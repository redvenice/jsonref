His aim was to bring art out of the galleries, and to use the postal service as an element of the artwork.Now, in 2020, as coronavirus rages through the city, the people behind Civilization – a singular print publication stuffed full of the musings of random New Yorkers – are reviving the concept. For $3 (£2.40), which you pay through their online store, they’ll send you a personalised letter. Open the eccentrically stamped envelope and you’ll find a four-page message that starts with your name, and an admission that the writer misses you.Judging by the work-in-progress I’ve seen, the missive then goes on several peculiar tangents including a recipe, a playlist, a dice game, a graph charting the writer’s mental health, a list of medication the writer is taking, the word “quack” interspersed at regular intervals for no apparent reason, and the kind of sex- and drug-related ramblings that characterise the paper.“The idea initially was to try and give people content that wouldn’t be tied to the virus, some kind of alternate newsletter that could be a distraction,” says Lucas Mascatello, who co-founded Civilization with Richard Turley and Mia Kerin. “It seems like the mail is only for garbage and news – bills, government information, the occasional card or invitation. It’s really exciting to get something special, a letter or anything. I think in our time that alone is a pretty artistic gesture. It was definitely inspired by Ray Johnson.”Over the course of a couple of years, Civilization has published four issues, earning a cult following – the Japanese fashion designer Junya Watanabe has used its distinctively dishevelled art on some of his clothes. It is in a broadsheet newspaper format, but instead of stories, carefully formatted from section to section – or indeed any useful information at all – Civilization jams together a myriad of abject, horny, banal andor chemically enhanced ponderings from anonymous New Yorkers.This torrent of text is displayed in columns that sometimes escape from their grid format and race to other parts of the page, and is interspersed with drawings, sidebars but – in defiance of our image-saturated age – precious few photographs.“In all newspapers now, you have your arts feed, the business news – everything’s in verticals,” says Turley (who used to art-direct the ’s G2, before working as a creative director on Bloomberg Businessweek and MTV). “I loved the idea of newspapers being far less organised, with a sense of adventure as you worked your way through them.”It all adds up to a compelling portrait of modern New York, a window into the fears, urges and obsessions of people wedged on top of one another 24 hours a day. But now that New Yorkers have been forced to self-isolate, Civilization has changed too. With the letter, it no longer expresses a cacophony, but intimacy, one person trying to reach another across the ide.These days, that’s what we use the internet for: but Civilization is determinedly print, reviving formats that are close to extinction. “The whole point is to make that physical connection,” Turley adds, saying that with self-isolation, “there are no more physical connections any more in our little world, beyond our nearest and dearest if you’re lucky enough to be cooped up with them”.Coronavirus, he points out, has added a layer of anxiety to the idea of physical objects passed from one person to another. “This idea of a piece of paper going into an envelope and someone picking it up and opening it, it’s almost a bit dangerous. There’s almost a layer of threat attached to it – it could be virus-infected. But we really liked the idea of tactility. There’s going to be a real absence of it while we keep two metres apart from each other for the foreseeable future.”And not just tactility – the hope is that the letters will start off an ongoing correspondence with Civilization’s readers. “More than anything I want the people getting these letters to feel like they can write back, like the thing can live on and evolve,” says Mascatello, a journalist who studied fine art. “That’s what I really like about Ray Johnson.”“I’d love people to write back,” Turley agrees. “We’ll do a few of these: the next might be a postcard, another might be an interview with someone.” What counts is the participation: at a time of loneliness and fear, reaching out to another human being using the age-old means of ink and paper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232739b07c190d31462cfd6999f1781b10d8d3c9/0_372_6484_3887/master/6484..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=470b99f8306c1b8517902b0d9b90680e","title":"a glimpse of something wonderful great pivotal moments in pictures magnum photographers","story":"A kiss by the sea, a disco in Wolverhampton, the shoot that made Marilyn Monroe ... ‘turning point’ images by Magnum photographers are being sold for $100 apiece to aid Covid-19 relief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71d1e9b39e3cd707097b310ebdef78e2f5f8893a/1577_1063_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b2e7ca6c937bd14aaba4eb09f647a32","title":"cineworld talks with landlords and studios to weather coronavirus","story":"World’s second-largest cinema chain hopes for deals with banks after closing venuesCineworld, the world’s second-largest cinema chain, is in talks with landlords and film studios as it tries to save cash after it was forced to close all of its cinemas worldwide.The company, which has 787 cinemas in 10 countries, said it was talking to its banks about its “ongoing liquidity requirements” and suspended idends to shareholders as it tries to weather the coronavirus crisis.Cineworld said it was halting all unnecessary spending as it made “every effort” to lessen the financial impact of the closures.“This is a situation impossible to imagine a few months ago,” the London-listed company told investors on Tuesday. “This is a painful but necessary process as before the onslaught of the Covid-19 virus, we were excited and confident about the group’s future prospects.”Executive directors, led by the chief executive Mooky Greidinger, will “defer” payment of their full salaries and bonuses for an unspecified amount of time “given the impact of Covid-19 on many of our employees”.The company warned last month that in a worst-case scenario, total closure of its cinemas for three monthscould possibly lead to a breach of its covenants and an inability to pay its debts.Cineworld angered staff when it immediately start laying off staff after closing its cinemas in the UK, which includes the Picturehouse chain, last month. After a public backlash the company subsequently moved to furlough staff under the government’s job retention scheme.The company also made a thinly veiled swipe at the Hollywood studio Universal, which has decided to make expected blockbuster Trolls World Tour available on all digital and pay-TV platforms globally on 10 April, instead of delaying its launch for an exclusive release in cinemas later in the year to help operators recover.“With very few exceptions, the good relationships we have built up over the years have been supportive and understanding of our efforts,” the company said.The company, the UK’s biggest operator, said it would continue to “monitor” the progress of its $2.1bn (£1.7bn) deal to buy Canada’s Cineplex.

Our new InVicto ventilator does this, not only helping to save lives but also preserving crucial oxygen reserves at a time when global supplies are under considerable strain.”James Fisher is the latest in a string of companies to answer Boris Johnson’s call for companies to urgently design and produce new ventilators.Defence contractor Babcock said on Monday it will manufacture 10,000 such machines. Dyson, the manufacturing firm run by billionaire inventor Sir James Dyson, has received a UK government order for 10,000. Both devices still have to pass stringent MHRA tests before they can be accepted for medical use.Ventilator Challenge UK, a consortium including more than a dozen engineering firms, has an order for 15,000. It expected to deliver 30 this week, but could take until early next month to reach its 1,500-a-week peak production target.A ventilator is a machine that helps a person breathe by getting oxygen into the lungs and removing carbon dioxide.The Mercedes Formula 1 team said on Tuesday it will this week begin delivering up to 10,000 breathing devices to the NHS, as part of F1’s Project Pitlane effort. The continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, which help coronavirus patients breathe more easily but are not ventilators, were developed by Mercedes engineers in partnership with University College London and doctors at its linked hospital. The devices are being produced at a rate of 1,000 a day at the Mercedes factory in Brixworth, Northamptonshire. The entire facility has been repurposed to produce the CPAP devices, with 40 machines that would normally produce F1 pistons and turbochargers dedicated to the rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75eec68661824dfc6135297c809cc7f94375e060/49_376_4019_2411/master/4019..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10153a9cc6090cb359fd1f1e8591feaf","title":"wellcome trust urges firms to donate 6bn for covid 19 research","story":"It is ‘the best investment your business can make’, says medical research charity The Wellcome Trust is calling on big businesses to donate $8bn (£6.4bn) for research into developing diagnostic tests, therapies and vaccines to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.Jeremy Farrar, the director of the London-based medical research charity, said a huge investment in scientific research was “the only exit strategy” to save millions of lives and drag the global economy out of an inevitable recession.Farrar said that while businesses and governments had acted fast to help support staff and keep the global economy ticking along, the only long-term solution was to quickly develop vaccines and treatments.“The only exit strategy for this that I see is the development of diagnostics, therapies and vaccines,” he said. “That’s the only way we can return to normal.”On a conference call later on Tuesday, Farrar will tell the chief executives of the world’s biggest companies that pledging funds to the Covid-Zero fund “is the best investment your business can make today”.He said: “Businesses and governments are rightly concerned with tackling immediate concerns – how to support staff, keep trading and bolster economies. But we also need a way out of this pandemic as fast as possible.”Farrar, who is an infectious disease researcher as well as director of the Wellcome Trust, said: “Drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostics are the only way we have of saving lives, bringing this pandemic to an end and preventing it reappearing. This is the only exit strategy – but we do not have the funding we need to execute it.”He said that unless businesses and governments provide funds now, Covid-19 and the economic damage caused by rolling lockdowns “will continue to plague the world”.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Farrar said: “We want business leaders to give a small proportion of the money they are dedicating to coping with this crisis, to solving it. We hope that governments will follow their example. Otherwise, this is a global issue that will continue to plague the world – and businesses – for months, if not years, to come.”Farrar will appeal directly to multinational business leaders during the World Economic Forum (WEF) weekly Covid-19 video conference call on Tuesday.He will tell business bosses scientists are “working at tremendous pace” to develop vaccines, test existing drugs that could treat Covid-19 and improve diagnostic tests. “But they’re running out of funding fast, which means new developments may never reach clinical trials and, ultimately, achieve regulatory approval.”Madonna, the Facebook founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and the credit card provider Mastercard have already pledged millions to the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, which Wellcome launched in partnership with the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation and forms part of the fresh initiative.Farrar said an initial $8bn was needed by the end of April to develop drugs and vaccines and to start to scale up production across the world – and indicated that much more money would be needed in the future.The funds will be split between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator and the Foundation for New Innovative Diagnostics (FIND). Money will also be provided to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) solidarity response fund, to ensure scientific innovations reach the people who need them the most. The breakdown is as follows:Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of CEPI, the global alliance leading efforts to rapidly advance the development of Covid-19 vaccines, said: “The spread of Covid-19 is a global humanitarian and economic crisis. While a range of social-distancing measures have been implemented in countries and regions across the world, the development of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics is the most effective way to permanently halt the global spread of the disease.“We are all in this together – all of us facing this same threat – and it’s down to all of us to influence what happens next. At this pivotal moment we urge the business sector to join governments and philanthropies in offering vital financial support to science, which is the only way to bring this pandemic to an end.”The initiative is called Covid-Zero because by securing the funding, it aims to achieve zero deaths, zero new cases and zero lockdowns as soon as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb8f05a33d22a1173b15d29815f80d6acce90c7/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89f5966de119c51ecdb34280b0f322a2","title":"coronavirus celebrity influence criticism","story":"With no red carpet premieres or awards shows, the only stars being clapped for are healthcare workers every evening as people rely on each other for unityWe Are the World. In 1985, the omniscient eyes of Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan and seemingly every other top artist witnessed what was obscured from our living room windows. It took Grammy winners to tear our hearts and wallets open to the struggles of starvation in Africa, to the tune of more than $60m. The artists whose voices personally shook our inner-core were the same philanthropists we trusted to enlighten us on issues larger than our own infinitesimal lives.With the entire global population in varied stages of coronavirus quarantine in 2020, the time has never been been more opportune for our favorite artists to relieve the world once again. Unfortunately for those with blue checkmarks on Twitter and Instagram, the era of star-studded thoughts and prayers appears to be over.When Elton John and some of biggest musicians in the world livestreamed a Covid-19 benefit concert in front of 8 million, the other 7.45 billion captive viewers opted out.The celebrity tune-out continued on social media.Wonder Woman Gal Gadot and her gang of fellow actors inspired a thousandfold more criticism and cringe than goodwill for their atonal rendition of John Lennon’s unifying-with-no-heaven manifesto Imagine.Vanessa Hudgens quashed any hope for a celebrity epidemiologist to emerge when she wokefully expressed to her fans: “Even if everybody gets it, like yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible … but inevitable?”When tips on maintaining physically safe-distanced fitness routines from their indoor pools and remote personal trainers on video chat failed to save the world, the cultural elite wised up to content people were actually seeking.Through multiple failed attempts at prying relevance from the vice grip of a global pandemic, the celebrity industrial complex quickly pivoted its outreach strategy from unification and togetherness to one of cautious utility and ominous warning.Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Samuel L Jackson and even David Letterman popped out of the coffin to echo World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warnings about maintaining social distance and “staying the fuck at home” with cute songs and selfies.Driven by a narcissistic and possibly sociopathic desire to parent, what happens when no one listens to the celebrities that know best during a time of crisis? If the rich and famous are unable to guide our moral compass, who serves as the magnetic north?To date, not one star has been able to approach the meteoric Covid-19 stardom of Dr Anthony Fauci, longtime US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director. Fauci’s press conferences and messaging have inspired trending hashtags, fan pages, memes and even bobbleheads and prayer candles. Holding his role since 1984, Fauci never had any cause to become a household name, until now.Some of the best creative inspiration in history has come from those not born into the monopoly of creativity. Fauci, Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, and even polarizing Donald Trump have captured the nation’s attention with their regular public responses and working solutions to the coronavirus crisis.Where government officials and doctors are now the celebrated authorities for news and knowledge, people stuck at home are finally relying on each other for unity and entertainment. Happy hours are taking place between friends who may have never been able to grab a drink together in real life, while an entire cottage industry of backgrounds for the video chat platform Zoom has popped up.The meme-makers on Reddit and lip-syncing dancers on TikTok are getting the nation to connect and pay attention with their daily challenges, pranks and heartfelt safety warnings. They’ve turned Covid-19 into the great equalizer, proving that it takes a good thought to have influence, not the other way around.With no red carpet premieres or glamorous awards shows, the only stars being clapped for are healthcare workers every evening at 7pm. When Tom Hanks revealed he had coronavirus, we realized celebrities really are just like us. And that’s what’s disappointing.It might be a reflection of not only the pandemic, but of the times in general, that celebrity influence is waning. Sure, the K-pop supergroup BTS routinely induces fans into fainting across the globe, but we will probably never have another king of pop who can rally the entire planet into caring and taking action.Thirty-five years after We Are the World, we’re left to wonder, who actually was the we?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35f3bda266be6647455fa279f111c1781fe2a18e/0_0_4064_2440/master/4064..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa76248c4940397c945f7182e8803cb9","title":"lockdown britain victorian class divide","story":"With living space, gardens and local area dictating our day-to-day happiness, the wealth gap has never been more glaringThe latest weekend in the coronavirus crisis was a tale of two lockdowns. Scotland’s chief medical officer was caught contradicting her own instructions and escaping to her second home, a mistake for which she paid with her job. In London, Brockwell Park was closed on Sunday after 3,000 people had visited the day before, many apparently using the space to picnic and sunbathe.Our experiences of the lockdown are shaped by class. How can they not be, when the rich have escaped to second homes, when bus drivers and nurses are dying on their jobs, and when our ability to tolerate large amounts of time at home or to properly self-isolate is determined by how much space we have at our disposal? Space – how it’s apportioned, how it’s governed, how it’s made available to some and denied to others – is always political. The middle classes, accustomed to constant mobility while valorising the home as a place of comfort and safety, balk at the thought of being unable to up sticks at will.For the urban working class, meanwhile, trapped inside flats where children have no option other than sharing bedrooms or “affordable” homes built to minimal space standards, there’s not so much choice. In such circumstances local parks are one of the only forms of escape: access to open spaces when you have no private outdoor space is vital to public health. City parks have always been about more than just leisure. Victorian reformers such as the physician John Snow, who established the link between cholera and poor sanitation, and the statistician William Farr lent their weight to middle-class campaigns for urban parks that might improve their own health through the improvement of working-class environments. In 1839 Farr noted how “a park in the East End of London would probably diminish the annual deaths by several thousand … and add several years to the lives of the entire population”.The cultural historian Joe Moran, writing in 2004, noted how “the reality of uneven development” – the way technology forces massive changes in some areas of life while leaving others untouched – means that “our surroundings become out of sync with the needs of the present and we muddle through with outmoded layouts and dilapidated systems”.Right now, our immediate surroundings are all we have, and we are being encouraged to imagine that every home and immediate neighbourhood is as comfortable and well-resourced as the next: that everyone has a garden, a computer, a quiet room to study or work in, and a supermarket and an open space nearby.Moran adds: “We rarely think about the collective logic of houses, their increasing connection with global systems of production and consumption, and their crucial relationship to the other spaces of everyday life.” Now we are being forced to consider those crucial relationships, such as the availability of fresh, inexpensive food within walking distance of home. Not takeaways or off-licences, but the fresh food you need to stay healthy.Working from home, too, is a convenience available to those whose jobs tend to involve words and numbers – better remunerated, if no less precarious, in the “knowledge economy” – rather than people and objects. For many on low incomes, internet connection is patchy, slow and only available on phone screens while paying through the nose for data. (Remember how Labour, last November, promised free  broadband for all, and how everyone who already had superfast broadband laughed?)For many people, life at the moment resembles an endless Sunday afternoon. That presents few problems if spending Sunday afternoons – that weekly appointment with invisibility when, according to Alan Bennett, “the spirit falters” – trapped indoors is well-nourished, calm and convivial. Less so in small houses with cardboard-thin walls, the washing machine running at full pelt in the open-plan kitchendiningliving room and the telly turned up to be heard over it. There comes a time when you have to get out before one of you – perhaps all of you – will explode.I grew up in one of those houses, a “starter home” that people end up living in for 40 years because they can’t afford to “trade up”. They are, to use Nye Bevan’s term, not homes but “rabbit hutches”, designed as if to weaponise nuclear families against each other. As Bevan underlined in his revolutionary stint as both health and housing minister between 1945 and 1951, there was no point in establishing a universal health service if he wasn’t also to try to establish a universal right to decent, spacious housing in equitable environments.For all the trauma caused by the coronavirus, I can’t help but hope that, on the other side of it, we will better understand what we need to live well, and demand more. In comparison with most other rich countries, British people are incredibly badly housed, and are expected to treat open spaces as a luxury not a right. There’s only so long you can keep fit and carry on, as instructed, when you’ve no room to swing a cat.Graham Medley, an adviser to the government on coronavirus, made an awkward but relevant point when he highlighted the potential damage caused by trapping people for too long in a home environment that is influenced, in an absolute and quantifiable way, by class. The lasting social effects of coronavirus will only be seen more clearly once they are understood through the prisms of social class, economic disadvantage, and the ways that our environment can work against us, according to how much power we have to influence it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1c8906f5d9b2f86ba238ff252172833cb660755/124_139_3191_1914/master/3191..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cd21d7758d944074eddbf03d6cb66c9","title":"value key workers low pay","story":"If those who care for us are to be first, not last, we have to look at the conditions that drive wage stagnation and insecurityThis weekend brought the news that two workers at London’s Pentonville prison, Bovil Peter and Patrick Beckford, had died with symptoms of Covid-19. “Symptoms” is nowadays a euphemism for “they weren’t tested”, and a grim reminder of the hundreds of thousands of key workers we are asking the world of, but whose selflessness is not being reciprocated.These are tragedies laced with guilt for all of us: plainly, the most dangerous place to be during this epidemic is in a densely populated care environment, whether a hospital, school or prison. People work in them because they have a passion, but also because there is no alternative, and they do so on all our behalves.Prison officers have always been the unsung heroes of public duty: never quite macho enough for the people who glorify the armed forces always a bit too authoritarian for those who valorise nurses. They are some of the most inventive and diligent people working anywhere in the business of caring for others, but they have generally done so without much credit.This crisis is forcing an urgent re-evaluation of that, along with all those other jobs that were previously classed as low-value yet now turn out to be the most important in the country. Words are not enough, and nor is clapping you can praise care workers to the skies, but if you’re paying them the minimum amount in 15-minute segments, without security of hours or of employment, without sick or holiday pay, then the praise is hollow.You can wax sentimental about the holy vocation of nursing, but you cannot then bring second-year students on to the frontline to fight coronavirus and still expect them to pay their tuition fees. You cannot claim, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told Andrew Marr on Sunday, that this isn’t the right time to talk about pay rises it is the best and only time to talk about pay rises, when we have finally realised, with a jolt, just how much we rely on people who put their jobs ahead of their own safety.Yet this is about more than money: Keir Starmer accepted the Labour leadership on Saturday with the rousing Old Testament statement about all key workers, cleaners, paramedics, carers, porters: “For too long they’ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.” But what would it actually mean to put these jobs first? Money is some of the answer, but we also have to look at the conditions and assumptions that drive wage stagnation and the steady erosion of security.There is nothing radical in the observation that jobs are often described as low-skill, when actually they are just poorly paid. More radical, yet still accurate, is the assertion that they are characterised as “low-skill” deliberately. Caring is a job of tremendous skill, hard as well as soft. And while there is a huge amount of bolt-on expertise that employers require, from administering medicines to dealing with dementia, this is not reflected in any career progression. It is not unusual for a carer in her 40s to be on the same hourly rate, adjusted for inflation, that she was on at 18.This has been systematic, not accidental. Without progression, the wage bill can remain reliably static, which is the only way the financial architecture of the sector makes sense.There is often better progression in public sector work, but the combination of the austerity-years pay freeze and a new normal (extending even to the police) of people at the start of their career being expected to work voluntarily, which itself erodes starting salaries, has had a striking effect on these jobs.Ironically, Theresa May was right when she famously said that a nurse might use a food bank for “complicated reasons”. Of course there’s a very simple reason – that nurse is not being paid enough. But the feedback loop between the private and public sectors – low pay, insecurity and poor conditions legitimised in one sector and migrating to another – is actually quite complicated.And there’s an overarching fallacy, that a job many people could do must be inherently low in value. By these lights, huge numbers of people – cleaners, drivers, shop assistants – are without prospects, being so replaceable. The times are testing this assumption to destruction – when you’re looking for the people whose courage we need in order for civilisation to survive, you don’t have to look much further than the postal worker or the hospital porter.In the immediate term, putting key workers first means personal protective equipment it means collective and determined effort to strip as much risk as possible out of essential jobs that simply wouldn’t get done if everyone looked out for themselves. But there will be an era after coronavirus and one thing to carry into it will be a determination never again to think, talk about or treat people as though logic demands they should be screwed down to their lowest possible price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c6a1b9ecb6ad5fe564085849317a604b8178568/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71d93dd061ed8520945e1c76cbf0f638","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of vivid","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘vivid’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘vivid’.Share your photos of what vivid means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 8 April at 10am.

This is the opposite of Covid-19,” said the study’s lead author, Prof Russell Viner, of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.“Data on the benefit of school closures in the Covid-19 outbreak is limited but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small compared with other infection-control measures such as case isolation and is only effective when other social isolating measures are adhered to.”Viner, who is president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the benefit gained from closing schools had to be weighed against the costs. “Children’s education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most.”He also highlighted the need to start working out how to return students to education and keep them in school safely.“Countries that have closed schools, such as the UK, have to now ask hard questions about when and how to open schools. Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms, increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes should be considered if restrictive social distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time.”Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who is one of the key epidemiologists advising the government, said: “While school closure as a measure on its own is predicted to have a limited effectiveness in controlling Covid-19 transmission, when combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households and thus ensuring transmission declines.”Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said the UCL study suggested the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs imposed on children and their families.“It also underlines how the assumptions used in modelling the Covid-19 pandemic may rest on very flimsy foundations in terms of scientific evidence. This work suggests that UK schools could and should begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through.”The study team included researchers from UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, University of Cambridge and University of Sydney. The study is published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal.A government spokesperson said: “The decision to close schools was taken in line with scientific advice on how to limit the spread of the coronavirus. We asked most children to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.“Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the children who are most vulnerable. We will reopen schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3fe0bc44c15b3407f58e7803be800807badd16/809_669_2109_1266/master/2109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f03b44691d34f27875a8324a646784","title":"industrial sized pig and chicken farming continuing to rise in uk","story":"Number of large-scale, intensive farms with upwards of 40,000 birds or 2,000 pigs is increasing, driven by demand for cheap meatNew figures reveal that the number of large industrial-sized pig and chicken farms in the UK continues to rise, with close to 2,000 across the country.Driven in part by supermarket pressure to keep prices low and consumer demand for cheap meat, the growth of industrial farming remains isive.Intensive pig and poultry farms have been linked to local bioersity damage from ammonia emissions and to detrimental impacts on local communities including noise pollution, increased traffic, and potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and air pollutants. It is also seen as a driver of deforestation in South America, through its reliance on protein-rich crops such as soya as animal feed.The intensification of the poultry sector has also generated local conflict with units often built in regional clusters surrounding slaughterhouses and factories. The Cluck Off campaign in Rushden, Northamptonshire, is fighting Bedfordia’s proposal for a six-shed unit for 314,000 birds, while in Horham and Southolt, Suffolk, locals are trying to stop Epigs Ltd’s plans for 12 poultry houses producing 800,000 chickens every eight weeks.The National Farmers’ Union says farm size is not the critical factor in dictating the welfare of birds. “It is crucial we recognise that animal husbandry and stockmanship are the greatest factors that determine animal health and welfare, not farm size or system of production,” said its chief poultry adviser, Gary Ford.Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming hopes that Brexit will lead to a new policy direction, supported by political and public pressure: “We’re at a crossroads and have an opportunity to reinvent British food and farming.

It requires barely any prep, and it’s endlessly adaptable: use yellow or red split peas instead of green, if that’s all you can get hold of honey, molasses and agave nectar are more than useful stand-ins for maple syrup and substitute fresh parsley for the coriander, if need be. And if you’re making it for children or for the spice-averse, simply leave out the jalapeño altogether and use paprika instead of chipotle.One-tray pork and mushroom pastaKA: Again, use what you have – shiitake mushrooms are a good swap for oyster (they’re cheaper, too), ditch the paccheri for another large-ish pasta tube such as tortiglioni or rigatoni, and try beef mince instead of pork if you have to – it won’t be the same, but needs must.Herby cabbage and potato gratin with gruyère and ricottaKA: If the local supermarket’s run out of desiree potatoes, another good all-rounder such as estima or vivaldi will also do the trick. If there’s no gruyère in the chiller cabinet, try comté, beaufort or emmental, and for ricotta, go for fromage frais or good old cottage cheese.Baked cauliflower with spices, spinach and tomatoKA: If you can’t find black mustard seeds, use yellow, or three-quarters of a teaspoon of mustard powder, or up to a tablespoon of ready-made mustard. Again, parsley makes a decent stand-in for the coriander, while you can replace the spinach with any other delicate green, or use frozen.KA: There’s no reason you have to cook this favourite brunch on the stovetop. It works just as well in the oven, which if anything makes it easier to prepare, too. Use any tinned white beans you have to hand, and in the absence of harissa use dried or fresh chilli to taste instead.Roast roots with butter alla diavolaKA: If you can’t get turnips, this treatment work on just about any other root veg, too, from carrots and potatoes to celeriac and parsnips failing them, squash would make a handy sub as well.Tomato and chicken traybakeKA: Swap tinned tomatoes or passata for fresh, if need be, and swap the thyme for any other soft herb you have to hand (oregano or marjarom, ideally, though there’s nothing wrong with parsley or coriander if that’s all you can get dried oregano or herbes de Provence would be another option). This treatment also works a treat on fish – whole or fillets, fresh or frozen and defrosted – though if you do go down that road, bake the tomatoes and seasonings alone for the first 10 minutes, then add the fish and, depending on size and cut, scale down the remaining cooking time as required.Braised hispi cabbage with chorizo and chickpeasKA: If the shops are out of hispi (it’s also known as pointed and sweetheart cabbage), try any other green cabbage you can find, even a young, firm savoy. Soured cream or Greek yoghurt can take the place of the creme fraiche if all else fails.Date traybake with toffeeKA: Dried figs will do the job of the mejdool dates, if need be, while honey, maple syrup, or molasses will all add the caramel sweetness of date syrup if that proves hard to get hold of.KA: The warm milk infusion is good enough to drink just as it is, and you can easily mix and match the spices used to suit availability and personal taste (if you can’t find cardamom, say, add a touch of nutmeg to the mix – combined with the cinnamon, it makes an OK substitute – while allspice can take the place of the cloves).KA: Any soft fruit or berries will top off this sponge cake version of the British summer classic in style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b848ec71ea559e54426fa61426342dc72e8aa932/1041_967_944_566/master/944..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d131ef08a6b0e3dbfd4ab24f891a351","title":"primark announces wage fund for garment workers","story":"Pledge comes in response to claims that order cancellations to minimise Covid-19 losses have hurt millions of workers in the developing worldPrimark, one of the UK’s most popular retailers, has announced it will create a fund to help pay the wages of the millions of garment workers affected by its decision to cancel tens of millions of pounds worth of clothing orders from factories in developing countries across the world.The pledge followed sustained criticism of the fashion retailer after data from the Bangladeshi and Garment Exporters Association (BGMEA) revealed it had cancelled all orders already placed with suppliers.Collectively brands including Primark, Matalan and Edinburgh Woollen Company have cancelled £1.4bn and suspended an additional £1bn of orders in Bangladesh alone as they scramble to minimise losses in the face of the Covid-19 epidemic. The move has already seen more than a million Bangladeshi garment workers lose their jobs or be sent home without pay.Primark has announced that it will create a fund to help pay the wages of workers linked to orders that were due for shipment in the month after they were cancelled in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.However, the brand also stipulated that the wage compensation would be adjusted to take into account government support packages, a caveat that has caused confusion among suppliers and industry bodies.“While we welcome Primark’s announcement that they will compensate workers for the wages they will lose as a result of these cancelled orders, it is not clear enough what they mean,” says Rubana Huq, chairperson of the BGMEA. “Wage compensation should not take government loans into consideration. These brands have existing business commitments with their suppliers that are their responsibility to honour.”Factory owners in Bangladesh also asked for further clarity about whether Primark would agree to pay invoices for any of the completed orders it has cancelled or for any of the raw materials already purchased by suppliers.Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, all of Primark’s retail outlets have closed, with monthly losses estimated at £650m. Primark chief executive Paul Marchant said that the company already has £1.6bn of paid-for stock in stores that it currently cannot sell.“Every one of our stores around the world is closed. With a backlog of stock in stores, depots and in transit, we have had to make the very difficult decision to cancel orders for future stock,” he says.“Finding a way to ensure that workers in our supply chain in these countries are paid has been a priority over the past two weeks and we are pleased that this fund will provide relief to these workers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2341b49034daa22d441da5a5a359fd381e614207/0_418_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=573bb23e1a16bc83cc248d0210998d2a","title":"global health policy can we manage the ever increasing rise of diabetes","story":"More than 400 million people have diabetes. While the condition can be treated effectively in the west, in low-income countries there is a need to improve access to insulin, medical devices, and health programmes to ensure early diagnosis and careTogether with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes has become one of the world’s four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and one of the only chronic diseases that continues to increase in prevalence.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and in 2016 it caused 1.6 million deaths, making it the seventh leading cause of death. The WHO estimates deaths from diabetes will increase to 2.4 million in 2030 and 3.7 million in 2045.The pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through Global Health Progress, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease.But what’s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that “the dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition. It needs to take in issues such as a lack of trained health practitioners, inadequate supply chains and weak health systems in developing countries.”“Access is a complex issue,” says Helen McGuire, programme leader, noncommunicable diseases at global health organisation Path. “Failures of access in low-resource settings are rarely due to a single cause.“Barriers must be addressed by leveraging multi-sectoral partnerships, which bring the unique expertise and resources of governments, non-profits, and industry to the table. Solutions require a long-term approach addressing issues of quality, affordability, availability, acceptability, and sustainability.”Emma Klatman is a health systems specialist at the international diabetes charity Life for a Child, which is tackling type 1 diabetes in low and middle income countries, where mortality rates among young people are especially high.Living without treatment can have horrific consequences, she says, and young people are faced with “blindness, losing limbs, developing kidney problems, and they just remain chronically unwell. They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.”The charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes.It’s a point echoed by McGuire. “Self-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes – therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,” she says. “Co-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.”Next year is the centenary of insulin’s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.The first insulin pen was introduced in 1985 and immediately improved the accuracy of treatment. Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R\u0026ampD into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones.Sanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively.Working with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day.“Affordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.”Klatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families “are able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8c303935e35b3ae3afd3784d78e50cf9af43d2/1664_1470_4982_2989/master/4982..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da4e64dfb85b22b9bc3af498aa1284bf","title":"how are you celebrating your birthday under coronavirus lockdown","story":"If you are expecting a birthday while under practicing physical distancing due to coronavirus, we’d like to hear from youWith the UK in its third week of government measures to avoid the spread of coronavirus, we would like to hear from those who are celebrating their birthdays under lockdown.How will you be celebrating your birthday?

It is both accessible and wildly experimental, and, for a record that spawned a hit as massive as her cover of It’s Oh So Quiet, it is resolutely unique and strange, always existing at the intersection of art and pop.She wrote the record after moving to London, and, while it shares some of its predecessor’s affection for trip-hop and house music, it has a harder edge and hints at darker nights. In the techno-tinged pop sludge of Army of Me and Enjoy, you can see the origins of what would become an enduring fascination with digital technology.But it carries itself lightly in places, too, and is frequently gorgeous and glorious, particularly when it comes to the storytelling. Hyperballad is a folk tale of anxiety and love Isobel ushers itself along string-laden beats to weave a wonderful fable of a clash between the ancient and modern and Possibly Maybe is as sparse and minimal as Björk gets, stripped to its bare bones, and astonishingly beautiful with it.This masterpiece remains Björk’s greatest and most cogent record to date. Her first two albums had hopped around sounds, trying things on and shrugging them off, but Homogenic settles into an epic orchestral feel that marries itself to skittering, aggressive beats. Encountering a Björk record for the first time always leaves the feeling of never quite having heard anything like it before, but that is never more true than here, where the music pulls between icy and warm, robotic and natural. It is also drily funny at times, for which Björk rarely gets credit. “I thought I could organise freedom  How Scandinavian of me,” she belts out, on the pounding military march of Hunter.After Homogenic came a softening, and Vespertine, dealing with love and desire, is Björk at her most beautiful. She finds new textures in her voice, and its acrobatics are less flashy and more delicate, against an intricate world conjured up out of harps, music boxes and the clavichord. Among non-fans, there can be a perception that Björk is, at times, hard work, that her experiments in sound can be a chore to listen to, but this is simply sublime.The interplay between nature and technology, a longstanding concern, became explicit on this album “about the universe”, which was also released as a series of apps and turned into an educational programme to help teach schoolchildren about science. Bells and whistles aside, this is underrated in the Björk canon, and is packed with gems, from the dubstep-ish banger Crystalline, to the majesty of Virus, all wrapped around mind-bending, otherworldly time signatures. The remix album, Bastards, is also well worth tracking down.Björk’s live shows are ever-shifting experiences – you never know if you’ll get a full orchestra, a giant musical Tesla coil or a 12-strong flute club. This box set made a live album each out of shows around her first four records, plus a short bonus DVD, and it stands as a testament to the fact that she has long been one of the finest and most mesmerising performers in the world.Hips. Lips. Tits. Power., by Adrian DeevoyThis now infamous, very 90s cover of Q magazine got PJ Harvey, Tori Amos and Björk together for a very 90s music-press chat (“Would you spill their pint?”). Some of it hasn’t aged well, but, as a portrait of Björk in the early stages of her solo career, it has the curiosity factor, and it is a reminder of just how rapid her rise to fame was with Debut. “I guess I was lucky in that I became a public property in Iceland when I was 11, so I had 15 years of hardcore rehearsals before all of this hullabaloo,” she said.The Invisible Woman: A Conversation with Björk, by Jessica HopperIn this wide-ranging interview around the devastating yet restorative 2015 album Vulnicara, Björk broached the personal loss that inspired the record, and once again addressed the issue of male collaborators being credited with her arrangements and production. “I want to support young girls who are in their 20s now and tell them: You’re not just imagining things. It’s tough. Everything that a guy says once, you have to say five times.”‘People miss the jokes. A lot of it is taking the piss out of myself’, by Miranda SawyerThe playfulness in Björk’s work is often passed over, so it is wonderful to see her optimism and humour brought out in this Utopia-era interview. Sawyer nails the point that Björk has “worked in music for more than 30 years, so she’s called a pop star. But really, she’s an artist in disguise.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Oxygen was available through a mask on the ward he was admitted to on Sunday, but the move to intensive care on Monday strongly suggests that was not enough to help him with the breathing problems caused by the viral pneumonia that the virus triggers.Anyone who is put on a ventilator will need to be sedated, although they are not unconscious. A tube must be inserted into the patient’s windpipe, so that air and oxygen from the machine can be blown into the lungs. That takes the strain off the lungs while they recover.Ventilation is vital in most severe Covid-19 cases, which is why there has been a huge effort to obtain more machines and even encourage engineering businesses to switch production lines to make them.In the severest cases, patients are put on an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which can support both the heart and lungs where somebody is in a life-threatening condition.Johnson’s admission to intensive care comes shortly after the 10th day of the illness, which has been identified as a real danger point. During the first week, most people’s immune systems rally and manage to fight off the virus. Those who do not recover and continue to struggle for breath and have a fever often need help around the middle of the second week.In that second week, the immune system can sometimes go into overdrive. In its attempt to fight the virus, it creates what is called a cytokine storm, in which the immune system attacks the body’s own organs. The heart, the liver and kidneys are most likely to be affected and all of them can need to be supported by machines that can take over their function.Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, said: “It seems clear that the prime minister went to hospital because he had difficulty breathing. It seems he was initially put on oxygen, and was conscious.“But as often happens with Covid-19, his condition has now deteriorated so he has been admitted to intensive care.“We understand the PM is on a type of breathing support called Continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap), which is commonly used in treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. Experience in Italy and other European countries has shown that Cpap can be effective in Covid-19 patients, at least initially. Many Covid-19 patients progress to invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves a tube being put down the patient’s airway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c371dd0b5c6545c5c4f6b78e77b3ea7d853965a2/0_57_1478_887/master/1478.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8ed7118a475cb1c211ee56ea8f7db9ff","title":"tell us have you found a new job during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We would like to hear from people who are newly employed in jobs that have become ever more essential due to the lockdownThousands of new jobs delivering food and medicines, working in supply chains and in supermarkets have been created during the coronavirus pandemic.People who have been furloughed from their jobs or fired altogether will have filled some of these roles, along with the previously unemployed.We would like to hear from the people with new jobs doing essential work who have never worked in those areas before.What is your new job?

But focusing on connection, diet and sleep can helpI am enjoying lockdown more than I thought I would. I get up early, go for a very long walk with the dog, do a one-hour home workout later in the day, plus lots of writing, lots of reading, lots of music, a bit of telly. And I am lucky to be confined with a partner whose company I actually enjoy.So I am not currently depressed, although I know from experience that this can change quickly. But I hope that my experience of depression, and how I have learned to deal with it, can be of use to others who are in lockdown. In many way, this sense of universal anxiety has been a great leveller, in that millions of people who have no personal experience of mental ill health are getting an insight into what it might feel like.Here are a few tips and thoughts that have been of help to me, both in guarding against depression and dealing with it when it comes.1 Look after key relationships. Your partner, your children, parents and grandparents, siblings, closest friends. Really try to look out for them.2 Stay active. The temptation to do nothing is strong. Try to resist it.3 Exercise. It is vital to physical and mental wellbeing.4 Watch your diet. For many people, boredom  eating, dislocation  eating, loneliness  eating. It is important to be aware of it. Try to eat healthily.5 Keep an eye on the booze. Someone tweeted recently: “This is like Christmas without the fun!” I think we all know what they mean.6 Sleep. I have been struggling with this one. But an early night is a good night.7 Read books. Don’t be a 247 news junkie. Books that have nothing to do with the current crisis, fiction or nonfiction, can be such a wonderful release.8 Cut down on social media. Endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram is not healthy.9 Listen to music regularly.10 Even better – make music. I play bagpipes and they are out every day.11 Write down your thoughts. Keep a diary. Make lists.12 Keep in touch with the people you would normally be in contact with.13 Get in touch with someone you have lost contact with.14 Do something good for someone else every day.15 Do the easy things if you are finding it hard to do the difficult things.16 Stay curious. Try new things.17 Enjoy nature. If you follow me on social media, you will know I have been posting tree of the day photos ( has a tree of the week column). I cannot tell you how much pleasure I get on my morning walk deciding which tree to pick.18 Remember that all crises end eventually. By the time this one is over, there will have been a lot of death, a lot of grief, a lot of suffering. But it will end, and most of the world will still be here. So …19 Keep things in perspective. Don’t panic. And finally …20 See an opportunity in every setback. The whole world is going to have to take that approach when this is all over, but we can do it in our own lives now. Most people are being kinder. There is a boom in volunteering. There is more respect for so-called unskilled workers, more appreciation of NHS staff and carers. The air is cleaner. My asthma is better. My carbon footprint has shrunk from dreadful to almost Greta-like. I guess that is a long-winded way of saying try to look on the bright side.

Team USA would still be strong even without her thoughLast week when Simone Biles spoke to the press for the first time since the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, she failed to guarantee she would be back for the rescheduled Games in 2021. “I haven’t decided not to do it, but I haven’t really decided to do it,” she told the Wall Street Journal.This was not what we wanted to hear from one of the world’s most exciting athletes. Biles was heading into Tokyo 2020 as the overwhelming favorite to win her second consecutive Olympic all-around title. That would have been a fitting capstone for the 23-year-old’s record-breaking career. Though Biles had been adamant for the past year that she would retire after the 2020 Olympics, most assumed she would continue her career so she could compete in 2021 instead. Biles’ reasons for not immediately committing to next’s summer’s Olympics are sensible: the toll another year of training would take on her already aching body the desire to move on with her life and another year of dealing with USA Gymnastics, one of the institutions that enabled former team doctor Larry Nassar to abuse Biles and dozens of other athletes. “I don’t know if I can deal with USAG for another year,” she said.While I’m still betting on Biles being in Tokyo next year, it’s worth contemplating what a US effort without her would look like. She’s been a key part of the program for eight years and it’s hard to imagine the team without her.First, let’s be clear about one thing – the US would still take the women’s team title in Tokyo next year even without Biles. The American program has a deep bench, deeper than any other women’s program. There is definitely a fourth (or fifth or eighth) gymnast that can put up strong scores across the board and help the American women secure victory.But a Biles-less team win wouldn’t look exactly the same. The point margins over the other top teams would be slimmer. At the 2019 world championships, Biles’ floor score, for instance, was a point higher than the other two Americans, whose own floor scores were a point higher than the next best marks from Russia. The US will certainly be able to find another gymnast who can score in the same range as the other Americans but it’s unlikely that they will find one who will score as Biles would. In 2015, gymnastics blogger Lauren Hopkins pointed out that “between 2014 and 2015, the US team improved their final score by about two points. Of these two points, seven tenths came from Biles with the other 1.3 ided among the other four gymnasts.” And this was before she started extending her all-around margins into “fall more than once and still win” territory. Also, Biles competed on all four apparatuses in team finals during the last three major team championships. Replacing Biles means replacing four scores in the team final.And then there’s Biles’ formidable inidual medal haul. Biles in Tokyo probably means four gold medals – all-around, vault, beam, and floor. The US certainly has gymnasts that are capable of bringing in medals in all of those disciplines, but their medals are not as assured as Biles’ are. The best bet for a US gold without Biles is vault where Jade Carey excels.Biles is a three-time world champion on the balance beam but her record is, by her standards, spotty. If she hits, she is one of the favorites to win but if she misses – as she did in 2016 and 2018 – she may end up with a medal but it won’t be gold. But beam, in particular, is where the US is loaded with talent. There’s Kara Eaker, who would have been world champion in 2018 if not for a mistake in the finals, and Morgan Hurd, a world silver medalist in 2017. As for floor, the US is reasonably assured of walking away with a medal there as well, perhaps even gold. Even without Biles, the Americans boast some of the best tumblers in the world.And finally, the most prestigious inidual contest, the all-around final. Biles has dominated the all-around since her senior debut in 2013. The US certainly has other gymnasts who can win – the Americans won three consecutive Olympic all-around titles before Biles came on the scene – but their wins are not guaranteed. Sunisa Lee, like 2017 world champion Hurd and a couple of other Americans, can win the all-around title on a good day but only a good day. Only Biles can win it on a bad day.All of this prognosticating is based on what the Olympics would have looked like this summer. But 2021 is not 2020. Over the next 16 months, a lot will change. Perhaps there will be injuries to the current group of top contenders. The year before the Games entails some of the most arduous training of a gymnast’s career. The athletes, who were more than halfway through that year, will be forced to endure it all over again. For some, it will be too much. And there will be gymnasts who were already injured but will now perhaps have enough time to recover. In February, Asuka Teramoto of Japan ruptured her achilles. She was out of the picture for Tokyo 2020 but she could very well be back in the mix for 2021.Then there is a whole new crop of contenders who were too young to compete in Tokyo this year but will be 16 and therefore age eligible next year. Two of the most promising juniors who will now be able to compete in 2021 are Konnor McClain of the US and Viktoria Listunova of Russia. The former is the best junior gymnast in the US with enormous potential on balance beam the latter is the reigning junior world champion. (The International Gymnastics Federation is set to decide what to do about the new seniors in regards to the 2021 Olympics in the next two weeks.)Shortly after the Olympic postponement was announced, Yahoo Sports ran a story about McClain and her Olympic prospects if she competes at the 2021 Games. While McClain’s coach was circumspect about her chances, noting that the gymnast’s preparation had been oriented towards the 2024 Games, 2008 Olympic champion Shawn Johnson posited that McClain could be a potential rival for Biles due to the junior’s youthfulness. That was a ridiculous assertion. While McClain, who was just 32 days shy of 2020 eligibility, is an enormously talented gymnast and an exciting prospect for the future, she has yet to compete as a senior. McClain has a lot to prove before she can be considered a rival to the GOAT.So much can happen in a year. The future is always uncertain but it feels even more so during this pandemic. Biles, who has been a sure thing in gymnastics for the last eight years, won’t give us the certainty we’re desperately seeking by committing to 2021. She can’t even give herself that kind of assurance. Biles, like the rest of us, is going to have to take this one day, one week, one month at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cced036b788b5f859d57f1940ed77aab270a910/0_46_1078_646/master/1078..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5612c497367ee63a1fd753a5270b2d30","title":"my favourite game nick faldo greg norman 1996 masters","story":"Norman’s Augusta agony when surrendering a six-shot, final-round lead to Faldo was staggering and unforgettableThe Masters doesn’t start until the back nine on Sunday. As a 14-year-old, getting to the back nine on Sunday was an achievement in itself. BBC television coverage meant Augusta National was far more accessible in the 90s but parental rules provided the nasty counterargument when it came to a Sunday night and a golf tournament played in eastern standard time.By the time Nick Faldo and Greg Norman reached the 9th fairway on what was, for the Australian, the fateful date of 14 April 1996 I was losing the argument. Norman started Masters Sunday with a six-shot lead over the Englishman. He was still leading by three and had only 100 yards left to the pin. The familiar prospect of waking up on Monday morning to discover who had donned the Green Jacket was a live one.I don’t remember if Norman’s woeful approach, which spun back off the front of the 9th green, specifically earned me leeway from my father or if his act of kindness was a more general one. Norman’s advantage was two as he and Faldo strode to the 10th tee. There had, of course, been indications of what might happen next – not least throughout Norman’s career – but the lesson in how horrendously cruel sport can be was an invaluable one. Fifteen years later, I was at Augusta National as Rory McIlroy endured the most crushing of implosions on Sunday afternoon. As transpired with Norman, these provide lifelong points of reference. The agony of the “loser” resonates far more than the celebration of the champion.There was no particular cause to root for Faldo back then. If anything, the rump of support would have been with Norman, the more free-spirited of the duo. Faldo was an outstanding golfer, seeking his sixth major title, but he lacked the panache of a Ballesteros, Couples or Olazábal. Faldo’s cringeworthy winner’s speech at Muirfield in 1992 – as still available in all its ignominy on YouTube – implied he wasn’t really a man of the people. Norman had been the bridesmaid at Augusta in 1986 and 1987. He had multiple runner-up finishes, too, in the US PGA Championship and US Open. If his Open successes of 1986 and 1993 meant the Shark was hardly a pauper in respect of golf’s crown jewels, he was an underdog against Faldo. Scots love underdogs.Faldo’s splitting of the 10th fairway emphasised the smelling of blood. Norman was bleeding his pulled approach shot triggered another bogey. The lead, seemingly unassailable at the start of play, had evaporated by the time Norman three-putted from the 11th. His birdie attempt had touched the hole before a woeful 3ft attempt for par, over which he clearly had jitters.A wide-brimmed hat could barely disguise the shock on Norman’s face. Faldo was the one player he didn’t want to face when treading quicksand. If those of us looking on hoped for a joust over one of the most famous stretches in golf, we were dissuaded of any such notion. “Over the bunker” was the audible instruction issued to Norman from his caddie on the 12th tee. Instead, Norman’s bold play to a Sunday pin with a seven-iron resulted in disaster and the finding of Rae’s Creek. Faldo headed to 13 with a two-stroke lead.From there, the tale was of Norman’s visible despondency in front of the watching world. More water trouble, this time at the 16th, meant Faldo had four shots to play with over the closing two holes. His eventual margin of victory was five, 12 under par to minus seven. On the final green Faldo embraced Norman, the champion suffering pangs of regret about his role in one of sport’s most notable capitulations. “I genuinely feel bad for Greg,” said Faldo by the time he reached the Butler Cabin. Norman admitted: “I don’t know what happened.” He would be reminded of this Masters for decades to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dabb3b47f526903490b20e44da2e1f0e4b86526/0_41_6000_3600/master/6000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b436f7d57cfe63a0556b3350eb40d1c","title":"closing uk parks and public spaces tipping point coronavirus covid 19","story":"There is always compromise, always managed space – but banning exercise in this country would be a disasterYou can take our pubs and our shopping centres. You can wall us up behind the front door with Netflix and newsagent wine. But don’t take away our glimpse of the sky, that proscribed 30 minutes of brain-soothing, body-stretching exercise.Judging by the experiences of Spain, Italy and France, this is the next stage for the UK. Quite how long we can put off a complete ban on personal exercise is open to question. But a concerted effort is required here because, with the weather this week forecast to reach as a high as 23C, this really could be a tipping point.Public pressure suggests it’s coming. One of the most heartening aspects of the period of confinement has been a shared counter-commentary, the feeling, expressed often from the fringes, that this might just be a chance to reset and restart, to remake our world as a kinder, gentler place.It remains to be seen quite how this fits with the sheer effort of will required to ensure the No 1 UK trending Twitter topic on Sunday night was #selfishpricks, a response to the suspicion too many people had given in to weakness, cabin fever and springtime muscle memory and gone out to run or walk or lie around in public space.By Monday morning the health secretary, Matthew Hancock, had rowed back a little on the veiled threat to enforce a ban on outdoor exercise. But this in itself should be taken with a pinch of salt, at a time when nothing is off the table, no policy is fixed, and nothing that seemed extreme on Sunday night can be ruled out by Wednesday morning.Make no mistake. When this does come, when parks and public spaces are finally closed, it will be one of the most destructive side-effects of this pandemic to date. A disaster for physical and mental health a disaster for sport at recreational and junior levels and a disaster for the trajectory of both the national health and its keeper, the National Health Service.There are two issues here. Firstly, how serious is this problem really? Our cities are crowded places. Many people have no outdoor space at all. It is impossible to stay out of one another’s sight completely. No doubt there is a hardcore of the ill-informed, the antisocial and those who just won’t or can’t obey the rules. These groups should be ruthlessly policed. But most people do understand how to protect themselves.Jogging two metres from anyone else, dodging off the pavement, being aware at all times of your distance: these are habits the average citizen is learning to keep. One person’s enraging iPhone pic of a crowded park scene is another’s intricate network of carefully maintained personal spaces. Mainly, though, the prospect of a ban on outdoor exercise must be taken on its own terms. Any decision on public governance is a balance of cost and benefits. This one would be catastrophic for so many people.It is a mark of how perverse the situation is that the same department of health currently ordering the nation to stay inside was publishing advice in October 2019 urging us to do exactly the opposite. Public Health England’s paper states that “physical inactivity is responsible for one in six UK deaths and is estimated to cost the UK £7.4bn annually.”Yes, you read that right: one in six deaths. Inactivity is not a neutral state. It also has a profound cost. Loss of movement and physical activity is both habit-forming, and often irrecoverable for those of advanced age. Plus there is the more immediate effect on the nation’s mental health. The same government paper concludes: “Physical activity has significant benefits for health, both physical and mental, and can help to prevent and manage over 20 chronic conditions and diseases, including ... depression.”But then, we don’t need a study to tell us this. As long ago as the European plagues of the middle ages, green space and fresh air were being prescribed as balms to melancholia. Sport, exercise, sunlight: these are a form of preventative care for many people who experience mental health issues or skate close to the edge. Removing access to these things will come with a huge hidden cost.But it is also about sport and exercise, the absence of which hits young people hardest. As the government’s own report states: “There is strong evidence that regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits for children.” This stretches from teenagers whose physicality demands that, like dogs, they need to run around at least once a day, to those who benefit from being steered away from isolation.Sports science suggests there are permanent physical benefits to physical exertion in your growth years. Something irrecoverable will be lost when that right to exercise is taken away. It is a cost that will be felt by some more than others. Data suggests children from low-income backgrounds are already less physically active than those from wealthier backgrounds, and three times more likely to be obese by the age of 11.Confinement seems likely to supercharge this process, to further politicise exercise and the outdoors. If you have a garden, or space at home, or a parent with resources already engaged in curating your recreation, you will most likely find a way to continue that. For others the lockdown will mean chronic, often cramped inactivity.What, then, is the alternative? There are plenty of mitigating alternatives the government could look at before that point is reached. Policing public spaces more aggressively is one thing. But why not attack it from a better angle? Do we really want to be a nation that bans exercise before it bans smoking and the sale of tobacco? Surely better to ban eating or drinking alcohol in public if you really want to disperse the wrong kind of crowd? At another extreme, how about making everyone wear masks or a face covering in public?It is here that ideas of freedom and responsibility start to collide. Our social existence is built around things that restrict or funnel our access to the land around us, from street furniture, to rights of way and public spaces.

Anybody else get in global amounts of trouble?” It was only a matter of time before Louis CK, disgraced in 2017 when he admitted to masturbating in front of several female comedians, confirmed his comeback with a special. Sure enough last weekend, mid-lockdown and out of the blue, Sincerely Louis CK – recorded in Washington DC last year – was made available on his website. It is his first broadcast gig since becoming a major (if temporary) casualty of the #MeToo era.Like Aziz Ansari’s corresponding show a year ago, this set is hard to watch through any lens other than that of CK’s behaviour. And, of course, he addresses them, in a manner you may find less pious than Ansari’s, or less penitent, depending on how reprehensible you considered CK (or how much you loved his work) in the first place. Judging by this set, CK doesn’t think he did anything uniquely bad. Everyone has their sexual quirks, he argues, and now, he reports shamefaced, “everyone knows mine” – from Barack Obama to the Italian kid pointing at him recently in an airport.Towards the end, he fronts up to the issue of consent, reminding his audience that he sought consent from the women involved, but acknowledging (indirectly, via jokes about a similarity between the sounds of female sexual pleasure and slaves singing “Negro spirituals” in the fields) that that may not have been enough. This not-quite apology – heavier on self-pity than concern for the women involved – won’t be enough for those outraged by CK’s behaviour. But it’s all we’re getting, and at least it’s consistent with CK’s unsentimental worldview, which sees us all as amoral screw-ups struggling to get from cradle to grave with some shreds of dignity intact.That is the keynote in a show with a handful of jokes to recall CK’s once permanent residency on all those “world’s best” lists, and more that recall his too cynical 2016 Edinburgh festival show. You can’t say he’s not hunting big game, comedically speaking. He opens with a section on God that includes an unsparing riff on his mother’s recent death and cremation. God is summoned to Earth to clear things up with a five-minute press conference – which, coincidentally, gives sexual deviants a free pass but comes down hard on carnivores. (“How could you eat a perfectly fuckable pig?”)That’s far from the only routine in whose margins CK’s harassment scandal lurks, just out of vision. Elsewhere, there’s some straightforward baiting of liberal pieties, as with a routine about “retarded people” that feigns to strike a blow for social justice while savouring the phrase “retarded people” a little too much a riff on whether CK wants to “fuck kids” or not and another about a Japanese waitress with a funny accent. Sometimes, it’s all a bit of a strain: “I used to date a woman who was vegan. So I had to fuck her with my dick substitute.” Oh dear.Perhaps, now the veil has slipped, CK can no longer be bothered pretending to the loftier ideals that used to offset his more cynical material. But then some of his cynical gags here (the one about visiting boutique gift shops, say) are wickedly good, and there’s higher-minded material, too – on his grandfather’s flight from Hungary to Mexico, or on his relief, aged 52, that he now has only a manageable length of time left to live.On this evidence, it looks as if that time will be spent performing standup, even if – because the context’s changed and because that doesn’t seem to be bringing out CK’s best instincts – he may be doing so to smaller and less joyful audiences.• Available at louisck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97be5e49603ed15b9d257c1727eee029d75a5d19/467_97_4419_2652/master/4419..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fd8d9c763916b0eaeaa7357dbfb260e","title":"apple macbook air review 2020 near perfect consumer laptop","story":"Updated processors, a price drop and an excellent new keyboard only add to this fantastic traditional laptopApple’s latest MacBook Air has a new, fixed and more satisfying keyboard, improved processors and gets a price drop.From the outside essentially nothing has changed. The new 2020 MacBook Air looks just like the revamped machine launched in 2018, except it costs £200 less than its predecessor, with the base model starting at £999.In a world filled with convertibles, 2-in-1s and fancy tablet computers, the MacBook Air stands apart as an attractive design that is the pinnacle of the traditional laptop form. An instant classic.If you had a pair of callipers you might be able to tell that the new MacBook Air is 0.5mm thicker and 40g heavier than the old one, but there’s a good reason for that: a new keyboard that’s just a smidgen thicker. More on that in a moment.The 13.3in screen is crisp and beautiful, now supporting Apple’s True Tone technology, which adjusts the screens colours depending on ambient light. It was a feature restricted to the MacBook Pro in Apple’s laptop line until now.The 1.29kg MacBook Air compares favourably with rivals, but is heavier than tablet PCs such as Microsoft’s 775g Surface Pro 7 (1.13g with keyboard attached).It replaces the ill-fated butterfly keyboard and should render troubles with stuck keys a thing of the past. It also has double the key travel at 1mm of depth and a far more satisfying typing experience.The keys feel solid, depress far enough and are fairly quiet as laptop keyboards go. It is very close to being best-in-class, just behind the keyboard on Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 3.Apple’s Force Touch trackpad continues to be the very best you can buy on a laptop. It is large, precise and smooth: all-round excellent.A Touch ID fingerprint scanner is built into the power button in the top right corner of the keyboard. It works well as an alternative to passwords, but can only recognise three fingerprints. One day I hope Apple puts its excellent Face ID system in its laptops to match Microsoft’s excellent Windows Hello system in its computers.The MacBook Air as tested was the base model costing £999 with an Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.General computing performance was surprisingly good from the Core i3 version, including when connected to a 4K display. Where it struggled was attempting to do fairly complex edits to images in Affinity Photo or perform multiple tasks at once, such as downloading app updates and using relatively complex web apps in Chrome – something I’ve not noticed with any Core i5-powered machines in the last few years.If you’re a light computer user the Core i3 version will be perfectly adequate. But I would recommend most pay the extra £100 to upgrade to the quad-core Core i5 processor, which is far more capable and will be able to handle demanding programs and extensive multitasking, as you would expect from a computer costing £1,099.The MacBook Air lasts about eight to nine hours of general work, including using Chrome with about 10 or so tabs open, various chat apps, Typora text editor, Affinity Photo, Apple Mail and a few other bits – enough to get a work day done without having to reach for a charger.Worth noting in these difficult times that a 50-minute video call knocked around two hours off the usual battery life so you’ll need the charger more often.The computer is generally repairable too, although it was awarded only a 4 out of 10 for repairability by specialists iFixit, with downsides being the inability to upgrade the RAM or SSD.Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.The MacBook Air ships with Apple’s latest macOS 10.15 Catalina, which continues to be a mature and well-thought-out operating system that makes the most of Apple’s laptops.The most useful addition this time round is Sidecar, which turns an iPad into a second screen for your Mac – particularly useful if you’re stuck working from home and happen to have both a Mac and an iPad. As long as you’re on the same wifi network it works wirelessly and effortlessly, or you can use a cable.Catalina also brought expanded app support for those built using Mac Catalyst, which helps developers take their iPad apps and port them to the Mac. Twitter’s app is one example, but good ones are thin on the ground right now.The iTunes app has also been split into three apps: Apple TV, Music and Podcasts, which are generally better and faster.Various other options are available totalling to a price of £2,249 with everything maxed out.The 2020 MacBook Air has so many things going for it across form, function and sustainability.Very few machines are made with any recycled material, let alone as much as the MacBook Air. There is still some way to go to truly reduce the impact of consumer electronics on the environment, but Apple should be commended for pushing the industry forward in a similar manner to the Fairphone project.In form and function the MacBook Air is just a few shades short of the perfect traditional laptop. If you don’t want a more modern convertible, you’ll struggle to find a better consumer machine than this.The keyboard is finally as great as the trackpad, the battery lasts long enough for a work day, it’s light but strong and the screen is beautiful, while the little things such as Touch ID work great. You also get two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a long support life.Sure, the screen could have smaller bezels and the webcam could be better – why Apple hasn’t put its excellent Face ID into its laptops I have no idea. You can’t upgrade the RAM or storage after purchase, there’s no wifi 6 support, nor SD card slot or USB-A port, but by now most will have enough USB-C cables and accessories, and if not, now is the time to buy them.If you’re looking for an Apple laptop, this is the one to buy unless you need a beast such as the 16in MacBook Pro. Just spend the extra £100 and buy the MacBook Air with the Intel Core i5 processor, rather than the Core i3, at £1,099.Cons: average webcam, no wifi 6, no SD or USB-A, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.”Modly sparked a leadership crisis at the Pentagon when an audio recording surfaced of a speech he gave to the crew of the aircraft carrier, in which he denigrated the commander he had fired for having circulated a memo calling for more help for his crew, who had been stricken by a coronavirus outbreak onboard. The acting navy secretary’s apology came soon after Donald Trump said on Monday evening he would intervene in the situation, and hinted he might reinstate the former Roosevelt commander Captain Brett Crozier.“His career prior to that was very good. So I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on there because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day,” Trump said, while stressing that Crozier should not have circulated the memo.Referring to Modly and Crozier, the president added: “Two good people ... they were arguing. And I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments … So I may look into it in great detail. And I’ll be able to figure it out very fast.”In the recording of Modly’s speech on board the Roosevelt, published by the Task \u0026amp Purpose military news website, heckling can be heard from the crew during the speech, which was otherwise greeted with silence.Modly justified his decision to relieve Capt Crozier of command last week, on the grounds that his four-page memo requesting more help for his crew, and asking for them to be moved on shore at Guam, had been circulated to more than 40 people. It was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, but Modly did not accuse Crozier of the leak.“If he didn’t think that information was going to get out into the public in this information age that we live in, then he was a too naive or too stupid to be the commanding officer of a ship like this,” Modly said.In his apology on Monday night, Modly said: “I believe, precisely because he is not naive or stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship.”During Mody’s speech on Sunday, someone (presumably a crew member) can be heard yelling “What the fuck?” Crozier was a popular captain and video circulated on Friday of the crew massing on the deck of the Roosevelt to cheer and chant the captain’s name as he left the ship, walking down the gangplank to a waiting car.Modly criticised the crew for cheering, saying that they should think of the people of Guam, who were concerned about being infected by sick sailors brought ashore. He attacked the media, which he said were seeking to embarrass the navy, and accused Crozier of betrayal.“Everyone’s scared about this thing. But I tell you something – if this ship was in combat and there were hypersonic missiles coming at it, you’d be pretty fucking scared too,” he said, to a shout of “Whoa!” from the crew. “But you do your jobs.”At least four Democratic members of Congress and an independent, Justin Lamash, called for Modly’s immediate resignation.“Modly should be removed unceremoniously for these shocking remarks – especially after failing to protect sailors’ safety \u0026amp health. He has betrayed their trust,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said on Twitter, calling for a Pentagon investigation.David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesman and ex-marine, tweeted: “These remarks to sailors are unbefitting a senior leader and will only increase isiveness in the ranks. He has failed as a leader \u0026amp should resign.”After the recording of his speech was published, Modly issued a statement saying he had not listened to the recording but that “the spoken words were from the heart”.“I stand by every word I said, even, regrettably any profanity that may have been used for emphasis,” he said.Modly became acting secretary in November after the former navy secretary Richard Spencer was fired for dissenting from Trump’s attempt to exonerate a navy seal, Eddie Gallagher, who had been accused of war crimes and was demoted after being found guilty of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3fd9fbe6a9a5e71c03ad12927d9f63083f069d8/0_125_3770_2263/master/3770..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4be1c4828c011661efa48be66dc53fa7","title":"joe biden skeptical sanders supporters","story":"Democratic candidate is aggressively courting critical constituency of younger and left-wing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bidJoe Biden was not their first choice. In some cases, he wasn’t even their second or third. Now, as the all-but certain nominee, Biden is aggressively courting a critical constituency of younger and left-wing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bid.Last month, Biden stitched together a wide range of support from African Americans, suburbanites, and working class white voters to rack up wins across the country and amass an almost indomitable lead over his rival, democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. Yet missing from that coalition is the young and more liberal voters who overwhelmingly prefer Sanders’ call for political revolution to Biden’s promise of a return to “normalcy”.Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify after a isive primary battle that stretched into the summer convention, Biden is now amplifying his appeals to the party’s left.According to campaign officials, his team has for weeks quietly engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. The effort, spearheaded by senior Biden advisers, includes outreach to legacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood as well as newer, youth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement.Biden has also made overt gestures. He recently adopted a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system and embraced elements of Sanders’ tuition-free college proposal.“Let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator Sanders: I hear you,” the former vice-president said after sweeping three major primary contests last month. “I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.”There is a delicacy around the engagement, especially with Sanders still claiming his campaign has a “narrow path” to the nomination despite calls to bow out of the race. The left came tantalizing close to nominating a presidential candidate they hold up as a progressive champion only to watch in dismay as Biden, who is unquestionably more moderate, all-but vanquished those hopes, and with startling speed.There is a mutual understanding that the party must unify to defeat Donald Trump in November. But progressives also believe they have built sufficient leverage to press for sweeping policy concessions from Biden, particularly given the potentially worrisome lack of enthusiasm for his candidacy.“Joe Biden, as the moderate frontrunner, has to convince progressives to support him,” said Julian Brave NoiseCat, who directs Green New Deal strategy at the progressive think tank Data for Progress. “He needs more enthusiasm behind his campaign, and it’s been a bruising campaign cycle.”In interviews with progressive organizers, climate change has emerged as a key area where activists believe they can “push” the former vice-president, in part because combatting global warming draws broad support from every corner of the party. Several polls this cycle have found that Democratic voters rank climate change among their top three issues, often second only to healthcare.Data for Progress, along with climate staff from Washington governor Jay Inslee’s former presidential campaign, are among those urging the Biden team to prioritize climate change.Some progressives believe Biden, who spent decades in the Senate before serving as vice president, would have a better shot at moving climate legislation through Congress because of his longstanding relationships and pragmatic approach. Biden also has strong ties to labor unions that are skeptical of ambitious proposals to tackle climate change. Already Biden has suggested Democrats should push for “Green Deal” spending in the next aid package responding to the economic downturn spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Though he is unlikely to endorse policies to significantly curb drilling for oil and natural gas – like a fracking ban – which could alienate supporters in swing states like Pennsylvania.“There’s a lot more that can be done to have the full-scale mobilization of the federal government that is needed to defeat climate change,” said Jamal Raad, former aide to Inslee’s 2020 presidential campaign. “That’s the task at hand here for the next president.”Progressive activists say their overriding priority in 2020 is to defeat Trump. But they warn that antipathy for the president is not enough to win in November. And how Biden engages the left and what concessions he is willing to make could determine the nature of their electoral efforts on his behalf.“Will enough people be willing to volunteer for the nominee? Or send text messages for the nominee? Or overcome the barriers of voter suppression that we know are coming to vote for the nominee,” said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. “That’s what’s at stake.”Epps-Addison echoed many Democratic activists in urging Biden to put a progressive standard-bearer on the ticket with him. Biden has said he would choose a woman as his running mate, an overture to Democrats deeply disappointed that two white men in their 70s emerged from a historically erse and female presidential field.Both Democratic contenders have vowed to actively support whoever becomes the party’s nominee. Yet Biden has so far struggled to re-create the grassroots excitement that has powered Sanders’ presidential bid, with packed rallies and an endless stream of small-dollar donations. Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to criticize his opponent’s record. Asked during the last Democratic debate how he might appeal to Sanders’ supporters if he became the nominee, Biden quipped: “He’s making it hard for me right now.”In spite of Biden’s success in the primary, progressive proposals on healthcare, climate change and student debt remain widely popular among Democratic voters – a point Sanders has made explicitly as he has defended his decision to stay in the primary race. His ideas, the senator asserted, are winning the “ideological” and “generational” debate” –\u0026nbspeven if he is not winning the nomination. Biden may be the eventual nominee, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren, but “tens of millions of people who supported Warren and Sanders nonetheless wanted a president who advocated for bold, progressive policy ideas.”Alexis Confer, executive director of March For Our Lives, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, said the best way for Biden to reach young voters is to address their priorities with a shared sense of urgency.“We see our daily work as fighting the largest epidemic in our country,” Confer said, referring to the scourge of gun violence that claims more than 36,000 American lives each year. But they also view their activism as part of a wider movement for social, racial and economic justice, she added, emphasizing that “people don’t live single-issue lives.”In discussions with Biden’s team, March for Our Lives is advocating for a 10-day waiting period on all firearm purchases, a federal gun licensing program and the creation of an administration role dedicated to combating gun violence.Pro-choice organizations are also eager to see Biden elevate his support for reproductive rights, especially in light of efforts in conservative states to restrict abortions during the coronavirus outbreak.Early in the primary season, Biden abandoned his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion with some exceptions. But he has a shifting voting record on the issue and some advocates have called on him to release a standalone plan outlining his commitment to defending reproductive rights.“Voters need to know that addressing this crisis is top of mind for our next president and that our nominee understands that reproductive freedom is fundamental to achieving meaningful equity in society,” NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.Immigration is a particularly thorny issue for Biden. Throughout the primary season, he has faced fierce criticism from immigration activists over the Obama administration’s deportation policy, which resulted in the removal of roughly three million people. At campaign events and even during Democratic debates, Biden was met with protests and interruptions from activists shouting: “Not one more deportation.”Cristina Jiménez, executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights network, said Biden has work to do to “bridge the trust gap” with Latino voters, a powerful Democratic constituency that tends to be younger. In the primary, many of these voters flocked to Sanders, who proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system.Her group, which jointly endorsed Sanders and Warren, expects to meet with Biden’s team in the coming weeks. In those discussions, they intend to press him to commit to using executive authority to expand programs like Daca, which shields certain immigrants from deportation and to repeal a 1996 law that increased penalties for crossing the border illegally.Biden has acknowledged the “incredible pain” caused by deportation and recently pledged to halt nearly all removals in the first 100 days of his administration, a move activists believes is a testament to their advocacy.Still, many progressives remain skeptical.“Right now it still feels like more of the same,” said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at the immigration services organization RAICES and a former staffer on Sanders’ 2016 campaign. “That’s why we have to keep pushing him.”In a virtual fundraiser on Friday, Biden was optimistic that he could find common ground with the Democrats most leery of his campaign in time to bring the party together in November.“There’s a lot of good ideas they have – I disagree with many of them,” Biden said. But he continued: “There’s lot of significant change that can take place – both structurally and practically – that can bring everybody along.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab8040f6f49cbda8ae5cf716b0aeee1ff54bc24/0_204_3936_2360/master/3936..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b4fc0b8b3a044bdcc32012cea5e68db","title":"ministers seeking to smear civil servants over coronavirus handling","story":"FDA union says ‘cowardly’ briefings show some in government putting self-preservation firstMinisters have been accused of focusing on saving their careers instead of the lives of coronavirus victims by authorising “cowardly and shameful” anonymous briefings against some of the UK’s most senior public officials.Smears by unnamed Downing Street sources against Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, and Public Health England (PHE) executives show that “some within government are still putting self-preservation first”, according to the head of the senior civil servants’ union.It comes amid concern across Whitehall that cabinet ministers and their special advisers are mounting a concerted effort to pass the blame for the UK’s faltering response to the pandemic on to officials.Government sources were quoted this weekend claiming that Sedwill had failed to get a grip of government, PHE officials had not placed enough emphasis on testing and NHS England officials had failed to control personal protective equipment (PPE) supply.In an article for the , Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents the UK’s most senior public servants, said some in government were ignoring the dedication of public servants and instead using them as scapegoats.“As pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of PPE and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government,” said Penman. “Well-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England.“If mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable … While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day.“Right now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers. While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.”A Times article on Saturday quoted an ally of Johnson saying that Sedwill was under scrutiny for failing to control government departments. “He’s more present now but there is a bit of a mystery about where he was in the early days of all this,” the source was quoted as saying.The same article claimed that ministers were blaming PHE officials for an inflexible attitude and insensitivity to public pressure for answers. “What this has exposed is these people’s utter lack of accountability,” a senior official told the newspaper. “It’s not just PHE, it’s a whole world of these bodies that bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something but for the most part entirely out of sight.”In a following article, a “senior figure” told the Sunday Times that NHS England was being blamed by ministers for failing to get a grip on PPE supply.Civil servants have also been angered this weekend by claims that the prime minister is “extremely unlikely” to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, even if she is found to have bullied civil servants across three separate government departments.The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office’s most senior official.Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, is expected to pass on the findings within days.He will decide whether Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan.Rutnam, who resigned after anonymous briefings against him in the media, is suing the government for constructive dismissal after accusing Patel of “swearing and belittling people”.As well as witnessing Patel’s alleged bullying behaviour, Rutnam claimed he was briefed against across the media by sources said to be from either No 10 or friends or allies of Patel. He was accused of being unable to do his job and of being undeserving of his pension, and was compared to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore.Patel has denied the claims.One Whitehall source said: “If Patel is cleared without a thorough inquiry into the many claims of bullying, it will be seen as a whitewash and will heighten mistrust across government.”• The main image on this article was replaced on 7 April 2020 as there was a risk of identifying people unrelated to the content of the article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area covid 19 map","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

A 56-year-old man who lived in Dharavi, India’s largest slum, where almost 1 million people are densely packed together in a 2 sq km area in Mumbai, had tested positive for coronavirus. He died shortly after.It has prompted a scramble by local authorities to halt the virus before it takes hold in this overcrowded, unsanitary enclave, which was the inspiration for Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire.But the prospect of attempting to contain transmission in a place where 10 people often live in a single room, more than 80 people share a public toilet and where many houses do not even have running water is already proving daunting to local officials. So far there are five known cases in Dharavi, while 25 people have been taken into special quarantine facilities and another 3,500 placed under home quarantine.“We are doing everything we can to make sure it does not explode and that there is no community spread, but it is a big challenge to contain this,” said Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner for G-North ward of Mumbai.It appears that the 56-year-old garment worker who was the slum’s first victim had made two trips to the local Lokmanya Tilak municipal general hospital over the course of a week, presenting first with a fever and then severe respiratory problems, before he was tested by doctors. With no foreign travel history, he had not been considered high risk. But on 29 March, he tested positive for the virus and died four days later.There was initial confusion over how this man, who had never been abroad and lived with seven family members in a small flat adjacent to Dharavi, could possibly have contracted the virus. Yet while his family were initially uncooperative, it later emerged he had hosted several men who had attended a religious gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat sect of Islam in Delhi several weeks ago, which has since been linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across India.The response by the authorities was swift. The area where the victim had lived was sealed off and remains so, and his family was taken into quarantine and all those in the building, or who were considered high risk, have been tested. A new 51-bed hospital in the Dharavi area, specifically to treat coronavirus patients, has also been acquired, with eight intensive care beds, though it is feared if the virus takes hold this will not be nearly enough.Other cases in the slum include a 30-year-old woman with no foreign travel history, and authorities are searching for the dozens who attended her birthday party a week ago.“There are already many health issues in Dharavi,” said Dighavkar, who added that one of the main obstacles in tackling the spread of coronavirus was a social stigma that prevented people from coming forward with symptoms.“But we are hopeful that they have good immunity because they have been exposed to many viruses, especially through using the community toilet, so we are hoping that if we find the high-risk contacts and put them in quarantine, we will be able to control it.”Babbu Khan, a municipal councillor in Dharavi, said he feared many more people were already infected and warned that undetected cases could “wreak havoc” in the slum, where the disease was likely to “spread like wildfire”.“For the slum-dwellers it is very difficult to stay safe from a coronavirus-infected neighbour in this incredibly congested slum of Dharavi,” said Khan. “When five people have already tested positive for the virus, there must be many more people around who are already infected. We know that many people carrying the virus remain asymptomatic, but still continue to spread the infection.”Overall Mumbai has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the country and on Monday, three doctors and 26 nurses of Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai tested positive, bringing the total number of cases in the state of Maharashtra to 809.Within Dharavi, fear has already begun to take hold. Mohammad Shafi Alam Shaikh, 53, who trades in school bags and lives in the MP Nagar area of Dharavi along with his wife and four children, said many people were very scared about the “new disease”.“Many of my neighbours are very nervous and staying indoors,” he said. “They are coming out of their homes only to use public toilets. All of them say that it is very difficult to escape the infection in such congested slums. They all are afraid of being infected.”Many mosques in the slum are using their public announcement system to spread awareness about Covid-19. But Shaikh said most of the advised measures for hand-washing and social distancing were an impossibility for the people of Dharavi.“Many people do not have food at home and so in search of provisions and food handouts, people are being forced to stay outside their homes for a long time. At places like ration shops and free food delivery points people are still gathering in big numbers,” said Shaikh. “So we are very afraid of a fast spread of the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda74d598f84abf4e4f682650ea6f7059d43a44b/0_195_4368_2621/master/4368..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a6ee343364cce21bc2aacae7aa7151e","title":"what coronavirus can teach us about hope rebecca solnit","story":"In the midst of fear and isolation, we are learning that profound, positive change is possible. By  Rebecca SolnitDisasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible – extending workers’ rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US – have already happened.The word “crisis” means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word “emergency” comes from “emergence” or “emerge”, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word “catastrophe” comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now – especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties – is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.A disaster (which originally meant “ill-starred”, or “under a bad star”) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of “we” might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you’re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you’re working all the time, especially when it appears you’re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 911, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems – political, economic, social, ecological – in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what’s strong, what’s weak, what’s corrupt, what matters and what doesn’t.I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it’s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo – it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it’s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life – as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power – as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights – and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).Disaster scholars use the term “elite panic” to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe “panic” and “looting” in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it’s wise to move rapidly from danger sometimes it’s altruistic to gather supplies to share.Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a “shoot to kill” proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans’s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers’ levees had failed the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush’s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: “He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn’t care less about people’s lives. They’re worried about maintaining their profitability.” (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed ine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: “please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms \u0026amp your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.” The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: “The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.” (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them – this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one’s whims. “This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,” wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US – a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: “Let us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.” We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: “We are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.”When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff – medicine, medical equipment – made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.“Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,” Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all – and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe’s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible – housing the homeless, for example – have come to pass in some places.But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011’s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the inidual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There’s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.There’s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it’s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells – for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It’s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid – full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often ide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be ided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one’s own interior life and the suffering around us – and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed – well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: “Provide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.” It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcac2a6f8a716a0e4c7e2ae689aed23c2288b30/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf598c537a604f6bd21057f62f33c75a","title":"covid 19 what if im immunocompromised","story":"Hannah Devlin speaks to Dr Jenna Macciochi about how our immune systems fight off infections such as coronavirus, and – as per lots of your questions – what happens if we’re immunocompromised"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

There are seven in the west, three in the mid-west and two in the midlands and north-west, as well as single outbreaks in both the south-east and the south.There are also a growing number of outbreaks in residential institutions, where 26 clusters have now been reported 18 are in the east.The Health Information and Quality Authority, which inspects nursing homes, said yesterday it had opened an infection prevention and control hub to provide support and advice to social care services tackling Covid-19.The hub, which provides guidance on managing outbreaks of the virus, is available to providers and staff of nursing homes, residential centres for people with a disability, special-care units and Tusla children’s residential settings.“We know that providers and staff are working extremely hard to provide safe care to residents,” said Hiqa’s chief inspector of social services, Mary Dunnion. “In supporting residential services since the Covid-19 public health emergency began, it became apparent that additional support was required in the area of infection prevention and control. “I am confident that by working together we can support and protect vulnerable adults and children living in residential centres. I hope that this service will be of benefit to both providers and staff.”The Government announced a series of measures on Saturday to assist nursing homes cope with the coronavirus outbreak, including financial support of up to €72 million, the appointment of national and regional infection-control teams and temperature screening of staff twice a day.The nursing home sector welcomed “that the focus has shifted to nursing homes now where our most vulnerable are living”, after months of planning by the Government for the hospital system and wider society.Clusters The number of clusters in hospitals has increased from 37 to 43 in the latest daily epidemiological report from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. In addition, there are 14 outbreaks in community hospitals or long-stay units.A Covid-19 cluster is defined as two laboratory-positive cases in an institution.It shows a total of 1,163 healthcare workers have become infected with coronavirus foreign travel accounts for only 101 of these cases.Over-65s account for almost half of all cases and more than 90 per cent of deaths. In contrast, under-25s account for less than 4 per cent of cases and no deaths.The oldest person to be diagnosed with Covid-19 was 99 years old and the youngest was a baby in the first year of life.The report shows Ireland has imported cases from 26 other countries, though the numbers relating to the main source countries such as the UK, Austria, Italy and Spain appear to have stabilised. No case is associated with travel from China, the country where the epidemic started.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Latest figure brings total number of deaths in the region to 73New modelling data claims Covid-19 infections peaked in Ireland on April 4thJudges decide not to make formal declaration on human rights due to law changeFull moon will coincide with its closest approach to the EarthAnalysis has found quality of some reporting is poor and recommendations questionableHiqa opens infection prevention and control hub to advise social care servicesEileen O\u0026rsquoHalloran suing PSNI and Ministry of Defence over alleged state collusionNew leader says the four largest parties should form strong governmentWednesday forecast to be mild, bright and dry over most of IrelandResearch finds the population has suffered a significant decline in wellbeing, with high levels of stress and anxietySouth Dublin home has seven infected residents and 20-plus staff sick or in self-isolationCovid-19 fatalities in Ireland are replicating gender patterns across the worldFamily of coronavirus victim says pandemic\u0027s impact on grief is often overlookedStaying in pandemic mode for three months means each GP will not see one person with a life-altering condition\u0026lsquoFour legs\u0026rsquo and stable majority needed, says Regional Independent group Denis NaughtenTalks under way to break impasse over moving 600 consultants to public system\u0026lsquoThe people on the front line need them more than I do\u0026rsquoChildcare scheme for health workers being discussed as 16 more patients dieStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222995.1586247631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alan kelly labour party unlikely to enter coalition government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Alan Kelly said he was disappointed the Green Party was not more willing to enter government.

Photograph: Nick BradshawAs the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic became all too apparent last month, Esther Waters knew she would have an enormous challenge on her hands to keep her 82-year-old mother safe.Esther’s mother, Esther Duggan, has dementia and until recent days was living alone in Dundrum, south Dublin.Her daughter had been visiting her for a couple of hours a day each day throughout March, making sure she had company and everything she needed, but then the crisis deepened and older people were told to cocoon while everyone else was asked to keep their distance.Understandably, Esther senior struggled to comprehend the new rules and “still went out for her walks to the shops and even gate-crashed Mass. I saw her in the empty church on the live feed,” her daughter told The .Despite trying over many days, Ms Waters said she “couldn’t break through to her about isolation and protecting others. She was adamant that, despite all attempts from friends and family, she wouldn’t come to my house only 4km away in Blackrock. ”After multiple attempts “to relocate my lovely mother, I turned to the Garda in Dundrum and told them I was going to shoot her – joking of course,” Ms Waters continued.Immediately gardaí took control of the situation and not because of the firearm threat.“I didn’t even have to ask: Sgt Ivan and community garda Linda were familiar with the situation and jumped into action,” she said. “They had a quick chat with me in the station car park, assured me that they’d get her to move and asked me to lead the way to her house immediately.”The two gardaí spent over an hour and a half “gently coaxing her out into my car”.While they were doing that, Ms Waters packed an overnight bag for her mother and included familiar bits and pieces from her bedroom.“At my house Garda Linda took Mum into the self-contained room and unpacked the bag with Mum, arranging her radio, photographs, toiletries etc. Gda Ivan spent his time reassuring my children and, I suspect, checking out that he was actually delivering Mum into a safe environment. He showed them videos on his phone and instructed them on handwashing techniques.”PhotographsMs Waters estimated that the gardaí spent at least another 90 minutes settling her mother in.“You would think that they had already gone beyond the call of duty: but no, they followed up with calls the next morning asking for photographs of Mum and personal details. They are putting her image out to gardaí in case she wanders from her unfamiliar surroundings,” Ms Waters continued.“Again, you’d think they’d gone beyond the call of duty: but no, they both arrived with a bouquet of flowers for Mum and cookies for the kids at around 8pm on night two of Mum’s relocation.”She said she could not praise the two gardaí highly enough for their “compassion, consideration, patience, tenderness and, as if they had nothing else to do, they took their time”.“There was no sense of rushing – or of Mum being an inconvenience to them. They acted as if it was their own mum. I am completely in awe and forever grateful.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222304.1586192529!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it is a scary time the nursing homes battling coronavirus clusters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe sharp rise in cluster outbreaks has caused alarm in nursing homes which have managed to avoid any coronavirus infections. Photograph: John StillwellPATwo Dublin nursing homes battling clusters of coronavirus infections have called for the additional staff, protective equipment and resources promised to the sector to stem the outbreaks.The nursing homes, which have asked not to be identified in order to protect residents and staff, are among the 57 residential-care homes with outbreaks, a sixfold increase in just over a week.One of the homes, on the south side of Dublin, has seven residents and a number of staff who have tested positive for Covid-19. The facility is down more than 20 staff who are on sick leave or self-isolating because of their exposure to the virus and is struggling to find replacement staff.The outbreak has resulted in senior managers who would not typically be working on the floor of the nursing home now doing so to fill the gaps left in staffing.A senior manager at the nursing home said that while the Health Service Executive had provided additional personal protective equipment (PPE), the real requirement was for additional staff.All staff currently in self-isolation and on sick leave were being checked on every day and the nursing home was “charting for their planned return to work”, a spokesman said.Healthcare demands“There is a relatively small pool of suitable people available considering the demand being imposed nationally by the acute system, public and community nursing facilities and finally the private nursing homes, so we are being realistic in our expectations as to what the system will be able to provide in real terms,” the manager said in a statement released to The .The other nursing home, in north Dublin, has been “battling” to contain the spread of the virus since last month, a spokesman for the facility said. He declined to disclose the number of Covid-19-infected residents or staff at the facility or the number who are self-isolating because of exposure. He said the HSE had instructed the home that only State health officials were allowed to release details of case numbers publicly.“What would greatly help is the immediate supply of PPE and extra resources which the Government spoke about,” said the spokesman.The outbreak in nursing homes is concentrated in the east of the country which has 41 of the 57 Covid-19 clusters, followed by seven in the west and three in the midwest.Infection fearsThe sharp increase in the number of outbreaks has caused alarm in nursing homes which have managed to avoid any coronavirus infections. “I am terrified because every day you get up, the number of clusters is increasing,” said Lorraine (not real name) who manages a nursing home in the midlands with up to 50 residents and 40 staff.The manager, who did not want her nursing home identified out of concern for her residents and staff, said they received just four items of PPE in one delivery from the HSE last week, though they have received sufficient equipment since then to cope with an outbreak.“It is a massive, massive worry. On the outside you are portraying it like everything is okay and trying to put a brave face on it, but underneath you are stressed out. You are like the swan – you are graceful on top and underneath you are going mental,” she said.“It is just the unknown. We don’t know what is going to happen. Will we be able to open the doors before December? It is a scary time.”Lorraine said that the home has had to switch off RTÉ’s Six One News in the home’s day room – a daily watching ritual for many of her residents – and removed copies of a daily newspaper one day because they had news stories about the coronavirus pandemic affecting nursing homes and older people.“They love the six o’clock news – that is their thing and we have it on – but it is obviously doom and gloom and if we feel it is getting a bit dramatic, we do turn it off.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221960.1586170700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s just stuff doctor leaves all possessions behind in australia to return to work in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Marianne Hennigan at Dublin Airport on Saturday. Photograph: Ireland’s CallThe world has changed completely since Dr Marianne Hennigan started a four-week holiday in New Zealand in mid-March. Then, governments were waking up to the reality of Covid-19, but it was still a disease mostly confined to China and Europe and not to Australia and New Zealand.Nobody expected the raft of restrictions which would shut down the world in the space of a few weeks. Within a week of her arrival in New Zealand, the bus tour was cancelled and she, along with others on the tour, was forced to self-isolate in Auckland. Dr Hennigan (31), originally from Deansgrange, Co Dublin, was working in Perth at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a locum doctor in emergency medicine. Like hundreds of other Irish newly-qualified doctors she found the opportunities and the climate in Perth agreeable and had spent three years there. Her flight back to Perth from Auckland was abruptly cancelled with no replacement available. In this hiatus, she made up her mind not to go back to Perth at all, but leave her car and her possessions there and return to Ireland to work. “In the end of the day it’s just stuff. I really enjoyed working in Perth,” she said. “It was lovely, the biggest thing that I regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to any of my friends when I left. I’m sure I will at some point. Unfortunately, none of us really expected what was going to happen.” Her marathon flight home, first to Doha in Qatar, and then to Ireland was facilitated by the Ireland’s Call Initiative which is not to be confused with On Call for Ireland, the HSE call for healthcare professionals, students and volunteers to help tackle coronavirus in Ireland. The Ireland’s Call Initiative was set up by businessman Neil Sands as a philanthropic enterprise to bring doctors and nurses home from abroad and to pay for their flights and accommodation in self-isolation for a fortnight. Ireland’s Call hopes to bring home 100 Irish medics from abroad in the coming months. She is the first to be repatriated under the initiative and one of more than 50,000 people who have offered their services to the HSE since last month. “We are not the real heroes,” she stressed. “The real heroes are the people who have been there from day one. We are the reinforcements. “I am delighted to be home. I was particularly happy to see my mum at the airport. It is just a relief to be coming home for the foreseeable future and that I won’t be stuck. “The main fear is that working in ICU, where it is high-risk, if I were to get sick, my family wouldn’t be able to come out to see me in Perth. At this time you want to be in proximity with your family and around Irish people.” She will need the next fortnight to register for and find work. Her experience in emergency respiratory medicine in Perth will be invaluable for her and for the HSE as it seeks to cope with the pandemic. There will be other business to attend to and making a will is something she feels is necessary given the risks involved. “I think everybody is fearful at this point in time when you see young healthcare workers getting sick and dying,” she said. “It is obvious that I didn’t intend to do it at this stage of my life. It is our profession and it is something that I want to help out. I would much rather be in the front line helping out than being stuck in another country in an Airbnb.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222505.1586203564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no point in coalition with fg ff without two smaller groupings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten: the Regional Independent group is only interested in “forming a government that can last five years”. Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyRoscommon TD Denis Naughten is a member of the nine-strong Regional Independent group of TDs which is seen as the most likely grouping to join a coalition involving the two Civil War parties.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael met again on Monday as they work towards publishing a framework document that will outline how a coalition between the two will operate. They will meet again this week to finalise the document, which is understood to raise the prospect of much stronger State intervention in the health, housing and childcare sectors.The Covid-19 crisis has seen the State temporarily take over large aspects of the private health system and pay the wages of childcare workers. One source said that, on childcare, it would be hard for a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael government to undo what has been done in recent weeks, but added that such details have not yet been discussed between the parties.Both Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar hope to approach smaller parties and groupings when the framework document is finished in an attempt to build a broader coalition.Covid-19 crisisBetween them, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have 72 seats, which is eight short of a Dáil majority. Mr Varadkar has said a third party is needed and Mr Martin has spoken of such a government needing a strong majority to deal with the fallout from the Covid-19 crisis. However, the Green Party is continuing to advocate for a national unity government and Labour has thus far stuck to its position that it wants to go into opposition. The Social Democrats have said their policies would be incompatible with a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael combination. It has led some in the Civil War parties to suggest that a government may need to be formed with the support of Independents alone, but Mr Naughten said “There is no point in participating in that type of government.”The former minister for communications has said the regional group has been clear it is only interested in “forming a government that can last five years”.“Our view from day one has always been that there needs to be four legs to this stool – two big parties and two small parties or groups.” ‘Bully any party’He said a new government “not only has to have a majority, it has to have a stable one”. “We don’t believe that is possible having a bare majority of 80 or 81,” he said. “We believe there is a need for another party to be involved.”Mr Varadkar on Monday said “we need a third party, a third pillar as part of that government”, adding: “It’s not our view that we should try to bully any party into government.”Meanwhile, the Dáil will sit in the Convention Centre in Dublin if a vote needs to be taken to elect a new taoiseach.The business committee of the Dáil made the decision at a meeting on Monday where it was also decided that another restricted sitting would take place on April 16th. The restricted Leister House sitting – with a set number of TDs from various parties and groupings only allowed attend – will see the Taoiseach, Minister for Health and Minister for Finance take questions.The move to the Convention Centre would allow all 160 TDs attend the Dáil sitting and vote for taoiseach while respecting rules on social distancing.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222993.1586247179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sunny weather expected with temperatures to reach 18 degrees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClarinbridge, Co Galway, on Tuesday morning.

Photograph: Miguel CaleroEPAA supermoon will be visible in Irish skies from early on Wednesday morning as it makes its closest approach to the Earth. A full moon is due at 3.35am and will be visible both in morning and evening skies for the coming days. This week’s moon is know as a supermoon because the full m oon coincides with the perigee or its closest approach to Earth. The moon’s orbit of the Earth is slightly elliptical rather than circular, meaning it is closer at certain times. The moon has been large and almost full already this week and if people can’t wait until tomorrow it will appear spectacularly large and bright in skies on Tuesday night from about 8.30pm. However, technically speaking, it won’t be full or a supermoon until early on Wednesday morning. It will continue large and bright in our skies on Wednesday and Thursday night before gradually appearing smaller and less full. On Wednesday morning the moon will be 356,000 kilometres away from the Earth. At apogee, or furthest point away, it is 405,000 kilometres away. Hence the supermoon will be between 12 and 14 per cent bigger than normal. The forecast over the coming days is for mostly dry weather so there is a good chance of seeing the supermoon in all its glory. This particular moon is called the pink supermoon as it corresponds with the spring flowering of the moss pink in North America. The moon before Easter is known in the Christian calendar as the Paschal full moon. The moveable feast of Easter is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox which occurs on March 21st. On Good Friday morning, April 10th, there will be a conjunction in the morning skies of the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, all of which will be clearly visible to the naked eye. The three bright planets will appear in a line from the horizon.

Photograph:  Athit PerawongmethaAFP via GettyIf the world didn’t already have a musical about an eccentric Thai king, now would be the time to write one.With much of the globe in coronavirus lockdown, Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand is commuting back and forth between his homeland and Germany in a bid to secure the lead role in The Playboy King \u0026amp I.On Monday the 67-year-old monarch was expected to preside over celebrations to mark the establishment of the current Chakri family royal dynasty in 1782.\u0026nbspBut it was just a flying visit for the controversial ruler, and he was expected to fly afterwards back to Bavaria where he has been a welcome distraction for Germans in the coronavirus crisis.But even before his 18,000km return trip to Thailand, many Germans have wondered why the Thai king appears to be living in a very different lockdown to them.While most hotels in Germany have closed, in line with coronavirus restrictions, the king was given special permission to self-isolate with a 20-member harem in the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Bavaria’s Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a winter sport resort.While Germans are allowed outdoors once a day for a short walk or exercise, the king is jetting around the country on short-hop flights: to Baden-Baden, Dresden, Leipzig and Hanover. Using a full-sized Boeing 737-800 just for himself, the king is reportedly a fan of “touch-and-go” flights in which the plane takes off again after only a brief touch-down. German aviation experts believe the king is flying the plane himself to keep up the minimum number of flight hours required for a pilot’s licence.For years as crown prince, Thais have looked on in amazement and amusement at his antics, in particular his push to suppress an image of himself in a crop top with fake tattoos, enjoying an ice cream in a German shopping centre.Six-hour ceremony He was crowned king last May, nearly three years after his father’s death, in a six-hour ceremony that cost a reported €29 million. Since becoming king, the married monarch took on a royal consort but stripped her of the title again months later for “disrespectful” behaviour to the queen.His current wife, a former bodyguard, is his fourth. He married his first wife, a cousin, in 1977 and they had a daughter together. At the same time he had four sons and a daughter with a mistress but when he filed for orce, in 1993, he accused his wife of adultery. When the subsequent marriage to his mistress collapsed after two years, she fled to the UK and he accused her, too, of adultery.He kept secret his third marriage, to a waitress, until she gave birth to their son in 2005. At the time the prince said he was anxious to settle down and made his poodle, Foo-Foo, a chief marshall in the Thai air force.A former US ambassador, in a leaked cable from 2007, recalled how, during a musical interlude at a state banquet, the chief marshall, wearing full evening wear, “jumped up on to the head table and began lapping from the guests’ water glasses, including my own”.\u0026nbspFoo-Foo died in 2015 and was given a full-on four-day Buddhist funeral.Though a constitutional monarch, the king’s estimated fortune of up to €100 billion, combined with stringent lèse-majesté rules, have kept him largely insulated from criticism or financial concerns.But with Thailand registering 2,220 confirmed cases of coronavirus on Monday, and 26 deaths, reports of the king’s colourful life in Bavaria have seen a Twitter hashtag trending among his subjects: #whydoweneedaking. \u0026nbspEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Taliban pull out of prisoner swap talks with Afghan governmentBoris Johnson is not on a ventilator, insists No 10, as he battles coronavirus in intensive care - latest newsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson \u0026#39stable and in good spirits\u0026#39 as Dominic Raab takes the reinsCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: When will travel restrictions be lifted?

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine could ready autumn scientists suggest","story":"A coronavirus vaccine could be ready as early as the autumn,  an Oxford University research team has said.The “best case scenario” suggests scientists are aiming for a much more ambitious rollout than previously thought.However, the Oxford team, one of many working around the clock to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, warned that it was still trying to source funding for manufacturing the potential drug.The Oxford trial, a collaboration between the University’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams, has recruited more than 500 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 who will begin the tests this month following an “overwhelming” response.Asked about the timescale for a potential roll-out, if successful, the researchers said: “The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020 we have the results about the effectiveness of the vaccine from a phase III trial and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine.”They acknowledged, however, that such “best-case timeframes” were “highly ambitious” and subject to change. They added: “We are currently trying to source additional funding for the scale-up of vaccine manufacturing to produce enough doses for deployment.”Participants will remain in the trial for six months, attending appointments at the Oxford Vaccine Centre for screening, vaccination with either the new COVID-19 vaccine or a control injection, and blood tests. The team warned that if the peak of disease transmission arrives before the vaccine is ready for trials, the studies will be “challenging”. “If virus transmission has stopped, then it is impossible to assess whether the vaccine can prevent disease,” they said.“At the moment it is not possible to identify who has already been infected, and if the virus is spreading quickly throughout the population it might be difficult to find unexposed people to take part in the trial. Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus.”Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"food can eaten six months best before date finds","story":"Food can be eaten for up to six months after the best-before date and weeks beyond its use-by date, according to consumer watchdogs.The research also found that ignoring some of the recommendations on best-before and use-by labels could save millions of tonnes of produce from being unnecessarily sent to landfill sites.However, while the rules can be bent for some products, those on fresh and processed meat, poultry and fish should not, said Which? Similarly, anyone classed as vulnerable and with underlying health conditions should also adhere to the dates on the labels, it added.The consumer champions enlisted microbiologist and food safety consultant Dr Slim Dinsdale to look at the best-before or use-by dates on popular products. The government advice is that food is safe to eat past its best-before date but not after a use-by date.But Dr Dinsdale, of Food Safety Experts, said: We are far too ready to throw foods away because we go by the use-by date, when, in fact, they\u0027re absolutely fine to eat beyond this point.Dr Dinsdale said eggs could be eaten one week after their best-before date if kept at room temperature and for one month beyond it when refrigerated, as long as they have the red lion safety stamp. Opened milk can be consumed up to a week after the use-by date for opened or two weeks unopened. Long-life, nut, soya and oat \u0027milks\u0027 follow the same rules as cows\u0027 milk.Hard cheese can be eaten three months after the best-before date or until mould growth becomes unacceptable - mould can be sliced off and thrown away. Soft cheese can be consumed up to a week after the use-by date if pasteurised. Those bought in markets or cheesemongers may not be pasteurised so should be eaten by the use-by date.Butter lasts up to six months, he added, after the best-before date if refrigerated. Low-fat spreads are OK up to two to three weeks after the use-by date.Fruit and vegetables, meanwhile, can apparently be used for weeks after its purchase if they look fine, albeit with some exceptions. Prepared salads that are unopened should be eaten no more than one week after the use-by date, because of the potential for the growth of listeria. The bits of potatoes which turn green should be cut out because that is the result of the chemical activity of solanine, which is toxic in excess.Brian Smith, of Booth Smith Food Technology, confirmed that the food industry was cautious when setting use-by dates to protect people, but warned consumers not to take risks with fresh food.The food industry bills in a good margin of safety when they carry out their testing on food to give their consumers a safe margin, Smith said. The guide to the sell-by date is: look at it, but don\u0027t be ruled by it. If it looks and tastes bad, it is likely to be bad. But with fresh food or perishables it is best not to exceed the best-before date.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/03/TELEMMGLPICT000229001046_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDQVK81QMLSkr-IuGRMUJHCVB-e_nxfetMVMJL5pqsDA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"has coronavirus taught remainers value older generation","story":"Ours is a very self-obsessed, abrasive cultureWhy are we putting the economy on hold, suspending liberty, destroying hundreds of businesses, ripping up plans and trashing the futures of so many young people, for the sake of prolonging the lives of a few thousand people who, if the statistics are to be believed, would probably have died at some point over the next 12 months to five years, even without contracting the coronavirus?It’s not a nice way of phrasing it, but if you take a step back, that is what this amounts to. Now clearly, not all those at risk of Covid-19 fall into the category of old or infirm — there are examples of young and apparently fit people succumbing to its horror — but the overwhelming majority, whether dying of or with it, are. Since when did we start caring so much?The arrival of the pandemic has unleashed some nasty things beyond the disease itself on these shores. The UK, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s assertions, has been slowly drifting away from being the home of liberty for some time — the Brexit debate, which split the public worryingly close to evenly down the middle, suggested far more people here are on board with unaccountable big state power than we would have ever thought possible.Since the lockdown began, that curtain-twitching streak has been given a new vehicle through which to express itself, with a vociferous cohort, driven, shamefully, by swathes of the media, actively encouraging the suspension of liberty at every turn in order to ‘save lives’. Indeed, no encroachment by the authorities is too great for some, with people praising the harassment of law-abiding citizens, those who had previously labeled their government ‘fascist’ slamming it for not imposing a police state fast enough, and one particularly bombastic public figure calling those with the gall to venture outside on a summer’s day ‘traitors.’ And all this in the pursuit of ‘saving lives.’It’s odd that we now seem so desperate to protect these lives at all cost. But a matter of months ago, this same country openly entertained voices (many of whom now chatter about ‘protecting the NHS’) who opined that the 2016 EU referendum should be rerun, because the elderly folk who had voted for Brexit were either dead or dying — so their wishes, having been frustrated and delayed, could now be conveniently ignored. For years now, we have heard about how the majority of the elderly of this nation, for the sin of not voting the right way, are racists and bigots. Not only that, but they are also drains on the system — representing the ‘ticking time bomb’ of social care, sitting atop gold plated pensions, and clogging up the housing supply for the restless young by refusing to stop breathing. Deaths in countries under lockdownOf the unholy trinity of sins you can commit today, being old sits alongside being white and male as one of the traits you cannot help having, but for which you are fair game to go after. It can be a lonely, isolating experience, being on the receiving end of a cultural upheaval such as the one we have been undergoing. And, indeed, loneliness is one of the key issues affecting the elderly today.According to Age UK, over 2 million elderly people live alone in the UK, with hundreds of thousands saying they can go months without seeing or speaking to a friend or relative. Many experience feelings of loneliness or depression, and frankly, who can blame them? Add to that the sense that other segments of society blames you for its ills, and you realise that, at times, the physical aging part of being old might not even be the worst thing.Ours is a very self-obsessed, abrasive culture. And in so many ways, the response to the coronavirus — the angry demands, the blaming, the fear — is a continuation of it. But the fact that we are prepared to go to such lengths to protect lives we have so roundly treated with contempt for the past few years is a positive sign. People, faced with the mortality not just of themselves, but of elderly friends, relatives and neighbours, and unable to spend any time with them face to face, are volunteering in their thousands, making phone calls, helping with deliveries, and doing what they can to end the social isolation of the elderly, at the very moment their physical isolation has been enforced.One can only hope that this newfound appreciation for them lasts beyond the lockdown. To get the measure of a nation, we must look to how it treats its elders and its most vulnerable. For too long, we have treated ours poorly. It should not have taken a pandemic that relentlessly targeted them for us to realise this — but now we have, it would be wickedness to forget it again.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The new law, she said, would give the authorities possibilities which are at least close to those available to other countries.The announcement came after Stefan Löfven, Sweden\u0027s prime minister, on Friday warned that the coming weeks would see a steady increase in the number of people dying as a result of the virus.We are going to count the dead in their thousands, he told newspaper Dagens Nyheter. We may as well prepare ourselves for that.Sweden\u0027s public health agency on Monday announced 22 new people died on Sunday from the virus, taking the total to 499.  At 49 per million people, this is significantly above the 33 deaths per million and 11 deaths per million seen in neighbouring Denmark and Norway, where unlike in Sweden, schools, kindergartens, bars and restaurants have been closed.However, on Monday the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare said that as many as a fifth of the country\u0027s intensive care places currently remained unfilled.Even in Stockholm, the centre of the epidemic, the regional health chief Björn Eriksson on Monday said there were plenty of spaces both for intensive care and outpatient care.The Swedish army has also erected field hospitals in outside major cities, with the biggest at the Stockholmsmassan conference centre, opening on Monday.The new proposal, which the government gave Sweden\u0027s agencies just 24 hours to respond to during a sped-up consultation phase, will, among other measures, give government authorities special powers to shut down events, institutions, or places where they believe there is a risk of infection, without requiring them to consult parliament.It will also allow the government and its agencies to overrule the regional health authorities to that medicine and medical equipment can be moved to wherever it is most needed.The law, like similar legislation in neighbouring Denmark and Norway, comes with a sunset clause, with the new powers expiring automatically on June 30.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up lady gaga curates","story":"Throughout these trying times, the world must remain entertained.

All but 11 countries, as of April 6, have banned British travellers over coronavirus. And what about those with holidays already booked for later in the year? Should you cancel or wait and see if the situation improves? The Daily \u0027s Chief Consumer and Culture Editor, Nick Trend, will be answering your  travel and holiday questions at 1 p.m. (BST) today. Leave your questions in the comments section at the bottom of this article.

We\u0027ve been flooded with queries but there will be lots more travel Q\u0026ampAs in the near future. reader Marian says: Two weeks before the Coronavirus restrictions I booked and paid a substantial down payment on a South America holiday booked with Trailfinders. We are due to fly to Lima on 27th June and we will also visit Brazil.I am due to pay the balance next week on 15th April. Trailfinders have sent me generic emails asking people not to contact them about departures in MayJune  at this stage. The email also said that cancellations after 15th May would be subject to cancellation policy as flights will have resumed.I am reluctant to pay the balance because of the uncertainty and the risk of travelling. Even if travel restrictions are relaxed and flights resume there must still be a substantial risk from the virus. Also I do not know whether my group travel insurance will cover us if we contract the virus.So I am concerned that if I do not pay the balance I will lose the substantial down payment. But if I pay the balance and in June the virus still poses a risk and we decide not to go then I will lose the full price of the holiday, if travel restrictions are lifted and flights resume I will be unable to claim on insurance.And here\u0027s Nick\u0027s final answer for today: This is a tricky situation. Trialfinders is an extremely reliable company and I would trust what they say. I would contact them three or four days before the rest of the payment is due and discuss your options then.Telegraph reader Shri says: We have booked tickets to Barcelona for Easter holidays through Iberia (British Airways concern). Their customer care executive in clear terms told me that they will refund if there is foreign travel advice against Spain. I tried to contact them after the advisory and they refused to refund, instead offering vouchers, which are not useful for us as it was a one time trip for us to BarcelonaSpain booked and our Visas will also be not valid after 6 monthsNow I can\u0027t contact them via phone(they run a automated voucher message and hang up) or email (as there is none provided on their website)How can I get the refunds on these tickets? Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:You mention visas, which suggests you are not British citizens and I don’t know where you bought your tickets. If you bought them in the UK, you are legally entitled to a cash refund and you should continue to press for that, though it may take some time and you may feel that accepting a voucher may be a better option. If you bought them or were planning to travel from another country, your rights may be different.A very tricky one here. Katherine Mills says: My 18 year old daughter has booked a weeks holiday to Zante, departing on the 29th June, with 11 of her friends.They have the last instalment to be paid at the end of this month should they pay it?My daughter had travel insurance at the time of booking, some of the group didn’t take travel insurance out until a month or so after booking the holiday. Will they need to claim on their travel insurance to get their money back, if they are unable to go?  If they do, will it make a difference as to when u purchased your travel insurance?From Nick: Tricky - if they don’t pay then they will lose their holiday. Travel insurance will make no difference in that situation. If they pay they can either go on the holiday, or , if it is cancelled, claim a refund. Make sure that the operator has an Atol bond to ensure the booking is financially  secure if it goes out of business in the meantime.An anonymous one here: I am due to fly out from LHR to Havana, Cuba via Madrid on the 25th May 2020, then from Havana to New York on the 3rd June, finally New York to London on the 6th June. British Airways have said that as we are due to fly to Madrid, am I able to receive a credit voucher to use within 12 months of departure. The flight itself, however, hasn’t been cancelled according to Sky Scanner. Am I able to have a refund instead of a credit voucher?  Are airlines able to withdraw the offer of a credit note if the ban is lifted later but before the date of travel?Nick says: You are only entitled to a refund if the flight is cancelled. I suppose in theory the airline could withdraw its offer, but it seems unlikely - BA has been very flexible in allowing changes to flights due to depart before the end of May.This one comes from  John Lavendar who is currently in South Africa. John says: We are presently stranded in South Africa, under a lockdown similar to that in the UK but more rigid. The UK government is talking about \u0027rescue flights\u0027 but I suspect they will be of use only to those already in J\u0027burg or Cape Town. We are hundreds of miles from those places. We are comfortable enough and happy to sit it out until commercial flights are resumed, but our home is in the Isle of Man, which presently has closed its \u0027borders\u0027 with the UK. We are concerned that when, eventually, we can fly from SA that we might get to London with no prospect of going on to the Isle of Man. How do you think that \u0027transit\u0027 airline passengers (albeit \u0027delayed transit\u0027 passengers) will be handled by the UK authorities?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:I’m afraid there are several imponderables in your question which can’t be answered until the situation becomes clearer.I would keep in touch with the authorities on the Isle of Man - they will have a line of communication with the UK government and should be able to give you some guidance when the lockdowns are relaxed.Via email, Kim Hill says: We have been visiting the UK and now wish to drive in our car back to our main residence, which is in Spain. I know France is allowing travel in France to get to a main residence, but what if that main residence is not in France? Are the French authorities allowing travel through and across France to get to the Spanish border?Nick: I assume so, but you should check with the French embassy in London and also remember that whatever the official position is, you may find inidual gendarmes take a different view.Shrddha Shah says: My parents are in India at the moment since January and they are due to return in May they want to come back to London, what do you think they should do? I don’t know where’s safer for them, my Mum has asthma diabetes and high BP I don’t know what advice to give them, I don’t know if they’re safe in Gujarat, Ahmedabad, or better home?Nick: I think your parents should consult a doctor in Gujurat and take advice from him or her. They will be in a much better position to evaluate the risk to your parents’ health.Looking ahead, Claire Templeton says: When do you think it likely that airlines will announce flight cancellations for May? And when will government advice on travel be extended to May? Many are frustrated as they know they won’t be able to travel but can’t get a refund of Air bnb accommodation as policies don’t allow for ‘travel advisories’ and require evidence that overlaps with travel dates.The Foreign Office has just extended its advice against all but essential travel overseas indefinitely, but may rescind it at any time after April 15. I imagine most airlines will be taking a decision about May in the next couple of weeks. BA and Ryanair have both said or implied that it is unlikely they will operate much of a service before June.Andrew Linelll says: I have just returned a week early from a holiday in St Lucia. I have been unable to identify any government advice for travellers returning to the UK. Should we (a) self- isolate and if so, for how long? Or (b) simply follow social-distancing and work from home advice?Nick: There is no specific advice for travellers returning to the UK  without symptoms, so you should remain at home and stick to the current government guidelines on social distancing.One more via email. An anonymous reader says: How about people who’ve finally managed to get flights back into the country. How do they travel from the airport in London to say their home in Manchester? Can they use public transport?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say: Yes. Foreign Office advice is for all British citizens to return to the UK, so obviously they need to return home once they arrive back at the airport. Although much more limited than usual, trains, tubes and some domestic flights are still operating, so someone would be able to travel back from a London airport to Manchester by public transport.Another question here via email.  reader David Norris asks: My wife lives in south-west France, can I drive there to see her?Nick: As I understand it, you would have a hard time justifying this unless she were ill or in need of care. It would be against FCO guidelines to leave the country and against government rules on driving within the UK. You also might face questions en-route by the French police. Eurotunnel, which is offering a limited service is defining travel to France as essential only for those whose main residence is in France or who have to work there.Our next question comes from Kim Hill via email. Kim asks:We have been visiting the UK and now wish to drive in our car back to our main residence, which is in Spain. I know France is allowing travel in France to get to a main residence, but what if that main residence is not in France? Are the French authorities allowing travel through and across France to get to the Spanish border?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:I assume so, but you should check with the French embassy in London and also remember that whatever the official position is, you may find inidual gendarmes take a different view. My son-in-law has booked a ten day holiday through Sykes Holiday Cottages over Easter for four adults and two children in Tomintoul, Scotland.  My wife and myself are part of the party and as we fall into the vulnerable age group we are concerned about making this journey. My daughter is also an essential worker during this crisis.  Our plan, therefore, is to cancel the holiday but Sykes Holiday Cottages say it is a non-cancellation booking. My son in law paid via debit card. Is there any way we can reclaim this cost?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:I’m confused about this because you are not allowed to travel over Easter. And Sykes should already have cancelled the booking and be offering a refund or a postponement. I would get your son-in-law to check the website or contact Sykes as a matter of urgency.Our next question comes from Alex Woolley via email. Alex asks: We are due to travel to northern Italy on June 27 on a holiday of a life time all by rail, through Great Rail Journeys. We have paid £1200 deposit. The balance is due on the April 24. (Approx £7k). Should we be paying the balance in light of the current situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.This is a tricky situation which many people are facing (see my answer to the previous question). If you would feel happier postponing the trip, then I would definitely talk to GRJ and see if you can rebook for next year. If you can’t then wait and see what the situation is looking like in a week or ten days time - things may seem more certain by then.My holiday booked with Emirates Holidays has been cancelled due to coronavirus. As I explained to Emirates Holidays I am self-employed with no idea when I will next be in a job and unlikely to find out anytime soon. I contacted the service desk for a refund and (after over 70 frustrating minutes on hold) I was told to contact my travel insurance. Claiming on my insurance, if the claim is approved, will cost me policy excess charges and increase my premiums not to mention considerable inconvenience and further delay. This is disgraceful service from a supposedly ABTA AND ATOL agent. While I understand the situation is unprecedented, it is also unprecedented for the customers and their families who may also now be facing considerable financial hardship and stress. I am also unsure how to get refunds for the hundreds of pounds paid directly to the airline for reserved seating and upgrades. Is there anything I can do? Would be great if the government could offer stronger advice on this as thousands of families are impacted.Nick has the following advice:Your situation is a familiar one I’m afraid. You are entitled to a refund and I think you will get one eventually, but there is not much you can do until some of the pressure has eased on travel companies. Frankly, if you insurance does cover the cancellation then claiming on that may be the easiest and quickest way of getting most of your money back.I was due to move to Spain three weeks ago. I have an official tenancy agreement and had given up my accommodation in Hove. Everything is packed and ready to go. I have been in isolation for the last three weeks and have followed the government advice. I looked on the gov.org website last night to find that I can actually travel if i\u0027m trying to get home, which is the case. I also looked at getting a ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe and they are still running. I am travelling alone and am obviously driving there. The borders are open for people travelling home and I can prove this. I am happy to travel at this time as the roads will be clear and it should be an easy run. My only concern is that I will have to break the journey up into at least three parts requiring me to spend the night somewhere twice. There are hotels open for people en-route and key workers. My question is, am I within my rights to do this?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:You are probably technically within your rights, but you may find is difficult to organise your hotel stays, and if you are stopped en route, different police forces or even different policeman may take a different view. It’s one of those very difficult situations with no easy answers I’m afraid. If you can possibly postpone it may be the best course of action.I have just returned a week early from a holiday in St Lucia. I have been unable to identify any government advice for travellers returning to the UK. Should we (a) self- isolate and if so, for how long? Or (b) simply follow social-distancing and work from home advice?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:There is no specific advice for travellers returning to the UK  without symptoms, so you should remain at home and stick to the current government guidelines on social distancing.Our next question comes from a reader who\u0027d like to remain anonymous. They ask:I have a question about UK holidays booked through Hoseseasons as an agent.Our cottage holiday has been cancelled (not confirmed by Hoseseasons yet) confirmed by the company closing their establishment.I do feel sympathetic towards the holiday provider but my question is can Hoseseasons refuse a refund and only offer alternative dates or can I push for a refund as they have not provided the service I paid for on the specific dates I paid for that service?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:Legally speaking, it seems clear cut that you are the victim of a cancellation and should be entitled to a cash refund rather than a credit or a postponement. I haven’t spoken to Hoseasons directly, but many companies - facing an extremely difficult financial situation - are doing their best to avoid paying out cash. They argue that these are extreme circumstances and that the cancellations are not their fault. Keep trying for a refund if it’s important to you, but you may face a long battle.Our next question also comes via email and is from John Booth. John asks: We are booked for a big family holiday to Orlando in July with Virgin Holidays.The balance is due in a couple of weeks and we are wondering what to do. My wife and I are self isolating at present. Would it be possible to see if Virgin would carry the deposit over until next year ?We don’t want to pay the balance and risk losing a lot of money as the party is  six adults and five children.Nick has the following advice:This is a tricky situation which many people are facing. I would definitely talk to Virgin and see if you can rebook for next year. If you can’t then wait and see what the situation is looking like in a week or ten days time - things may seem more certain by then.I have a holiday to Cyprus booked for then middle of August. Will I be able to travel?Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:It’s obviously impossible to say for sure, but there is a good chance you will be able to travel, assuming the virus is under control both here and in Cyprus. Certainly you shouldn’t think about cancelling until much near the time, or you risk losing the money you have already paid for your holiday.We have a holiday booked with TUI for travel to Tenerife on April 21. It is patently obvious that we won’t be able to travel but for the moment are unable to cancel. Why is this?Nick has the following to say:This is because, until this weekend the Foreign Office had only advised against travel overseas until April 15. Operators weren’t cancelling holidays beyond that because there was no legal requirement to do so, but also because they are currently struggling to cope with cancelling so many holidays due to depart before that date. The FCO has now extended its advice indefinitely however and I’m sure that TUI will focus on cancellations beyond April 21 very soon.Our first question comes from Kara Betton via email. Kara asks:When will we know if the Foreign Travel (non essential travel ban) is extended? When will we be able to start travelling abroad again?We are currently forbidden to travel abroad until mid-April as stated by the foreign travel advice. Many people have had holidays cancelled throughout the March and April period. However, Jet2 are planning to recommence travel abroad from May 1 depending upon the advice given.Here\u0027s what Nick has to say:In fact, the Foreign Office extended the ban indefinitely over the weekend, so that it is advising against all but essential travel in future, with no end date. This is an extremely confusing situation. Clearly, the FCO will, at some point lift its advisory for some destinations at least. And it can change the advice at any time.  But it is not clear how much notice it will give, nor how tour operators and travellers should deal with plans which have already been made in, say May, June or July. Instead of have a clear date - even one which may shift in stages - the FCO has left us in no man’s land. Personally, I think Jet2 are overly optimistic. Ryanair says that it is not expecting to significantly increase its flying programme until June.This Q\u0026ampA will be starting in ten minutes. Leave your questions for Nick in the comments section below or email them to yourstory@telegraph. See you soon!Transport and industryThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

London faces another outbreak of the plague, and your housekeeper Marie Mountjoy has fallen sick. The playhouses have been closed, so you spend your time scribbling down ideas for a new play: King Lear.Shakespeare, our greatest writer, certainly knew how to make the most of his self-isolation. With people stuck at home due to Coronavirus, we have set up the King Lear Prizes to encourage ordinary people to write, compose and create while they are in quarantine. The prizes are specifically for people with no professional experience in the arts and who have never been published before.   You’ve seen those Italians showing off and singing opera on the balconies of their apartment buildings whilst in quarantine. Well Britain’s answer will be perhaps a little more understated, but no less creative: an army of new indoor poets, authors, composers, dramatists and artists!  Our initial prizes are for people over 70 who are subject to the strictest quarantine conditions. They will need to add pencils and writing paper to their shopping lists for their volunteer helpers. However, given the pleas of parents who are working at home with their children, I suspect we will soon need to launch new prizes to keep the children busy too.  There are five categories: short story, short drama, poetry, musical composition, and art and you’ve got eight weeks to plan, write and refine your entries. If you have a creation inside you, get it out. Get it on paper and get it to us.  It would be easy to think of the arts as for solitary souls only: writers, composers and artists working away in their studios or studies without talking to anyone else, like creative hermits. But that couldn’t be further from the point of this competition! The arts are social, and the best part of this competition will be showing off your own entry to your friends and family.  We have panels of eminent judges like Julian Lloyd Webber and Steven Knight who have generously offered their time to select the winners, and we are offering a £1,000 prize for the top winner in each section. We’ll be sharing the short-listed entries with the public online, and we’ve got fantastic arts organisations like the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra ready to perform the winning works.  So if you are at home and are up for a creative challenge, it’s time to sharpen your pencil and start writing. If your parents or grandparents are at home, and could do with a challenge, call them up and tell them about the King Lear Prizes. Now is the time for a new wave of British artistic creativity to be unleashed, straight from the kitchen table.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Debenhams said it was preparing for all of its stores to reopen once the coronavirus lockdown conditions are eased by the government.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company said in a statement: “This move will protect Debenhams from the threat of legal action that could have the effect of pushing the business into liquidation while its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with the government’s current advice regarding the covid-19 pandemic.”It came as\u0026nbspdata showed the increasingly heavy economic toll caused by coronavirus, with construction slumping to its worst performance since the financial crisis, new car registrations plunging by more than 40 per cent and consumer confidence dropping at its fastest pace in more than four decades.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastSome 203,000 fewer new cars were registered in March than during the same month in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. A separate report from Auto Analysis and Global Data forecast that manufacturers will lose out on $100bn (£82bn) in car sales as their factories lie dormant across Europe and North America.Meanwhile, the UK construction sector suffered its largest job cuts since 2010 after measures to stop the spread of coronavirus halted work and caused a slump in new orders.The closely watched IHS MarkitChartered Institute of Procurement and\u0026nbspSupply (CIPS)\u0026nbspconstruction purchasing managers’ index\u0026nbspdropped to 39.3 for March, from 52.6 in February. Analysts had forecast a reading of 44, with anything below 50 indicating a contraction in activity.Duncan Brock, the group director at the CIPS, said: “With no upturn in sight, and with the fastest level of lay-offs since September 2010, the sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further.”There was more bad news for retailers too after a survey showed that consumer confidence plummeted in the last two weeks of March – a period in which some 950,000 people made new benefit claims.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Debenhams said it was preparing for all of its stores to reopen once the coronavirus lockdown conditions are eased by the government.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company said in a statement: “This move will protect Debenhams from the threat of legal action that could have the effect of pushing the business into liquidation while its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with the government’s current advice regarding the covid-19 pandemic.”It came as\u0026nbspdata showed the increasingly heavy economic toll caused by coronavirus, with construction slumping to its worst performance since the financial crisis, new car registrations plunging by more than 40 per cent and consumer confidence dropping at its fastest pace in more than four decades.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastSome 203,000 fewer new cars were registered in March than during the same month in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In such a scenario, a huge inflammation storm could inadvertently overwhelm vital organs such as the lungs.None of the theories compete with one another, and aspects of all of them, as well as innumerable other factors, could be at play in an inidual case.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr Edward Parker of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, explained how a high viral load can impact humans. He said: “After we are infected with a virus, it replicates in our body’s cells. The total amount of virus a person has inside them is referred to as their ‘viral load’. For Covid-19, early reports from China suggest the viral load is higher in patients with more severe disease, which is also the case for Sars and influenza.\u0026nbsp“The amount of virus we are exposed to at the start of an infection is referred to as the ‘infectious dose’. For influenza, we know that that initial exposure to more virus — or a higher infectious dose — appears to increase the chance of infection and illness. Studies in mice have also shown that repeated exposure to low doses may be just as infectious as a single high dose.”He added: “So all in all, it is crucial for us to limit all possible exposures to Covid-19, whether these are to highly symptomatic iniduals coughing up large quantities of virus or to asymptomatic iniduals shedding small quantities. And if we are feeling unwell, we need to observe strict self-isolation measures to limit our chance of infecting others.”Professor Wendy Barclay, the head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London, said existing knowledge of viral load means healthcare workers can be at greater risk of infection.“In general with respiratory viruses, the outcome of infection — whether you get severely ill or only get a mild cold — can sometimes be determined by how much virus actually got into your body and started the infection off.\u0026nbsp It’s all about the size of the armies on each side of the battle, a very large virus army is difficult for our immune systems army to fight off.“So standing further away from someone when they breathe or cough out virus likely means fewer virus particles reach you and then you get infected with a lower dose and get less ill.\u0026nbsp Doctors who have to get very close to patients to take samples from them or to intubate them are at higher risk so need to wear masks.”Genetic differences between those infectedScientists are currently preparing to scour Covid-19 patients’ genomes for DNA variations that might indicate why some people are more at risk than others.\u0026nbspThe findings could then be used to identify groups most at risk of serious illness and those who might be protected, and this knowledge could then inform the hunt for effective treatments.\u0026nbspA huge effort to pool DNA research from patients around the world is now on, with the ultimate goal being to build a body of evidence from people with no underlying health issues, but who have reacted differently to infection by the virus.One promising strand of research into why some people are more susceptible to the coronavirus is on the gene variation for the cell surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found on the outer membranes of cells, and which the coronavirus uses to enter cells in the lungs and airways.Variations in production of ACE2 could make it easier or more difficult for the virus to enter and infect cells.“We see huge differences in clinical outcomes and across countries. How much of that is explained by genetic susceptibility is a very open question,” geneticist Andrea Ganna, of the University of Helsinki’s Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, told Science Magazine.\u0026nbspAnother fascinating line of inquiry is whether different blood types could lead to differing levels of susceptibility to the disease.A Chinese research team reported in a non-peer-reviewed article that people with type O blood may be protected from the virus, and those with type A blood could be at greater risk.\u0026nbsp“We’re trying to figure out if those findings are robust,” Stanford University human geneticist Manuel Rivas told Science Magazine.The first results from the investigations into genetic differences and susceptibility are expected in less than two months’ time.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It occurs when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth in its monthly orbit.On 7-8 April, the moon will get as close as 356,907km (221,772\u0026nbspmiles) to Earth, making it appear bigger and brighter in the night\u0027s sky.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon is known in folklore as the \u0027Pink moon\u0027, as it usually coincides with spring flower blossoms.The best time and date to see April\u0027s\u0026nbspsupermoon\u0026nbspis at moonrise on Tuesday and at moonset on Wednesday, when it is close to the horizon.How to take the perfect picture of the supermoon this weekThis is due to an optical illusion that makes it appear even bigger due to its relative size to buildings and objects on the horizon.\u0026nbspThe supermoon\u0027s peak illumination will take place just after\u0026nbsp6pm\u0026nbspGMT on Tuesday, though it may not be visible until after sunset.The term was first coined by astrologer Richard Nolle\u0026nbspin 1979, who defined a supermoon\u0026nbspas any full moon that was within 90 per cent of its closest approach.The coinage and use of the term has been criticised by astronomers, however some welcome it as a way to encourage interest\u0026nbspin astronomy.“Some astronomers complain about the name supermoon. They like to call supermoons hype,” astronomer and EarthSky contributor Bruce McClure wrote recently.Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016“But supermoons aren’t hype. They’re special. Many people now know and use the word supermoon. We notice even some diehards are starting to use it now... No doubt about it. Supermoon is a catchier term than perigean\u0026nbspfull moon.The supermoon will also have an effect on the Earth’s ocean, Mr McClure notes, with the extra gravitational pull from the moon creating extra-high\u0026nbsptides.People living along the coast will notice them one or two days after the supermoon has passed, though any risk of flooding is unlikely unless the high tides are combined with severe weather.For most parts of the UK, Tuesday and Wednesday will see exceptionally good weather with highs of up to 24C\u0026nbspin the south and east.Clear skies and reduced air pollution due to the coronavirus lockdown means April’s supermoon could be one of the best ever times to view a supermoon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She added her reasons for visiting her second home were “not legitimate reasons to be out of my home” and understood she did not follow her own advice.“While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that,” added Dr Calderwood.“I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the first minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe apology\u0026nbspcomes after The Scottish Sun published photos of Dr Calderwood and her family near a coastal retreat in Earlsferry, more than an hour away from Edinburgh,\u0026nbsplate on Saturday.Days before, the 51-year-old posted a photo of her family at their main residence in Edinburgh on Twitter, as they joined the rest of the nation in clapping for front line NHS workers.In the daily coronavirus press briefing on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon\u0026nbspsaid: “The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so, it was wrong and she knows that.“All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in.

It is vital that everyone adhere\u0026nbspto these requirements.“Police officers and staff are putting themselves in harm’s way day and night to explain these instructions to our communities, encourage co-operation and, where necessary, enforce them.”In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: “It is difficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdown if she has not even followed it herself.”They added: “If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland’s constitution secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood’s visit was “ill-advised”. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed it was an overnight stay to “check on a family home”.Mr Russell said she would be “answerable” for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: “I’m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.”Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the “reasonable excuses” providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: “In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.”Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the first minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the first minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet members of the public still able to help are signing up to serve a worthy cause.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMarina Nenadic, 30, is one of a several new recruits at\u0026nbspCity Harvest\u0026nbspin Acton, west London, after the food surplus charity called for more hands to sort through the produce rescued from restaurants, manufacturers and supermarket packing houses.“I’m working from home four days a week, so I had some extra time, and I really wanted to do something useful with it,” she explained. “It’s within walking distance of where I live, so I’m not taking any extra risks with journeys.”How to support our campaignMs\u0026nbspNenadic\u0026nbspis a marketing executive for\u0026nbspKew\u0026nbspGardens, but she now spends at least one day a week creating crates of food packages for the 300 smaller groups – including\u0026nbspfood banks, low-income family projects and homeless shelters – served by City Harvest.“It’s a really positive atmosphere, despite the fact it’s such difficult times. It’s actually quite exciting to see so much food come in, knowing it’s going out to people who need it. It’s been such a rewarding thing to do.”In the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, City Harvest has rescued and redistributed over 130 tons of surplus food. Responding to the enormous scale of the crisis, the group has joined forces with even larger food surplus charities in the capital – our campaign partner The Felix Project and Fareshare – to create the\u0026nbspLondon Food Alliance.In a bid to make sure\u0026nbspfood gets out to those who need it\u0026nbspas efficiently as possible, the London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies.Liz Taylor, 61, signed up for volunteering work at The Felix Project last week, and is now packing and delivering food at\u0026nbspthe charity’s main Park\u0026nbspRoyale\u0026nbspwarehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s actually a bit of relief to get outside and do something. It’s obviously worthwhile, but it’s good for my wellbeing too.”Mohamed Elmi, 34, volunteering with City Harvest for the past 18 months, says\u0026nbspsome of the Acton-based charity’s few dozen or so new volunteers have recently lost jobs in the hospitality industry.“It’s been a difficult time for them but this gives them a sense of purpose,”\u0026nbspsays Mr Elmi, who also works full-time for a homeless healthcare charity. “It’s really helped us fill in for some of the volunteers who are having to stay at home. Yes, we’re putting ourselves at risk – but this work is really needed right now.”London mayor Sadiq Khan told The Independent: “The altruism of the British people in recent days has been a beacon of hope amid the darkness of the coronavirus.”He added: “You can donate spare food at a series of hubs being set up across the city. If you can afford to, you can donate money directly to help keep the food banks open. And if you are fit and healthy, you can volunteer your much-needed time.”The Independent is asking food aid charities across the UK to contact us at helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and what problems you are facing right now.You can help us build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Candidates had effectively suspended their campaigns last month as the infections of Covid-19 started to escalate in the UK.Coinciding with Mr Corbyn’s resignation, Boris Johnson also wrote to the leaders of opposition parties at Westminster, inviting them to a briefing of senior government advisers next week as he insisted “we have a duty to work together at this moment of the national unity”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the Green New Deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions had developed a dry cough and all are expected to recover.On April , the World Organisation for Animal Health said: Now that Covid- virus infections are widely distributed in the human population there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans.Several dogs and cats have tested positive to Covid- virus as a result of contracting the disease from their owners, it added.In America, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreported that a very small number of pets outside the US reported to be infected with the virus that causes Covid- after close contact with people with coronavirus.The World Organisation for Animal Health said that more studies are being carried out to gauge the susceptibility of dferent animal species to the virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species.The organisation stressed, however, that, currently, there is no evidence to suggest that animals infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of Covid-. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person contact.To date, there is no evidence that companion animals have spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justication in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare.Here, in the UK, official government lines published on March  state that there is no evidence of coronavirus circulating in pets or other animals in the UK and there is nothing to suggest animals may transmit the disease to humans.However, in line with the general advice on fighting coronavirus, you should wash your hands regularly, including before and after contact with animals.A spokeswoman for Battersea told The Sun Online: There is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus to people.Researchers in China said that cats can be infected with the coronavirus that causes Covid-, and can spread it to other cats, but dogs are not really susceptible to the infection.There is currently no evidence that animals can transmit coronavirus to humans, according to the World Health Organisation Please do not abandon or stop giving your animals attention.All non-essential trips to vets should be avoided.If your pet needs urgent treatment, you must phone the vet to arrange the best approach to meet your pets’ needs.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.You can find Battersea’s advice to pet owners on its website.The Canine and Feline Sector Group - made up of the UK’s leading dog, cat, and veterinary organisations - has also put together guidance for pet owners and dog walkers during the pandemic.The British Veterinary Association’sadvice for pet owners diagnosed with Covid- is:If your dog cannot exercise at home, you should ask someone outside of your household to walk your dog for you.You may leave your house to exercise once a day and you should combine this with walking your dog.It is important that you minimise the time spent outside of the home and remain two metres away from anyone outside of your household.Remember to wash your hands and remain two metres away from anyone outside your household.This counts as caring for a vulnerable person, which includes those self-isolating or being shielded.Remember to wash your hands before and after handling the dog and keep two metres away from other people and animals while walking, including when handing over the dog to the owner.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Let’s not let that slip this sunny weekend.Fridays news was relentlessly grim — and Health Secretary Matt Hancock commendably blunt. Another  have died, two brave nurses among them. Mr Hancock doesn’t know when the deaths will peak.Nor can officials ­estimate how many people actually have coronavirus, or have had it, on top of those who have tested positive.Meanwhile the antibody tests, which would prove who’s immune and are the key to getting our economy going again, don’t work . . . anywhere in the world.The only “green shoots” are our stoic compliance with the lockdown and the huge numbers volunteering for clinical drug trials.Add to that the heroic work of the NHS, public support for it, and the rapid expansion of its capacity.With the Easter holidays on us and the sun shining, the temptation will be to venture out and socialise. We must resist.It’s tough. It will be tougher still for parents next week, with everything cancelled and precious little homework to occupy the kids.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that. This is truly a national effort.Each and every one of us has to play our part.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday. It is a lockdown.It is being done to save your le or the le of someone you love.The bottom line is that officers have to ensure the guidelines are adhered to, but it is how they go about it that is important.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealIn the meantime, police chiefs are urging snoopers to use online hotlines to tell tales about neighbours who are breaching the Government’s lockdown.Humberside has created a dedicated online portal where people can submit tip-offsthey spot gatherings of more than two people.West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset are urging the public to alert them to breaches by using online forums, rather than phoning  or .To my mind, this raises ethical questions.hould we really become a nation of snitches Should we not all just concentrate on our own families and trust that others will take care of themselves Is the act of reporting the selfish idiots who disregard the Government advice really community spirit Or is it just the ultimate curtain-twitching exercise — which encourages serious pettiness Apparently, the police have had calls from people asking them to come and arrest a neighbour for going on a second run in one day.In an ideal world we would all just abide by the rules and there would be no need to report others.Sadly, though, needs must.If your neighbour is driving to the seaside when you are stuck indoors at home, they are ruining the purpose of this lockdown for everyone, they are selfish and they should be stopped.If people do not abide by the rules, what choice do you have Butyou do just stay home there will be no need to worry about whether your neighbours are phoning the police about you.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star. She reveals that she wouldfrom another hard sht on the runway to discover that her bra and knickers had been stolen by obsessive fans.“It was insane,” she says. “Like being a rock star.”Well, not quite, Claudia. I never met a rock star who wore underpants.THESE days sporting headlines are largely concerned with our heroes revealing themselves to have the brain power of pigeons.Boxer Billy Joe Saunders .Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish .Stoke’s James McClean .They can give Sports Personality Of The Year to Tyson Fury now.And next time, the cruel, contaminated markets of China could produce an even more virulent disease.NO wonder George Moore, five, looks pleased with the “old man haircut” given to him by his brother Harry, seven.Some blokes have to wait  years for a haircut like that, George.IN an interview to promote the next  film, No Time To Die, Bond girl Lea Seydoux says that the #MeToo movement is riddled with “hypocrisy”.Lea, who plays Dr Madeleine Swann, said: “People knew! And they take advantage now to say, ‘Yes, I’ve been a victim’.

and Covid- attacks the respiratory system, health officials say.They also point to a small but highly impactful survey from China which finds that smokers with Covid- are  times more likely to develop severe disease.The study looked at the factors which led to the progression of Covid- pneumonia in patients at three hospitals in Wuhan, China - where the first cases of coronavirus were detected late last year.A history of smoking was among the factors which were identied by the study which took place between December  last year and January .Age, maximum body temperature on admission and respiratory failure were among other notable factors, according to the study, which was published in the Chinese Medical Journal.These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of Covid- pneumonia, it concluded.It has been reported that more than , people have died of Covid- in China.PHE also says the virus is given an easy route of entry by the repetitive hand to mouth movement used by smokers.Prof Newton told smokers that it is never too late to quit, no matter your age and the body will continue to repair the longer you stay smoke-free.The elimination of carbon monoxide from the body is among the immediate benefits of quitting smoking.People should find that their lungs start to clear out mucus and other smoking debris, PHE says.Breathing becomes easier as bronchial tubes begin to relax after  hours of quitting smoking and blood circulation improves, making physical activity like walking and running easier within  weeks of giving up the habit.Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at Action on Smoking and Health , said: “Now, more than ever, smokers can help themselves, their families and their communities by quitting.There is a raft of help that smokers can still access.Stop smoking services are moving to provide telephone support, and pharmacists can provide advice on medications, butyou can’t find help locally get advice online from the Todayistheday website, and through the nightly Quit Clinic on Twitter using #QuitForCovid.The first two patients to die at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, detailed in the Lancet Medical journal, were both long-term smokers.Researchers from China and the US carried out an analysis of the first , cases of coronavirus.They found that men were more likely to be diagnosed with the disease and suffer severe symptoms, including pneumonia.Their findings also revealed that the survival rates between males and females were markedly dferent.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealIn the first six weeks of the outbreak . per cent of women died compared with . per cent of men.Experts believe there are a few reasons for this discrepancy, including some biological and other lestyle choices, such as smoking.In China, men are much more likely to smoke than women, which can lead to a weaker immune system.In fact China has the largest population of smokers in the world - accounting for nearly a third of the worlds smokers - but just two per cent of them are women.Meanwhile, in the UK . per cent of men - around . million - and  per cent of women - around . million - reported being current smokers.The study showed that being an older male is another risk, with almost  per cent of infected men over the age of  succumbing to the disease.Men were also disproportionately affected during the SARS and MERS outbreaks -

But the coronavirus crisis has brought the UK’s fuzzy, unwritten constitution into focus - with many people confused about who is actually in charge. And even with Dominic Raab filling in for the PM in cabinet meetings and other duties, it’s unclear how far his powers reach. And it’s far from certain who would replace the Prime Ministerhe dies suddenly or is incapacitated for a long period. In the United States, which has a strict written constitution, there are well developed procedures in place for when a President is incapacitated. There’s a legal line of succession, running from the Vice President, through the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate, then right the way through the Cabinet. Currently, some  people would have to die or be incapacitated before Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson became President. In fact, that’s more or less the plot of the TV show Designated Survivor. But in this country, we have neither a strict, written constitution nor a legal line of succession so everything becomes a little more…murky. Here’s what we know. Does Boris Johnson have a deputy   When he formed his first cabinet, Boris Johnson chose not to have a formal Deputy Prime Minister. It’s not a requirement, and most PMs don’t. David Cameron had Nick Clegg as his deputy, but that was mostly to keep the coalition government afloat. Instead, there’s a slightly vague convention that the First Secretary of State deputises for the PMthey can’t do the job. First Secretary of State isn’t really a job - it’s a title someone has to imply seniority over other Cabinet ministers. It’s also worth remembering that even though Nick Clegg was Cameron’s Deputy PM - he named former Tory leader William Hague First Secretary of State. Currently, the title belongs to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Number  said last night that Boris Johnson had asked Mr Raab to deputise for him “ necessary.” Who takes overDominic Raab becomes ill  This afternoon the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman saidMr Raab became incapacitated, then rookie Chancellor Rishi Sunak would take over from him. The spokesman said: There is an established order of precedence. The Prime Minister has you know appointed the Foreign Secretary as his First Secretary of State. In line with the order of precedence the Chancellor would follow from the Foreign Secretary.Why isn’t there an official deputy  Because - technically - the country is run by the Cabinet rather than the PM alone. The Prime Minister is supposed to be ‘first among equals’ in the Cabinet. Can Dominic Raab reshuffle the cabinet in Boris Johnson’s absence  Apparently not. The PMaposs official spokesman was askedMr Raab could do any hiring and firing of ministers in the Prime Ministeraposs absence. He replied: The short answer to that is no.  Who’s in charge of the nuclear weaponsthe PM is incapacitated  That’s a very good question. In theory, Dominic Raab as First Secretary of State could authorise military action - but he would most likely have to obtain the support of senior cabinet ministers to do so. Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: In relation to national security matters the First Secretary of State and the Cabinet have the authority and ability to respond in the Prime Ministeraposs absence. The UK has robust national security architecture, including the National Security Council , which is designed to be resilient and able to operate effectively under dferent circumstances. Should any NSC be required the Foreign Secretary would chair it. He added: In relation to nationa security decisions are taken by the Cabinet. The Foreign secretary would chair any Cabinet meeting. There’s also the question of the so-called ‘letters of last resort’ - which the PM writes to give instructions to nuclear commanders in case he’s killed in an attack. Number  say Mr Raab has not been asked to write letters of his own, because the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister. ButMr Johnson is out of action for a long time - orhe stepped down - someone  may be asked to write letters of their own. Will Dominic Raab take over Boris Johnsonaposs weekly audience with the Queen  No. Number  say the Queen and Buckingham Palace have been in constant contact and are getting updates on the PMaposs condition. But instead of Mr Raab having a weekly  meeting with the monarch, as the PM usually does, senior officials - specically Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill and the Prime Ministeraposs Principal Private Secretary will continue contact with the royal household on his behalf.

The couple, who have been married for  years, choose a new theme each day, and upload photos to their Facebook page called aposKeeping Up with the Prices Isolation Adventuresapos. So far they’ve enjoyed a game of cricket and a romantic meal in the kitchen, taken their china dog for a walk while wearing crash helmets, and battled dragons in a Game Of Thrones-inspired duel. Mrs Price said they are currently mourning the loss of Alan’s sister Eve, who died after contracting Covid-, but they are thrilled to be bringing a smile to people’s faces.

Sally Goodright and five other staff wore personal protective equipment , including gloves, masks and plastic face shields, as they moved corpses at a hospital where the mortuary is full. They ran out of body bags as the dead continued to arrive from the wards. Miss Goodright told how she became emotional when she noticed the names of patients she has cared for and loved ones of people she knows. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The nurse described distressing scenes at West Middlesex University Hospital in Isleworth, west London, in a Facebook post that has been shared thousands of times. She shared photos showing herself wearing PPE, including a face mask and shield, hairnet or mob cap, gloves and apron. She hailed the work of exhausted NHS staff, and hit out at people who are ignoring the Covid- lockdown and social distancing rules and told how she is desperate to go back to my old le.  Miss Goodright urged people to do the right thing and stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus, save lives and ease pressure on overwhelmed healthcare workers. In her post, she wrote: After the morning delivering urgent care to diabetic patients I was asked to join a team to help out the staff in the mortuary at West Mid Hospital. The staff are so overwhelmed with deaths that they canapost cope.  large fridges have been placed in the carpark because the mortuary is full. So along with  Podiatric Surgeons, a Podiatric Professor,  Audiologists and myself we were asked to ferry  bodies from the morgue to the fridges. The fridges are situated the other side of the hospital so we had to work in pairs to get the heavy, bulky trolleys across. All of the dead were still infectious so full PPE was needed, it was hot and sweaty but being fully aware of how important the PPE is we had to persevere for hours on end. It all got particularly upsetting when I saw names of patients I treat on a regular basis and names of peoples loved ones that I was unaware had died. She added: We ran out of body bags but still the dead were arriving from the wards. Everyone is doing such a fantastic job and really working as a team from surgeons, porters, cleaners and the brilliant crew that are making sure the fridges are in situ and in full working order.  Miss Goodright urged people to comply with the lockdown and social distancing rules. She wrote: This morning I saw families setting up equipment for circuit training on Twickenham Green and on my way home I saw families in Radnor Gardens setting up badminton nets and others playing football. What part of STAY AT HOME. SAVE LIVES do these people not understand  This really isnapost essential exercise.  Pop on a Joe Wicks workout and stay indoors.

CPAP uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate, thereby boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs. But Prof Hill said many Covid- patients eventually #xCprogress to invasive ventilation#xD. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves. A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient#xs own breathing. The patient is heavily sedated while a device called an endotracheal tubeis guided through the mouth into the windpipe. Heavy sedation is then continued because having a tube in the throat can be very uncomfortable. Patients can be fed at the same time through a tube going into their stomach via their nose. \",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-coronavirus-pandemic-live-advice-\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-coronavirus-pandemic-live-advice-\",,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news uk-coronavirus-pandemic-live-advice-\",, said that many patients suffering from Covid- need help breathing. Ventilators can be invasive, which involves a tube being put down the patient#xs throat, or non-invasive - such as breathing through a specialised mask. Mechanical ventilation tends to be recommended for coronavirus patients, Prof Hill said. - Who will lead the Government  The Prime Minister#xs official spokesman said that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would take overMr Johnson was unable to work due to illness.

Public places, including cinemas, restaurants and bars, are closed, and schools are only open to the children of key workers.When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, he said it would be in place for an initial three weeks. However, itaposs unlikely that measures will be relaxed until infection rates are on a downward trend, and the death toll decreases. Experts believe the lockdown could be in place for up to six months.  While the government is due to review the lockdown measures next week, Michael Gove has made it clear that there is no fixed date for when things will get back to normal.What needs to happen before the lockdown can be lted Before the lockdown measures can be relaxed, there needs to be a signicant decline in the number of coronavirus cases.If they manage to flatten the curve enough, the strategy can change - instead of social distancing and isolating people, the government will be able to fight coronavirus by testing patients believed to be infected, identying everybody who they have been in contact with, and stopping chains of transmission.

Maggie Ilsley issued a warning to others in a scathing post online - adding that the ordeal had left her sickened beyond words.  She said her mother Margaret Emerson, , had been contacted by her doctor out of the blue last week and taken through a questionnaire. It wasnapost until the end she realised she had just agreed to waive emergency treatmentshe contracted Covid- and die at home instead. Mrs Emerson already suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseso has been classed as vulnerable and is self-isolating. Daughter Maggie claims that the decision was framed for her mother as a choice between dying alone in hospital or at home. She added that it was also unclear whether Mrs Emerson had signed her le away regardless - askingan ambulance would arrive for a non-coronavirus incident. The call was placed by her motheraposs doctor at a surgery in Yate, Gloucestershire. She said: She had no warning about the call, and no idea what it was really about until it began to dawn on her from the questions the doctor was asking her. It was about what kind of care would she receive, and she signed that sheaposs not going to have an ambulance called out. It was framed for her as a choice between dying alone in hospital, or dying at home with her family there. Maggie first raised the issue on Facebook in a y post. She wrote: My mumhad a phone call late today when she was on her own from her GP. Sheaposs too upset to talk about it at the moment BUT has unwittingly with no time to think answered a whole realm of questions resulting in her medical records being updated to state that were she to get Covid  she will NOT go to hospital and will NOT be receiving any treatment !!!! The GP even confirmed that her responses were being entered onto the system and that the hospitals and ambulances would have access to them and know not to attend to her. How on earth   Iaposm sickened beyond words. Why are our GPs phoning our elderly vulnerable loved ones unannounced with absolutely no forewarning, no time to think, no time to talk things through with loved ones, no breathing space to make sure they understand the implications of what theyaposre being asked..with a list of questions aimed at them going on record there  then to refuse treatment and even an ambulance in the event they get Covid    How can that be morally right and allowed to happen ! What has our society come to   How can they phone vulnerable people out the blue and asktheyaposd rather die at home than alone in hospital   Wtaf ! Are they trying to guilt trip or trick our extremely vulnerable loved ones, who may have no idea and be totally alone and caught off guard, into sacricing themselves for those they deem more worthy  This is so wrong. On so many levels. And - how would they know my mum even had Covid theyaposre only testing on hospital admission   Has she just been asked to sign her le away, die at home in isolation, regardless ! I donapost know how Iaposm going to sleep tonight. Our vulnerable need protecting now!!!! This is beyond scandalous. [My mum] has COPD  heart disease but has been living with these conditions for almost  years. She does not have or require home oxygen and manages her condition with medication. She lives alone and is totally independent. Sheaposs following guidelines and is living in self isolation. Sheaposs the rock that holds our family together. You will never meet such a selfless woman.

The pair were put on ventilators at Memorial Hospital in Gulfport, but tragically neither of them could be saved. He conducted a ceremony for the couple at their Long Beach home.

They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2f2091cd-a9ae-4688-b6e2-e07f9ff49766-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2f2091cd-a9ae-4688-b6e2-e07f9ff49766-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2f2091cd-a9ae-4688-b6e2-e07f9ff49766-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2f2091cd-a9ae-4688-b6e2-e07f9ff49766-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united out of contract","story":"I have to say I feel for players at Dundee and United right now – especially those out of contract this summer.It’s a horrible situation for a lot of people in their jobs right now with no real knowledge of what is going to happen and footballers are no dferent.It is a job at the end of the day, a good one and one a lot of people would love to have.But, just like everyone , players have families and bills to pay. That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp

finished rehab on my knee and wasn’t even sure I’d be able to play on anyway.Thankfully, Dundee United gave me a chance, though the uncertainty continued even so.I wasn’t sure my knee would hold up and they gave me a contract from September to June on £ per week – a far cry from the million-pound lestyle people associate with some footballers.There was an appearance fee on top but spending time on loan at Ross County meant I couldn’t get that and it was a really tough time in my career.Right now, there are worse things going on in the world with people’s health but adding the stress and worry of work problems just piles on top for a lot of people.I think the move to furlough staff for the time being is a sensible one for both city clubs.What the players are desperate for now is some sort of certainty from the powers-that-be.The UK Government has gone to town on footballers this week completely unfairly.They are an easy target right now.I understand why people think players should front up and take pay cuts to either help non-playing staff at clubs or the NHS or whatever.However, they all seem to be lumped in the same bracket when only a small percentage of professional footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting excitement as you can get at the moment.I didn’t have much luck in my sweepy – my virtual horse fell over a virtual

maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e43c7674cc1a8.50317842-795x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee boss james mcpake on his life in football","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger and George Cran are joined by Dundee manager James McPake to talk through his career on the pitch and le since taking up the Dens Park hotseat.The coronavirus lockdown means we are working from home, over the internet, to produce Twa Teams, One Street at present.We hope to continue to bring you podcasts in this uncertain period, eventhey#re with a slightly dferent flavour.Thank you for listening and call the Twa Teams, One Street fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/HEALTH-Coronavirus-17212881_35135043-782x564.jpg ","title":"poll should brexit be put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic","story":"The UK Government has rejected a call from Scotland’s Constitution Secretary to pause Brexit negotiations due to the coronavirus pandemic.Mike Russell wrote to Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, requesting a halt to the withdrawal process during the coronavirus pandemic.But the UK Government said it had “no intention of changing” the December  date for ending the transition period.Mr Russell has now written again to Mr Gove to restate the Scottish Government’s case.Mr Russell said there will be “dismay across Scotland” and much of the UK at the UK Government#s “intention to plough on with their plans for a hard Brexit, or indeed a no-deal Brexit, in less than nine months’ time”.He questioned how the UK Government can be focused on tackling coronavirus while also pursuing Brexit negotiations and said there had been “no meaningful discussion of issues with the devolved governments for almost two months”, with none likely in the foreseeable future due to the pandemic.He added: “But, bluntly, is the UK Government now expecting the Scottish Government to ert resources from tackling Covid- to carry out the necessary, extensive work that would be involved “There is still time to change course – and the UK Government should confirm without delay that they will seek the year’s extension that is on offer from June.  That would ensure that every effort is put to tackling the pandemic emergency.A UK Government spokeswoman said: “Our top priority as a government is to slow the spread of the coronavirus, protect the NHS and keep people safe – we are working around the clock to do so, with all four nations together providing unprecedented financial support for businesses, workers and the self-employed.“We remain fully committed to the negotiations.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

then feeling isolated.We were very conscious of not going anywhere busy, and the need to avoid close proximity for ourselves as well. It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

We couldnrsquot do anything without them.ldquoThe children did an amazing job at serving and keeping everyone fed and hydrated.The pupils then performed The Very Hungry Caterpillar story in French and sang some French songs.Thanks to donations from all the guests, the school raised pound.Ronnie Taylor, headteacher at Stenton, Innerwick and West Barns Primary Schools, said: ldquoI think it was fantastic, I was really proud of the boys and girls.ldquoI think they worked really hard in the lead-up to what we were doing and itrsquos events like these that not only bring the learning of the curriculum together but bring the community together as well, which is really important in a place like Stenton.ldquoThe school is always supported we are very lucky we have an engaged community and I think the children rise to the occasion every time."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-stone-sculpture-revealed-haddington","story":"The Free Gardeners, a fraternal society, was founded in the town in  and grew to have lodges all over the country, with more than , members in the Lothians alone.Now talented artist James Winnett has unveiled an intricately carved standing stone, inspired by the organisation, at Moncrieff Walk at the western end of the town.Mr Winnett said: ldquoI became fascinated with the story of the Free Gardeners, their rich symbolism, regalia and the artefacts they left behind.ldquoI wondered how a public artwork might make a tangible connection to these ideas, while referencing other links to local history and folklore.The Glasgow-based artist carved the seven-foot sandstone block as part of a public art commission supported by Persimmon Homes through East Lothian Councilrsquos Percent for Art scheme.The carvings on the stone include several Free Gardener symbols, such as the compass, set square and pruning kne, alongside depictions of the Tree of Le, lsquoJock in the Greenrsquo, the four rivers of the Garden of Eden, and Haddingtonrsquos emblematic goat climbing the Tree of Knowledge.There is also a reference to the former Mitsubishi factory ndash which stood on the site at Gateside before housing was built there ndash in the form of a beehive with three oak leaves above it, a nod to the origins of the Mitsubishi logo.Mr Winnett, who estimated he spent  days carving the stone, added: ldquoHalfway through the carving process, I turned the stone over and washed off the mud on the reverse face.ldquoIt was only then that I realised the whole surface was covered in plant fossils from more than  million years ago, which made a fortuitous link with the gardening theme!The -year-old artist visited Haddingtonrsquos John Gray Centre to find out more about the organisation.The Ancient Order of Free Gardeners, as they became known, bought a tenement in Haddington as their base, which became the Gardeners Arms pub.They ed like an early trade union or mutual aid society, supporting the poor while also holding floral exhibitions, tree planting ceremonies and colourful parades.Mr Winnett helped put the stone in place earlier this year and told the Courier: ldquoIt is a mixture of emotion at the end, partly a relief to get it in in one piece. It is a tricky thing to install.ldquoIt is a natural stone, itrsquos a funny shape, with flaws in the stone, and you have got a lot of preparation which goes into the foundations.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music.

When we first trawled the area in search of a home, the number of towers and turrets dotted among the hills or peeking from treetops was immediately apparent. They werenrsquot clustered, as in San Gimignano, but inch for inch they matched those on Tuscanyrsquos peaks.Itrsquos a reminder, were it needed, that murderous feuds were once a universal problem, not something dreamt up by Mediterranean dynasties or Scottish thugs. But the Borders saw more than its fair share of violence, and few parts of the country were as heavily fortied in the Middle Ages. While many of these strongholds now lie in ruins, their presence injects an undercurrent of menace to an otherwise idyllic scene.These past few days I have been thirled to my desk, writing about Mary Queen of Scots, who was frequently in these parts. Sometimes she was going about royal business ndash presiding over law courts in Jedburgh for instance ndash but often she was socialising, as when she was one of a hunting party at Traquair. Whatever their purpose, few of her visits passed without drama of some sort. On one particularly memorable occasion she was seeking refuge. In such times, the castles and keeps for which the region is famous, came into their own.The room where I work looks out on to the village green, where no car has passed this last hour, nor anybody walked by the window. The silence is thick. Even wildle seems to be on tiptoe. It is days since wersquove heard a plane, and the initial stream of brightly clad walkers and cyclists from nearby towns escaping the lockdown has long since dried up.With little  to do but get on with the next chapter in Maryrsquos story, I am struck by the irony that in bygone centuries people often went into self-isolation not just willingly but eagerly. Keeping people at a distance was sometimes essential to save your skin. No government edict was required to make these escapees haul up the portcullis or bar the gate. In fact, especially around here, it could be the governors of the day from whom they were retreating.When pestilence swept through communities, those who could afford to flee towns and cities for the countryside did so, for as many weeks as it took. No doubt the fortied dwellings around here came in useful in those circumstances, but itrsquos not what they were built for. Disease could pass through a portcullis or a keyhole, butthe place was well enough constructed, mortal enemies intent on tearing you limb from limb could not.The lordrsquos tower where villagers from Hoolet could run for safety leaves only a trace today. Even when it was a landmark, it was so far off thatdanger had been at the door not even Usain Bolt would have reached it in time. No doubt when danger loomed lookouts would have been posted on the hills, beacons and torches spreading warnings fast. But while living in fear of sudden deadly attack sounds scary, was it any more alarming than the microscopic foe we currently face  Will far-distant historians look back at  and wonder how we coped  For that matter, will we Long before the present emergency, when isolation is an inflexible order rather than a whimsical choice, Irsquove always secretly wanted to live in a fortied keep. Smailholm Tower is my ideal. The thought of looking down from upstairs to see who is knocking on the studded door greatly appeals. A friend who lives in a th-century house in Italy always unlatches the kitchen window, on the first floor, and calls out ldquoFriend or foe  when we arrive. There are no windows at ground level.Borders keeps donrsquot have the space or allure of castles ndash I canrsquot see a series called Escape to the Peel Tower ndash but they are brilliantly designed for splendid isolation. Admittedly those with mobility problems or serious underlying health issues might have trouble reaching the bathroom under the rafters. Nor are they for the very tall, who risk concussionthey sit up suddenly in bed.Generally therersquos one room on each level, and the stairs from cellar to rooftop are a vigorous workout. Just bringing lunch from kitchen to dining table burns calories. The turnpike stair between floors is wide enough for one person only, presumably so you could single-handedly fight off anyone who got inside, skewering them inidually as they appeared. The walls are thick enough to withstand fires intended to smoke you out, the windows too small for any but a sniperrsquos aim, and the parapets heaven-sent for tipping boiling water or tar on to those below. Cannon balls could do fearful damage and eventually bring the household out waving white flags, but that would take time. The most pressing worry for anyone besieged in a keep was lack of ale and hunger. In that respect things arenrsquot so dferent for us.Fleeing from her rebellious lords in June,  Mary Stuart escaped to Borthwick Castle with her disreputable Borderer husband the Earl of Bothwell. Shortly after, the army of those who wanted to depose her set up camp outside. Bothwell managed to nip out the back door, leaving the queen to rail at her besiegers from the battlements. Apparently her language was so foul the ambassador who reported the scene quickly redacted it.Borthwick is built to withstand siege for months on end, but one night Mary was lowered out of a window on to a horse, and rode through the dark to Dunbar. The castle there was all but impregnable. Arguably the biggest mistake she ever made, some days later, was to leave this safe haven. Anyone searching for parallels between those days and ours need look no further."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-clearer-guidance-issued-essential-construction-work","story":"New guidance for the industry restates that work on sites should stop immediately with certain key exceptions.The publication has been welcomed by the Scottish Building Federation- which has also called for more economic support during the lockdown.:Coronavirus: Construction industry in lsquoquicksandrsquo as staff lay-offs surgeProjects allowed to continue include those creating or repurposing facilities for the Covid- response, or accommodating key workers.\"Essential public services\" and the maintenance of \"critical infrastructure\" is also allowed to continue.

We have to, in our exit strategy, balance all of these dferent elements, which can be in tension,\" he added.At the daily No  briefing, Professor Dame Angela McLean, Chief Scientic Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, suggested social distancing was having an effect on slowing the virus and noted how the growth in admissions was ldquonot as bad as it could have been had the lockdown not been put in place.\"It is working but the big question is: is the virus spread slowing down enough to make hospital admissions stabilise and then even fall \"Dame Angela said the hospital admissions data by region had risen \"very steadily\" until April  and then showed a \"more complicated behaviour, starting we hope to slow down\".She added: \"But it really is too soon to see the effects of the big changes weve all made to our lives from March  onwards because thats only two weeks ago and it takes several weeks after youve become infected for you to realise youre ill enough that you really need to be in hospital.\"Were all watching these numbers very, very carefully and were very much hoping whats going to happen next is they will at least stop rising.\"Meanwhile, in an open letter addressed to the G, the group of former leaders, who included British prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major, called for the speeding up of the search for a vaccine, cure and treatments as well as reviving the global economy.They urge global collaboration and commitment to funding ldquofar beyond the current capacity of our existing international institutions.Their statement says: ldquoThe economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is addressed the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone but by ensuring recovery from Covid- in all countries.The ex-leadersrsquo plea is for agreement within days for:  billion to rapidly hasten the global effort for vaccines, cure and treatment bn to support health systems, from ventilators to test kits and protective equipment for health workers and bn for developing countries to fight the medical and economic crisis, prevent a second wave of the disease flowing back into countries as they come out of the first wave.This would mean waiving debt interest payments for the poorest countries, includIng bn due this year from Africa. The ex-leaders also propose a -bn issue of additional resources by the IMF in the form of special drawing rights.The letter also urges the co-ordination of fiscal stimuli to avoid a ldquoglobal recession becoming a global depression.In other developments:*the SNP branded as \"deeply reckless\" the UK Governmentrsquos refusal to extend the transition period beyond December , insisting its ldquofull focus must be on tackling coronavirus*Downing Street hit out at Russian \"disinformation\" after a state-run news agency claimed the Prime Minister would soon be put on a ventilator in his battle against coronavirus ndash Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden will meet social media giants this week to ldquostem the online hoods about the pandemic*the Queens address to the nation on Sunday evening was watched by more than  million people*the Foreign Office has announced more flights to repatriate UK nationals stranded around the world, including ones from India, Nepal, the Philippines and South Africa - but travellers will have to pay up to pound, for a ticket*Labourrsquos Tony Lloyd, , the former Shadow Scottish Secretary, is in a Manchester hospital after contracting coronavirus, the party revealed, saying he was ldquostable and responding to treatment*the , volunteer army in England is set to begin its work helping to deliver medicines from pharmacies, driving patients to appointments, bringing them home from hospital and making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home*Mark Drakeford, Wales First Minister, has called for an urgent Cobra meeting between the UKs four governments to review coronavirus lockdown measures.*No  said sunbathing was banned under coronavirus-tackling measures but stressed it was up to the police to use \"discretion\" in enforcing the rules.*industry figures show the number of new cars sold in the UK in March fell by  per cent or just over ,, compared with last year and*the Duchess of Cornwall, , has been reunited with the Prince of Wales after coming out of self- isolation at their Scottish retreat at Birkhall in Aberdeenshire - just days before their th wedding anniversary."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-mckie-sturgeon-right-try-keep-calderwood","story":"The days immediately preceding the peak of contagion during a pandemic would be, I am sure everyone can agree, about the worst imaginable time to lose any Chief Medical Officer, let alone one who is universally well regarded outside, and particularly inside, the medical profession.A good person, everyone agrees. Worth holding onto, everyone agrees.:In Calderwood scandal Sturgeon had to prioritise public health over personal excusesI said as much on Twitter, during the  hours between the breaking of the Sun on Sunday story and the resignation of Dr Calderwood as Chief Medical Officer, and again yesterday morning on BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme.Admittedly, however, I have had a fair amount of flak from a lot of people whom I both like and respect, and who profoundly dispute my analysis and feel that the First Minister badly mishandled the matter.Furthermore, to be fair, opinions on Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of Dr Calderwoodrsquos indiscretion are not entirely aligned to whether the holder of the opinion ticked a Yes box or the No box six years ago, as is depressingly common. On the contrary, I have spoken to, and seen comments from, many nationalists and SNP supporters who agree with unionists that Ms Sturgeon bungled Sunday in its entirety. That matters.They see Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions as having been indefensible, a case of one rule for her and another rule for the little people, and clearly deserving of an immediate sacking. They see Ms Sturgeonrsquos failure to do so as a failure of her leadership, even a case of her keeping a crony in post in defiance of all known political and PR gravity.I understand this viewpoint, and the genuine anger Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions provoked amongst the general public. And, even as someone who despairs at the political culture of calling for resignations, I think that the opposition leadersrsquo call for her to be removed was not unreasonable. In any normal time, theyrsquod be right, and this would be an open-and-shut case.However, I think the knee-jerk ldquoSturgeon screwed up analysis is missing two critical factors. The first is an understanding of how politics and PR work during the fastest-moving news environment we have ever seen. The conventional political and PR gravity to which I referred are not present during coronavirus. There are no rules. Thatrsquos why a government can lock us in our homes and still poll at over %. Thatrsquos why a government can shut down an economy and retain the confidence of most people that it is doing a good job. Thatrsquos why a government can tell people not to see their nearest and dearest and be listened to. There really are no rules.By observing the conventional rules of politics and PR, and immediately sacking Dr Calderwood, Ms Sturgeon would have taken every other option off the table. Instead, the CMOrsquos inclusion in the lunchtime press conference was not so much a vote of confidence as it was a buying of some time to see how the story developed, and to ascertain whether the CMO could be saved.This may not have made for a pleasant few hours on social media, but I would contend that it was a good few hours of leadership .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Scotlands chief medical officer resigns for not adhering to social distancing advice\",\"description\": \"Scotlands chief medical officer resigns for not adhering to social distancing advice\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media efihlhu poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests efihlhu.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Ms Sturgeon has plenty of political capital, and her team will rightly have judged that her personal handling of this is likely to be a -hour lsquobubble storyrsquo. We are enduring, or enjoyingyou prefer, an unprecedented volume and scale of news.Criticism of Ms Sturgeonrsquos management of the matter has PR competition with the Queen making an extremely rare address to the country, the UK Government Health Secretary suggesting that outdoor exercise might be banned, the election of a new leader of the Opposition, and the Prime Minister being admitted to hospital with the virus.In other words, she could afford to take a hitthere was even a scintilla of a chance of keeping Dr Calderwood in post. Because good people are worth holding on to.This first factor is connected to the second factor, that whilst Nicola Sturgeon the politician will have seen the attractiveness of a decisive sacking, Nicola Sturgeon the First Minister will have wanted to hold on to her coronavirus CMO by any means necessary.Dr Calderwood is very well respected amongst the medical profession. In a former le I was employed in that world, and I know from those to whom I have spoken that they consider her medical leadership to have been invaluable in preparing for the looming peak in cases. They genuinely worry about doing this without her, and they question whether her shoes can be adequately filled.And I suspect that, just as Professor Chris Whitty has become a crutch for Boris Johnson, Dr Calderwood will have become one for Ms Sturgeon. She is in the middle of a once-in-a-century crisis and sitting next to her at all times is someone who understands how to manage it. Irsquod argue that, far from being a failure of leadership not to sack her, it would have been a failure of leadership not to do everything possible to keep her.This has been a sorry episode for everyone. It is a problem for everyone reading this column, because it is at least a distraction from the fight against coronavirus, and at worst a setback against it.But it is perhaps also a lesson. A select group of doctors and scientists across the UK have effectively been co-opted by governments. They are now, to every degree, under the same scrutiny as politicians.What we have seen exposed, in a brutal  hours, is that the ldquodo as I say, not as I do approach which often characterises the medical profession can work in a clinical setting, but leads to disaster in a political one.Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersShops across Scotland are closing.

Dr Calderwood knew the rules, had fronted the campaign emphasising how vital it was to follow the rules, but still chose to ignore them. In the process, she has completely undermined those rules, which she must know herself.I can understand Nicola Sturgeonrsquos desire to stay loyal to someone she has worked closely with, but Dr Calderwoodrsquos behaviour was gross misconduct and it should have been immediately obvious to Ms Sturgeon and her advisers that the CMOrsquos position was untenable.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.THERE is no doubt Dr Calderwood had to resign, and should have gone within minutes, in spite of the excellence of her advice in this time of pandemic. Indeed, it was because she flouted her own advice.It doesnrsquot matter than Price Charles had done something arguably worse, travelling hundreds of miles with his personal security staff when exhibiting signs of a contagious virus. It doesnrsquot matter that the Prime Minister and his Covid- team had ignored the social distancing advice and contaminated each other: at one point the Prime Minister even insisting on shaking hands with all and sundry.It doesnrsquot matter that the same newspapers who jumped on the Chief Medical Officer, had the week previously attacked the police in England for trying to enforce that same travel ban, in that instance to the Peak District and other National Parks in England. No, all that matters is that Dr Calderwood had to go, a sad loss during a crisis, but what sticks in the craw is the unholy, slavering glee from a highly partisan media and Unionist politicians that they had, at long last ldquogot a scalp.GR Weir, Ochiltree.IN the justiable uproar over the resignation of the disgraced Catherine Calderwood, an extremely important isssue is in danger of being missed.By the time Nicola Sturgeon gave her disastrous press conference on Sunday, she knew that Dr Calderwood had been in Fe on at least two weekends when she should have been in Edinburgh. If we take the First Minister at her word that she had not known of the Chief Medical Officers whereabouts until that daythen she is admitting that she had lost operational control.Had the CMOs advice ndash which was cited as being so irreplaceably invaluable at the same press conference ndash was required, at short notice, she was over an hours drive away. The question is: why did the First Minster not know the whereabouts of her Chief Medical Officer at the time of a deadly pandemic Peter A Russell, Glasgow .THE Calderwood debacle raises the question of what has been the point of having a separate Scottish team giving its own daily briefings during this crisis. The answer is that it allows Ms Sturgeon her time in the limelight, and she is very much the star of the show. The Health Secretary is pretty much silent and sometimes absent, and the CMO has been allowed a couple of minutes to say her piece.I imagine most of us prefer to get our information from the decision-makers in London.

My understanding is that the dangerous and unhygienic conditions in a so-called \"wet market\" in China are where the virus started spreading from. I have seen no apology from the Chinese government about this, or reassurances that conditions over food hygiene have been improved, such as veterinary inspections, as would be the case in slaughterhouses in developed nations.When the crisis is over I would expect governments to raise the possibility of financial reparations for the countries worst affected.

There have been concerns around jobs and safety.The organisers of the petition are seeking to halt the plans and are asking for an independent assessment of the decisions and decision-making process around the project to be carried out.A number of MSP#s have stood in opposition to the plans, including Orkney#s Liam McArthur and Shetland#s Beatrice Wishart.Mr McArthur said: “I have been raising concerns about HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic services for some time now. No-one disputes the need to modernise the way in which these services are delivered, but even HIAL’s own consultants identied the ‘remote tower’ option as the most risky and costly.“The estimated costs of the project appear to fall far short of what will realistically be neededit is to have any chance of being delivered successfully. At the same time, staff have made clear the lack of proper consultation and the intention of many to leave the organisation. If that happens, our leline air services will be at risk of serious disruption.“After the members debate earlier this year, led by my Shetland colleague, Beatrice Wishart, the petition will give parliament a further opportunity to consider this issue. These proposals will have a profound effect on our island communities, so it is right that MSPs, particularly those representing the Highlands and Islands, have the chance to hold HIAL and Scottish Ministers robustly to account”.The petition can be found here.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/-1/-1/true/GN4_DAT_3062254.jpg--.jpg?1586164184000,url:http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/-1/-1/true/GN4_DAT_3062254.jpg--.jpg?1586164184000,@type:ImageObject},author:{@type:Person,name:Dessie Blackadder},dateCreated:2020-04-06T09:09:32Z,dateModified:2020-04-06T09:09:44Z,datePublished:2020-04-06T09:09:44Z,associatedMedia:[{@type:ImageObject,contentURL:resizer/-1/-1/true/GN4_DAT_3062254.jpg--.jpg?1586164184000}]}\u003c/script\n","title":"advice for consumers as major retailer appoints administrators","story":" The news that Debenhams have announced plans to enter administration may have left many of their customers in the Ballymena area who have gt vouchers wondering what their rights are.Debenhams, which has a Ballymena outlet, announced that it will file for administration for the second time in a year.John French, Chief Executive of The Consumer Council said: “At the moment Debenhams is still accepting gt vouchers online but this may change.

He has now written to retired teachers and classroom assistants asking them to volunteers.In his letter, the education minister said retired staff would work alongside existing staff to help supervise children.Mr Weir said: It is to provide a pool of volunteers so that we can cope in all situations. At the moment there are nearly  schools that are open over Easter. They are providing that service outside of normal term time.to provide the safety and to ensure the provision of those services as staff are rotating. This is to have a level of reserve pool so thatwe reach in any eventuality a spike in terms of the number of teachers that are off, in a particular area that there are people that can be called upon to provide that service.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Some  households in north Belfast were delighted when a mystery chocolate-laden benefactor left the confectionery at their doors. However, social distancing during these troubled times meant there could be no hugs or handshakes. After leaving the eggs volunteers from Tamhi, one of Northern Ireland#s biggest mental health charities, rang the doorbells and ran away in traditional #knick knock# style. It was all co-ordinated by Mickey Meehan, one of the charity#s two full-time employees, who took photos and later made a video of acts of kindness. We just decided to use our one allotted hour of exercise per day in a meaningful way, Mickey told the Belfast .We wanted to spread a bit of joy around our local community because there has been so much negativity and stress around coronavirusWe had a little bit of money set aside and then the Co-Op on the Oldpark Road gave us £ so we went to Asda and bought a lot of Easter eggs and we dropped them off at random houses in north Belfast.Mickey said they got tons of feedback from happy householders who found the treats on their doorsteps.People had been feeling asnobody cared about them, he said. But this put a smile on their wee faces. Mickey added: It cost very little to do but hopefully it has made a bit of an impact and helped spread some much-needed positivity around.One of the volunteers dressed up as a Power Ranger and another donned a Batman outfit while doing the rounds. Fortunately the police, who were on patrol in the area, gave the selfless activity their blessing. Can you imagine anything better than being a kid stuck indoors and getting an Easter egg from Batman  Mickey said.The video, which is accompanied by the song Lean On Me by the late Bill Withers, is attracting plenty of attention on social media and features several of the smiling recipients.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

He said: ““We have been getting an increased number of calls from the public who have additional waste and following the Government directive to close our household recycling centres, have nowhere to take additional waste. We appreciate that many are spending more time at home and accumulating more waste however, we would encourage people to do all they can to reduce waste by reducing, recycling and reusing where possible. “Our refuse collection services are operating as normal and we feel that most people have adequate provision through this service. For those with larger families, or specic medical needs, we understand this is a dficult time and are keen to help. We hope that this new helpline will assist us in doing that and reach out to the people in our communities who need additional help and support.” He added: ““It is important that people note that we are dealing with a pandemic emergency situation therefore this is not the time to do a major spring clean and expect the Council to come pick up large pieces of furniture, mattresses or white goods. We do not have the capacity to do this during this time and would encourage the public to refrain from this type of work or to store it within their garages or sheds until our bulky waste service is operational again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ms Boyle said she was concerned at reports that families are taking part in shopping trips. Please please adhere to one family member leaving home for essential items, she said. The retail workers are at their work stocking shelves and at the tills making sure we get what we need. googletag.cmd.push They have to go home to their families terried of what they may bring home with them. Our supermarkets are not a playground substitute. I understand for some parents it may not always be possible to leave your child at home for dferent reasons. Butyou can please leave the children at home when shopping. This action also saves lives too. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass.

At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours.

I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin.

They say anyone who needs assistance of this kind should contact other agencies.Downpatrick foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said the organisation regretted the changes it has had to make.When referrals are made, the name of the person, size of their family and address will be logged, alongside other helpful information including locations, post codes and details including the colour of their front door and what local landmarks they may be close to.Mrs Lennon said that the food parcels will be left outside the clientrsquos door and volunteers will not be entering peoplersquos homes.In addition, she confirmed that deliveries will be made every Wednesday and that as food supplies may be limited, the volunteers can only distribute what they have.Under the new guidelines, food donations can only be made at dedicated collection points at the Asda and Supervalu stores in Downpatrick at the Ballydugan retail park and Ballymote shopping centres respectively.Mrs Lennon said donations could no longer be left at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church.She said volunteers continue to be grateful for the support of many people to help needy families at what are challenging times for everyone.Two weeks ago, the foodbank launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic but has had to abort this to comply with Public Health Agency advice.Volunteers will still be relying on peoplersquos generosity to help them cope with demand in what are unprecedented times and have been pleased with the publicrsquos response to help them continue helping families in need.The foodbank hopes that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores as they are expecting increasing demand on the service.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.The Pantry Foodbank in Newcastle has also implemented a home delivery service to ensure the health and safety of volunteers, with all deliveries taking place on Thursday.Further information about Newcastle deliveries is available at   or via the foodbank Facebook page.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Craigavon ICU is full already, so we have very limited capacity to look after patients with severe strains of Covid-.“It’s all becoming a bit real now.”She went on: “Even though the novelty of isolation has begun to wear off, please don’t become complacent, stay at home as much as possible, just like before and I know you guys are doing that and enjoying time with family and you’re doing home schooling and cooking home cooked meals and I know you’re doing the best to keep some kind of routine and stability at home.”She urged people to keep doing that and then became emotional as she revealed she had decided to self isolate within her home: “Up till now I have had a pretty normal existence, I’ve been driving back and forth to work, the traffic has been a lot lighter, which has been nice, but other than that I’m a home bird so on my days off I just like to be at home anyway.“But last night as I was driving home I decided it was time to isolate myself from my husband, who by the way has been an absolute gem today, he carried all my computer equipment upstairs and has been leaving care packages for me at the door. Yesterday I was working with Covid- positive patients and I just realised how exposed we are as nurses. We have the facemasks and the visors but we were walking around with our normal unorms and just using the sleeveless aprons and gloves for looking after the patients when we were closer to them.”She said showering and changing facilities aren’t up and running yet but staff were doing their best to avoid cross-contamination when travelling to and from work and washing clothes at home.She said it was a “real challenge” and added: “Craigavon are doing their best at this time of crisis to get everything up and running, they’re looking after staff as well as they can.”She said hot meals were being provided and canteen staff greeted them with a smile: “They’re doing their best to look after us.”She said it was dficult to update because things are changing every day.Closing her remarks she finished with two readings from the Bible, from the Book of Proverbs, read in the form of a prayer: “I pray that you would trust in the Lord completely and not rely on your own opinions. I pray that you would rely, with all your heart, on Himto guide you.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
