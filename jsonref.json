(Picture: Alexander Crawley)What I Rent is ’s weekly series that takes you inside people’s rentals in London.Because trying to find a place in London to rent can be hellish.It’s tricky to know how much is a ‘normal’ amount to be paying each month. Countless viewings make you start to genuinely consider living in a flat with a fold-out bed in the kitchen. Meanwhile, you see other people’s perfectly decorated homes on Instagram and wonder what on earth you’re doing wrong.There’s a lot of mystery and confusion when it comes to renting, which isn’t helped by estate agents’ very flattering photos of ‘cosy’ studio flats and the average renter’s reticence to openly chat about what they’re getting for how much they’re paying.**Either because they’re embarrassed by just how much they’re spending, or they don’t want to make us all feel bad because they have a bargain.To get rid of the mystery, we’re going inside different Londoners’ rented properties each week, for a look at all the bits landlords might not show you.This week we’re talking to Miranda and George, who live with their two cats, Chess and Cinder.They pay £1,283 per month, plus £170 in bills. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How much are you paying?Miranda: We pay roughly £1,283, plus £170 a month in bills. We’ve been trying to a more eco-friendly electricity provider but they keep screwing up the account.Bizarrely, this was the cheapest flat we could find and it’s in the nicest area we looked. Some es in North London are charging over £1,300 a month for what looks like a slightly spruced up slum.And what are you getting for that price?Miranda: It’s got three rooms and a balcony – a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan livingcookingdining space.It’s in Highgate, just down from Boogaloo. We’re not talking Highgate Village here (the ultra expensive, lush bit), but we were drinking in the same local as Jude Law last weekend….How long have you lived there?The flat has a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan living roomdining roomkitchen. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How did you find it?Miranda: We set off one day determined to not return to my parent’s house until we’d found a flat.We started in Camden and walked up here – stopping at every single estate agent. We were just about to give up and head back east when we spotted a tiny estate agent next to Highgate station, and this was the first property they showed us. We fell immediately in love.George: Through a lot of searching. For the price we’re paying and the areas we were looking at, it was quite a full on process and we missed out on a couple of places before finally finding this one. But I’d say this was the best of any we saw for the price.And do you like it?We’re perfectly positioned at the top of the hill between Archway, Muswell Hill, Crouch End and Highgate Village. It’s perfect for running (try running up the hill from Chalk Farm and you’ll soon get a sweat on), it’s leafy, it’s got great transport links and there are any number of bars and restaurants.Unfortunately, we moved here in November when it was dark and miserable and we were both on quite strict training regimes so we’re only just starting to get to know the area properly and take full advantage of all its features.It was the cheapest place the couple could find. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I’m learning to play tennis in the most beautiful park five minutes from the flat and as soon as the weather comes back, we’re off to start swimming in Hampstead Ponds.Oh, and it’s super quick to get to the Emirates which is a blessing given the number of mid week 7.45 kick off games!George: Yes, I’m very much happy with where we live. It’s quiet enough to escape a lot of hustle and bustle from the centre of London but has easy and quick access to virtually wherever we’d want to go.We’re still exploring the area having moved in relatively recently but there’s certainly a bit more of a suburban feel, which suits me as I’m not originally from here.Do you have enough space for both of you and the cats?Miranda: Yes, but we have a lot of crap – we’re both hoarders. You can never have enough space.George: Absolutely. The balcony really adds an extra dimension in the summer and catches the sun from that side but even when not using that in the warm weather, I’ve not felt cramped at all.The balcony is a definite highlight. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Are there any annoying bits about the place where you live?Miranda: At the start I couldn’t work out how to operate the heating and there’s a serious draft from the balcony (no double glazing). But now that it’s warmer, that draft is kind of a blessing.George: Not really. Again, not being from London, I’d say the price we’re paying is absolutely extortionate for what we’re getting (even though we do really like it) but that’s more of a general gripe with living in this ridiculously overpriced city, I guess…Any plans to move again?Miranda: Next year…but who’s to say what or where.George: I’d be happy to escape London ASAP but don’t have any immediate plans to go anywhere.Or who knows? I might even start saving some money elsewhere…And have you thought about buying a place?Miranda: I lived at home for so long with the express purpose of saving for my own place. I still haven’t given up hope although I’m starting to wonder if it wouldn’t be more expedient to just buy somewhere outside of London.My dad kept nagging me to buy somewhere in Barking a few years ago and I scoffed at him – why would I want a place even further out than my parents?Now, of course, they’re saying that Barking is THE place to invest and prices have already doubled. I’m a fool.Now, let’s have a nosy around Miranda and George’s place…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying. If you fancy taking part, please email whatirent@metro. You\u0027ll need to have pictures taken of your kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom, plus a few photos of you in your room. Make sure you get permission for your housemates!You\u0027ll also need to be okay with sharing how much you\u0027re paying for rent, as that\u0027s pretty important.

The kids can’t play outside in nice weather, because that’s when it’s worst. We can’t have people over for barbecues because it’s embarrassing. Who wants to sit outside in those conditions?’A very good question and one that he has been putting to Linden Homes, the estate’s developer, for the past 18 months.Mr Buller claims that when he bought the property he was never informed about what lurked beneath his lawn nor shown any drainage or sewage plans.The property was still a ‘building site’ when he first viewed it, and he says he felt under pressure to rush the purchase.‘We made an offer of £700,000 and it was accepted, but we were told we had to complete within two-and-a-half weeks if we wanted the deal at that price. The day I moved in, they were only just laying the grass as I pulled up.’It was not until a month later that Mr Buller spotted manhole covers on his front lawn.Linden Homes disputes his version of events and the two sides are now at loggerheads. Mr Buller has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estate and threatening legal action against Linden Homes.While his behaviour may seem extreme, Linden is not the only builder to come in for criticism. Pressure to fulfil government targets for building new homes has resulted in floods of complaints from customers. Problems include bouncing floors, leaks, missing insulation, poor drainage and unfinished gardens — as well as some cases of appalling customer service.Homeowner is mocked after putting his property on Rightmove¿...Divorcing naked gardeners are forced to drop price of their...Share this articleThis time last year one company, Bovis, was singled out for particular criticism. After it was forced to apologise, it set aside £10 million to pay for repairs and promised to cut back from building 6,000 homes a year to 3,500.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), the industry’s representative body, admitted that pressure to build new homes quickly had resulted in short-term problems. But it claims a corner has been turned and customer satisfaction is on the rise.Others are far from convinced. Across social media, groups charting the complaints of buyers against major construction firms run to thousands of members.They continue to highlight poor build quality and say that trying to get problems sorted is a constant battle, accusing builders of using delaying tactics and legal threats to keep them quiet.The situation has prompted urgent calls for a dedicated ombudsman to be set up to give more protection to buyers.‘We are very concerned,’ says Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the HomeOwners Alliance. ‘Problems with new-builds are one of our top issues — and things aren’t getting better.‘People think that, like buying a car or a toaster, everything is going to be perfect but the reality can be quite different. The Government knows there’s a significant housing shortage and is imploring developers to build quickly. Quality, it seems, has taken a back seat.’Housebuilding has certainly spiked. Output last year, stimulated by the Government’s Help To Buy initiative, was up 74 per cent compared with four years ago. A Government target of 300,000 new-build properties a year is now within the housebuilders’ sights.  Mr Buller spotted 11 manhole covers on the front lawn. He has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estateBut with this rush to build has come an increase in complaints.While the industry points to the fact that the latest survey of new buyers shows that 86 per cent ‘would recommend their builder to a friend’, others highlight the significant minority who would not. Again, the industry insists it is inevitable there will be faults, but that these get quickly sorted.‘When building something as complex as a new house, using multiple tradespeople, in all weathers, it’s inevitable there are some, usually minor, flaws, such as paint drips or an uneven door,’ says a spokesman for the HBF.‘Builders typically encourage new buyers to produce a list of snags in order to ensure homeowners are fully satisfied with the property once they have had a chance to experience it more thoroughly.’Virtually all new homes are sold with a ten-year warranty. Most of these are covered by the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK.If faults emerge in the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing them. If there is a dispute, the warranty company adjudicates between the two parties.As Bovis has discovered, failure to deal with these complaints can quickly tarnish a reputation.It was the only national builder awarded two stars out of five in the HBF annual customer satisfaction survey for the year ending September 2017. A two-star rating means that between 30 and 40 per cent of customers would not recommend the builder to a friend. Since then it claims to have turned things around.‘We have made huge changes to our build quality and customer service and have transformed Bovis Homes,’ a spokesman says.But, over on the Facebook page of the Bovis Homes ‘victims’ group, a different picture emerges.Dave Howard, the administrator for the 2,500-strong group, says new people join every week. Many tell him they have given up complaining because of the number of times they have been fobbed off.‘Dealing with Bovis customer service is like hitting your head against a brick wall,’ he says.One dissatisfied customer is 48-year-old Phil Hutchinson, a lecturer in philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University.At the end of November 2016, he and his partner purchased a £229,000 three-bed townhouse on a development in Sandbach, Cheshire. After moving in, a long list of faults quickly emerged.These included problems with the shower’s drain hot and cold taps wrongly connected a faulty washing machine an oven without a seal that caused the adjoining kitchen units to become scorched and faulty French doors.‘One of the first things we noticed was the stairs,’ he says. ‘We had nails coming through the carpet so we were all bleeding from our feet as we walked up and down.’Complaints to Bovis led to a steady stream of workmen coming to the house. They were all sub-contractors.‘They told us how it worked. People who fit the stairs, that’s all they do. People who do the plastering, that’s all they do.‘So the only person who has responsibility from beginning to end is the site manager.’As more problems emerged, Mr Hutchinson engaged the services of a ‘snagging’ company. It identified more than 180 items that needed rectifying.Ever since, he has been battling with Bovis to get them fixed. As with the original work, the repairs are contracted out. Workmen often leave without achieving anything.He explains: ‘Three damaged internal doors were identified. A year on, only one door has been replaced and that was last week. Every time they come, either the doors earmarked for our house have disappeared, or the doors are more damaged than those they are replacing, or the doors aren’t the right specification. That has happened on seven occasions.’There are also ‘discussions’ about fixing the bouncing floors. These flex, says Mr Hutchinson, because Bovis used joists spaced at 600mm rather than 400mm.‘You walk across the front room and the TV will rock backwards and forwards. In the bedroom, toiletries rattle on the bedside table.’ Most recently, workmen visited the house to replace a damaged kitchen worksurface. When they removed it they discovered a huge hole in the plasterwork in the wall behind from which the upstairs plumbing and pipework emerged.          Thomas, Rhian, Mark, and Holly Buller outside their home, which has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the family and the developers, Linden HomesNot only is it ‘shoddy workmanship’ but Mr Hutchinson is concerned that it could be a fire risk, funnelling any fire upstairs.‘It’s been appalling,’ he says. ‘I can’t believe in the UK, where we have all these checks and balances, that you have no protection when it comes to the most expensive purchase of your life.’A spokesman for Bovis says it is committed to improving its business and is focusing on its subcontractors — ‘working only with the very best and boosting our engagement with them’.He adds: ‘We apologise to any customer who, like Mr Hutchinson, did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are committed to putting things right.‘In those rare instances where things might be disputed, we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues. We are committed to meeting our obligations in these instances.’One of those forced to involve the NHBC is 43-year-old Victoria Sheader from Stone, Staffordshire. She and her partner purchased a new four-bedroom home from Taylor Wimpey last December.They were particularly taken by the fact that it had a sunny south-facing garden.According to the plans they were shown, a drainage system had been installed beneath it.‘Within weeks we noticed that wherever you trod in the back garden, it filled up with water,’ says Miss Sheader, who works in the financial industry.After digging exploratory holes in the garden, she claims they found a problem with the drainage.But attempts to get Taylor Wimpey to fix the problem — including more than 60 emails and phone calls — have failed. In the end, it was agreed that the NHBC should investigate.After a site visit last week, it concluded that it was up to the builder to carry out drainage works to prevent waterlogging.Miss Sheader is still waiting for a response from Taylor Wimpey.‘It is a beautiful house in a really nice area, but you can hardly ever go outside — it is so disheartening,’ she says. ‘I expected that buying a new-build house would be exciting. Instead, I wish I’d never bought it. It has been a nightmare.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We deliver thousands of high-quality homes across the UK, but there are occasions where we do not meet the high standards that we set ourselves. We apologise for the issues that Ms Sheader has experienced and we are fully committed to resolving these.‘Drainage issues with the garden will be fixed as soon as the scope of works have been agreed with the NHBC and Miss Sheader.’Other examples of continuing problems with quality and customer service are not difficult to find. Three days before Christmas, Bryan Don paid £340,000 to Morris Homes for a new-build home in Garston, Liverpool.But on the day he moved in with his partner and their son he says he found 154 faults.Issues identified by the 42-year-old project manager included a water leak and no grass laid in the back garden. The wardrobe doors wouldn’t shut once clothes were inside — a niggle, yes, but a deeply frustrating one.Mr Don says: ‘It was meant to be a dream home. We walked in and our dreams were spoiled.’A spokesperson for Morris Homes says: ‘As a private housebuilder of more than 70 years’ standing we take the quality of our homes very seriously and we consistently achieve high approval ratings.‘On this occasion we relaxed our strict inspection procedures to accommodate our purchaser’s desire to move in for Christmas. It was accepted that there would be minor post-completion remedials which the purchaser accepted. The images recently reported in no way reflect the property on the day of occupation.’As for Mr Buller’s issues with his sewage plant, a satisfactory resolution looks some way away.A spokesperson for Linden Homes says that when the Bullers purchased their home it was in a ‘virtually finished state’ and that they had requested an early legal completion. She says the price they paid ‘reflects the overall amenity of the plot’.She adds that the manhole covers on the plot would have been ‘clearly visible’ at the time the property was reserved.She says: ‘Mr and Mrs Buller have complained of a “sewage odour” to the rear of their property. There are no foul sewers to the rear associated with the Heathlands development.‘There are however existing foul and surface water sewers, which are the subject of imminent upgrade works by Thames Water, following complaints of unpleasant smells from residents. We have offered to commission an air quality assessment to establish the source of any odours around the property.‘In the unlikely event that the survey indicates that odours from the pump station exceed acceptable levels, we will undertake any necessary works required.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/23/4B7E48E700000578-0-image-a-17_1524783490880.jpg","title":"TSB closed branches early weekend","story":"    TSB closed some of its branches early over the weekend and turned off the lights to avoid having to deal with irate customers, it has been claimedHalf of its customers were still locked out of their online accounts last night – ten days after the bank began an ill-fated systems upgrade. Many of the 1.9million customers affected have been unable to make bank transfer payments, meaning vital bills have gone unpaid.TSB’s problems stem from a failed switch-over from the IT system of its old owner Lloyds Banking Group to one owned by its Spanish parent company Sabadell.TSB chief says the bank\u0027s IT chaos is bringing company to...One million TSB customers are STILL locked out of their...Share this articleThe bank provoked more fury as branches closed early on Saturday – the first day many workers were able to visit a branch since problems started.Branches in Hull, Lincoln, Clifton in Nottingham, Greenock, Falkirk and Elgin in Scotland were reported to have shut early.TSB in Hull closed at 1pm on Saturday when it usually shuts at 4pm.The branch then directed customers to its nearest branches 46 miles away in Doncaster or Retford in Nottinghamshire, which is 65 miles away.

In a nationally televised address, Netanyahu said Israel recently uncovered 55,000 documents and 183 CDs of information from Iran\u0027s \u0027nuclear archives\u0027Mr Netanyahu accused Iran of having a secret plan called ‘Project Amad’, whose goal is to produce five ten-kiloton nuclear weapons.This unverified claim will of course have been music to the ears of Donald Trump and the anti-Iran hawks the President has surrounded himself with in the White House.Even before this dramatically theatrical display from Israel, Mr Trump appeared determined to scrap the controversial nuclear deal next month, because he sees it as being fatally flawed. The deal is still strongly backed by Britain, the EU, Russia, China and the UN-sponsored watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency. All remain adamant that inspections show Iran has and continues to abide by its principles.Indeed, during a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela Merkel.          The Israeli leader said that the \u0027atomic archive\u0027 where Iran kept its files was in the Shorabad District of the capital, TehranBut is Mr Trump listening more closely to his old friend Mr Netanyahu?What we do know is that, as the deadline nears for Mr Trump’s decision on whether to re-ratify the nuclear deal, unprecedented threats and counter-threats of death and destruction are being hurled between Tehran and Tel Aviv.British government says it has \u0027never been naive\u0027 about...Share this articleIn the past few weeks, each has promised to destroy the other’s major cities if threatened, raising fears that the proxy war they have been waging in Syria may soon explode into a direct military confrontation.We should remember that over the past few decades Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly, but erroneously, suggested that Iran is just months away from declaring it has developed a nuclear weapon. Still, it is easy to see why he is so paranoid. Since the revolution in 1979 brought the Shia Islam mullahs to power, the Tehran regime has proudly promoted the destruction of Israel as its top foreign policy objective.    During a visit to the White House last week, French president Emmanuel Macron urged Mr Trump to stick to the agreement – echoing similar pleas by Theresa May and Angela MerkelWorse for Israel, the civil war in Syria has resulted in thousands of Iranian fighters joining thousands more militia men from Hezbollah, Iran’s main regional Shia ally, which has already fought numerous wars with Israel.Their ostensible aim was to help Assad fight Islamic State and other Islamist rebel groups, but that brutal experience means they are now battle-hardened, armed to the hilt and entrenched right on the Jewish state’s border.Until now, Russia – which is allied with Assad, Iran and Hezbollah, but also has warm relations with Israel – has played a delicate diplomatic balancing act, backing Israel’s enemies while turning a blind eye to the Jewish state attacks against them in Syria.          Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run outBut Russian leader Vladimir Putin recently signalled his patience with Mr Netanyahu had run out, and he has promised to deliver the advanced S-300 air defence missile system to Assad to help him defend against such aerial attacks. Israel responded by saying that any such system would be destroyed before it could become operational.It is easy to see, then, why the price of oil is soaring on the back of Mr Netanyahu’s claims yesterday. It’s a sign that the international markets are afraid supply will be disrupted by strife and conflict in the region.The great fear for diplomats around the world is that, if Mr Trump does decide to withdraw from the nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions, Israel will launch unilateral strikes against what it says are Iran’s nuclear facilities. That would almost certainly provoke a devastating military response – not just from Tehran, but also its allies in Syria and Lebanon.And if that happens, it will take a massive effort of will to stop America and Russia coming to the aid of their allies – at which point the risks of a global conflict will rise sharply. Once again, the tinder box Middle East threatens to drag two of the world’s great powers to the edge of the abyss. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/23/4BB4DD1600000578-0-image-a-22_1525127609121.jpg","title":"Spotify music downloads reveal mood nation Bank England claim","story":"    Music downloaded from Spotify can give decision-makers an insight into consumer moods, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist‘Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence,’ he said, referring to an important monthly survey in the United States.‘And why stop at music?

And as the financial details of the merger were revealed early yesterday, my phone rang off the hook.Sainsbury’s most senior executives were clearly fearful that regulators and politicians will be more concerned about potential harm to consumers and suppliers than with the positive impact for investors.I was assured by one of the architects of the deal that it must be a ‘win-win’ situation.Since 85 per cent of what the big grocers buy comes from 100 big suppliers, the deal would give the Sainsbury’s-Asda conglomerate added muscle in its dealings.Astonishing moment Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the...Competition watchdog will probe £12bn merger of Sainsbury\u0027s...Share this article    Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe (pictured) wants to win consumer support with the promise of ‘lower prices by 10 per cent on many of the products customers buy regularly’This is not quite true, however, because Walmart will be the biggest shareholder in the new Sainsbury’s-Asda set-up with 42 per cent of the shares and a third of the votes in the company. There is always excitement when a major merger is announced, but experience tells me that when the public-relations machine is running at full tilt, one should never allow spin to outweigh basic economics.Consumers shouldn’t kid themselves that Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe’s 10 per cent price reductions will necessarily mean an overall cut in the cost in a shopping basket across the huge range of branded, own label and fresh produce goods offered by the new group.Other concerns were aired in Parliament yesterday, where MPs expressed fears not only about job security, but also on whether supermarkets would close in their areas.Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long run. The thinking is that, if there are only Sainsbury’s and Asda stores in a given area, they could effectively operate a monopoly and so one would have to be sold off to a rival supermarket chain.Analysis suggests that, as a result of such overlap, as many as 75 Asda stores will have to be disposed of if this merger is to have any chance of winning approval.Such a large estment could undermine the financial rationale for the deal, and could take years to complete at a time when the whole retail sector is under stress. It is suggested that the new merged company will seek to keep the Sainsbury and Asda brands separate, with the former maintaining its focus on quality, and Asda continuing to push cheaper own-brand products which will compete with the upstart discounters like Lidl and Aldi.But Sainsbury’s tried this with Dutch discounter Netto, and ended up losing £20million after having to close a series of stores where the brands had been sited together.    Sainsbury’s says there are no plans to close stores, but the company will seek ‘operational efficiencies’ of £500million – which will surely result in job losses in the long runLargely the brainchild of Mike Coupe at Sainsbury’s and his ex-colleague Dave Cheesewright at Asda, this merger has been two years in the making. Both firms have been trying to figure out how to deal with the huge global threat from Amazon, which arguably has the best logistics, warehousing and delivery technology, as well as almost unlimited financial resources.Amazon is challenging Asda owner Walmart in the US with the purchase of bricks-and-mortar retail firm Whole Foods Market, and starting to make incursions in the UK, too. Sainsbury’s argues it is in a strong position to integrate Asda because both companies have embraced the best of new technology.Be that as it may, we should heed the lessons of last week’s disastrous IT meltdown at the TSB – that technological change can be chaotic if companies get it wrong.Sainsbury’s is still digesting IT and distribution changes that came with the purchase of Argos owner Home Retail Group two years ago.The Sainsbury’s-Asda merger gives the impression of being a sensible deal designed to create a new leader in British shopping. But like many big mergers, it is a roll of the dice designed in part to cover-up grave shortcomings in the strategy of the managements concerned. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/16/4B92989300000578-0-image-m-116_1524758274646.jpg","title":"Land value levy cost families 10 000 year","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, who has praised the Labour Land Campaign (LLC) which calls for a new levy based on the value of land a home is built onPub angers community by putting parking meters in car park...Council unveils plan to restrict foreign languages on...Share this articleLLC suggests charging as much as £96,534 a year for a three-bedroom home in the richest part of London. Residents of Band D homes in parts of Manchester would pay £11,239 per year and those in Bristol £9,567.Critics warn it would hit London and the South-East the hardest, putting at risk lower-income households and those who bought their ex-council houses at a discount under the right-to-buy scheme.The LLC is not affiliated to the Labour Party, and a party spokesman said a land value tax was not Labour policy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/00/4BB3602000000578-0-image-m-18_1525131196230.jpg","title":"Pharmacy grade Xanax sold openly Instagram","story":"    Reporters discovered that a pharmacy-grade version of the highly-addictive drug was being sold on InstagramOne pharmacist in central London, Anatolijus Kostiukevicius, sold Xanax and the highly addictive painkiller tramadol to an undercover reporter without a prescription.

This is what happened to me.I can trace its beginnings to my older sister’s hen do, surrounded by her beautiful friends. They all had perfect jobs, perfect skin, perfect bodies. I’d just finished drama school, was in debt and living with my parents, and had no plan.Later, chatting to a friend, I said I wasn’t feeling good: bloated, foggy brain, generally ‘bleugh’. She recommended a ‘clean living’ book. ‘It will change your life,’ she said. ‘It teaches you how to be kind to your body, your skin, your weight, your mind, your energy levels, everything.’ An easy sell.I was a healthy size 8-10.

It was around this time I downloaded the social media app Instagram. I started posting about my progress online and got endless compliments. I finally felt I was in control.And I was supported by a whole community. Bloggers such as Deliciously Ella, Honestly Healthy, Clean Eating Alice — they were all there to inspire me. The weight dropped off. It became my religion.Then, a theatre show I’d created and acted in transferred to Australia. This is where my ‘clean’ lifestyle went up a gear. My days consisted of exercise first thing, brunch (so I didn’t have to eat breakfast and lunch) of avocado and eggs, and later a vegetable-filled dinner.  Daniella was inspired by bloggers such as Deliciously Ella (left) and Clean Eating Alice (right) When I came back to London, I couldn’t get off the wellness treadmill. I started ghost-writing for ‘clean living’ brands, developing recipes. I even launched a brand of granola.The job was the perfect way to retain total control: alcohol was banned from events, every menu was free from sugar and gluten, and detailed descriptions of exercise routines were accepted as dinner party conversation.After about six months of eating clean, my sister and mum voiced their concerns to me, but I ignored them.Even when a wellness expert I was writing for took me to one side and said my lifestyle was getting ‘excessive’ . . . I didn’t listen.It was only in November 2016 that I began to reassess. My sister announced she was pregnant — it was a sharp wake-up call reminding me that I hadn’t had a period in over two years.  Daniella moved to Australia where her eating disorder worsenedI went to the gynaecologist who said that although my weight was within the ‘normal’ range, my oestrogen level was non-existent. He explained that to conserve energy, my body had stopped releasing the hormone.I now know that I was in the grip of orthorexia an eating disorder characterised as an unhealthy obsession with healthy living. The doctor didn’t diagnose this specifically, because it is not yet officially recognised by medical bodies.But once I had explained my lifestyle to him, it was clear my disorder was far from rare. ‘If you were a plant,’ he said, ‘you’d be withered and on your way out. Your body hasn’t been nourished in a long time. You need to learn to love yourself again. What are you scared of?’I hated the question. I was scared of the thoughts in my head, scared of being a failure.I knew I had to change if I wanted to bring my periods back. I felt angry at the wellness world. I’d spent so much time, money and headspace obsessively following the rules, only for them to make me sick.          Daniella would eat just avocado and eggs for brunch and vegetables for dinnerThe gynaecologist suggested therapy, but I wasn’t ready for deep reflection (and the NHS waiting list was long), so I turned to a group I found on Facebook called ‘No period, now what?’ Here, I found hundreds of women like me. Many had fallen into orthorexic habits.Their advice was simple: ‘Let go’. No rules, no recipes, no detoxes, no cleanses, no selfies.I started with small, incremental steps. I’d miss one day of exercise, I’d have porridge for breakfast instead of a smoothie. Then, I’d let friends choose where we went for dinner. I ate carbs, real carbs.I hated seeing my body change. My hard-earned abs turned to soft rolls. I had bursts of rage and deep sadness. I felt like a failure, mentally and physically.Each month I went back to the fertility clinic for blood tests. I’d be surrounded by women who were hoping to get pregnant I was just hoping to feel like a woman again.It took six weeks before my oestrogen level rose. After four months my period came back, just in time for opening night of my new show, Hear Me Raw.I wanted the production to reveal the dirty truth behind the clean living movement.Because despite how it might have looked on Instagram, I had never felt less well. The so-called wellness industry isn’t really selling wellness, is it? It’s the diet industry dressed up in candy-coloured phrases of empowerment.

Mr Eades has worked for the BBC for decades and presented coverage of the construction of the Channel TunnelMr Eades previously presented The World Today segment on the BBC World Service and The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4.He also runs his own company Allday Media which produces sports and conference events.Tim Willcox:           Mr Willcox is a former ITN arts correspondent who joined the news team shortly before the 911 attacksMr Willcox is a familiar face on both the BBC and ITV, having previously worked for ITN for many years, including during the 911 coverage.After joining the BBC he became an anchor on the news channel and presented bulletins on BBC One.More recently he has also become well known for his work in the field, covering natural disasters such as the 2011 Japanese tsunami and high profile accidents including the 2010 Chilean mining crisis where 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days.Mr Willcox has also produced a number of special features and documentaries on Princess Diana for the BBC as well as Channel 4 and Channel Five.                         BBC put presenters on an \u0027elegant form of zero hours pay\u0027, court hears"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/4BB26C7C00000578-5677433-In_a_toe_curling_GMB_interview_shadow_home_secretary_Diane_Abbot-a-50_1525161787288.jpg","title":"Shadow cabinet minister defies Corbyn ID cards","story":"    Shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner told the BBC\u0027s Newsnight that the government needed a better way to \u0027establish who is here legally\u0027          In a toe-curling GMB interview yesterday, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott dodged as she was pressed to spell out whether she would take action to expel illegal immigrantsIn a toe-curling interview with Piers Morgan on ITV\u0027s GMB programme, she said she did not want an amnesty – but also rejected kicking them all out. Mr Gardiner raised the idea of ID cards as he was pressed on how Labour would avoid a repeat of the Windrush fiasco.  “You need to try and have a system that can establish who is here legally,” he told BBC\u0027s Newsnight. Asked if he was supporting ID cards, Mr Gardiner said: “It was a policy the Labour Party had in 2009. Sajid Javid arrives for first Cabinet meeting since Rudd\u0027s...On his first day in a new job, Mr Javid was free of...Share this article\u0027Theresa May when she became home secretary actually abolished that policy. But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary. Only around 15,000 cards were ever distributed.A law abolishing ID cards and the national identity register was the first to come out of the Home Office during the coalition government.At the time Mrs May said it would ‘begin the process of reversing the erosion of civil liberties and restoring freedoms’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/09/04D4EA3F000007D0-5677485-image-a-3_1525163198148.jpg","title":"Jamie Oliver blames BREXIT blowing government crackdown childhood obesity","story":"    Jamie Oliver said the EU referendum derailed the drive for healthy eating reforms as he demanded Theresa May takes tougher action (file picture)          Oliver is giving evidence to MPs alongside fellow chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall (pictured) later todayLast week the PM described the UK\u0027s existing plans as \u0027ambitious\u0027 and \u0027world-leading\u0027, but added that further action has not been ruled out \u0027if the right results aren\u0027t seen\u0027.Oliver pushed for former prime minister David Cameron to introduce reforms to tackle childhood obesity but accused successor Mrs May of halting progress.The Commons session comes ahead of the next chapter of the Government\u0027s Childhood Obesity: A Plan For Action, which is expected this year.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027I worked with Mr Cameron within his group to formulate chapter one, which of course, with Brexit and everything that happened got blown up.Amber who?

They were at one end of the room and I walked to the opposite side to document how I treated them and their medical history.\u0027I squatted down next to an empty bed and began documenting. But I felt Dr Parthasarathy come behind me and felt him touch the space between my legs, over the clothing. His hand went underneath me as I was squatting down.\u0027He touched me with one hand. I was wearing trousers and my green tunic top. I was aware the mother and her son were down the other end of the ward and I know that sort of behaviour wasn\u0027t acceptable and shouldn\u0027t be occurring in the A\u0026ampE department, so I didn\u0027t want to make a scene.\u0027I didn\u0027t say anything, I was in shock.

He always asked if I had any rude pictures.\u0027After that I took six months off work on health grounds but I felt like nobody would believe me. It wasn\u0027t until May 2016 when Colleague B asked what I thought of him. We talked and she said she had similar experiences of him. She didn\u0027t look right, she looked upset and he was in the same shift as her.\u0027She told me about an incident a few days before.

The kids can’t play outside in nice weather, because that’s when it’s worst. We can’t have people over for barbecues because it’s embarrassing. Who wants to sit outside in those conditions?’A very good question and one that he has been putting to Linden Homes, the estate’s developer, for the past 18 months.Mr Buller claims that when he bought the property he was never informed about what lurked beneath his lawn nor shown any drainage or sewage plans.The property was still a ‘building site’ when he first viewed it, and he says he felt under pressure to rush the purchase.‘We made an offer of £700,000 and it was accepted, but we were told we had to complete within two-and-a-half weeks if we wanted the deal at that price. The day I moved in, they were only just laying the grass as I pulled up.’It was not until a month later that Mr Buller spotted manhole covers on his front lawn.Linden Homes disputes his version of events and the two sides are now at loggerheads. Mr Buller has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estate and threatening legal action against Linden Homes.While his behaviour may seem extreme, Linden is not the only builder to come in for criticism. Pressure to fulfil government targets for building new homes has resulted in floods of complaints from customers. Problems include bouncing floors, leaks, missing insulation, poor drainage and unfinished gardens — as well as some cases of appalling customer service.Homeowner is mocked after putting his property on Rightmove¿...Divorcing naked gardeners are forced to drop price of their...Share this articleThis time last year one company, Bovis, was singled out for particular criticism. After it was forced to apologise, it set aside £10 million to pay for repairs and promised to cut back from building 6,000 homes a year to 3,500.The Home Builders Federation (HBF), the industry’s representative body, admitted that pressure to build new homes quickly had resulted in short-term problems. But it claims a corner has been turned and customer satisfaction is on the rise.Others are far from convinced. Across social media, groups charting the complaints of buyers against major construction firms run to thousands of members.They continue to highlight poor build quality and say that trying to get problems sorted is a constant battle, accusing builders of using delaying tactics and legal threats to keep them quiet.The situation has prompted urgent calls for a dedicated ombudsman to be set up to give more protection to buyers.‘We are very concerned,’ says Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the HomeOwners Alliance. ‘Problems with new-builds are one of our top issues — and things aren’t getting better.‘People think that, like buying a car or a toaster, everything is going to be perfect but the reality can be quite different. The Government knows there’s a significant housing shortage and is imploring developers to build quickly. Quality, it seems, has taken a back seat.’Housebuilding has certainly spiked. Output last year, stimulated by the Government’s Help To Buy initiative, was up 74 per cent compared with four years ago. A Government target of 300,000 new-build properties a year is now within the housebuilders’ sights.  Mr Buller spotted 11 manhole covers on the front lawn. He has resorted to direct action, hanging banners outside his home to warn off potential buyers on the estateBut with this rush to build has come an increase in complaints.While the industry points to the fact that the latest survey of new buyers shows that 86 per cent ‘would recommend their builder to a friend’, others highlight the significant minority who would not. Again, the industry insists it is inevitable there will be faults, but that these get quickly sorted.‘When building something as complex as a new house, using multiple tradespeople, in all weathers, it’s inevitable there are some, usually minor, flaws, such as paint drips or an uneven door,’ says a spokesman for the HBF.‘Builders typically encourage new buyers to produce a list of snags in order to ensure homeowners are fully satisfied with the property once they have had a chance to experience it more thoroughly.’Virtually all new homes are sold with a ten-year warranty. Most of these are covered by the National House Building Council (NHBC), the standard-setting body and main home construction warranty provider for new-builds in the UK.If faults emerge in the first two years, the builder is responsible for fixing them. If there is a dispute, the warranty company adjudicates between the two parties.As Bovis has discovered, failure to deal with these complaints can quickly tarnish a reputation.It was the only national builder awarded two stars out of five in the HBF annual customer satisfaction survey for the year ending September 2017. A two-star rating means that between 30 and 40 per cent of customers would not recommend the builder to a friend. Since then it claims to have turned things around.‘We have made huge changes to our build quality and customer service and have transformed Bovis Homes,’ a spokesman says.But, over on the Facebook page of the Bovis Homes ‘victims’ group, a different picture emerges.Dave Howard, the administrator for the 2,500-strong group, says new people join every week. Many tell him they have given up complaining because of the number of times they have been fobbed off.‘Dealing with Bovis customer service is like hitting your head against a brick wall,’ he says.One dissatisfied customer is 48-year-old Phil Hutchinson, a lecturer in philosophy at Manchester Metropolitan University.At the end of November 2016, he and his partner purchased a £229,000 three-bed townhouse on a development in Sandbach, Cheshire. After moving in, a long list of faults quickly emerged.These included problems with the shower’s drain hot and cold taps wrongly connected a faulty washing machine an oven without a seal that caused the adjoining kitchen units to become scorched and faulty French doors.‘One of the first things we noticed was the stairs,’ he says. ‘We had nails coming through the carpet so we were all bleeding from our feet as we walked up and down.’Complaints to Bovis led to a steady stream of workmen coming to the house. They were all sub-contractors.‘They told us how it worked. People who fit the stairs, that’s all they do. People who do the plastering, that’s all they do.‘So the only person who has responsibility from beginning to end is the site manager.’As more problems emerged, Mr Hutchinson engaged the services of a ‘snagging’ company. It identified more than 180 items that needed rectifying.Ever since, he has been battling with Bovis to get them fixed. As with the original work, the repairs are contracted out. Workmen often leave without achieving anything.He explains: ‘Three damaged internal doors were identified. A year on, only one door has been replaced and that was last week. Every time they come, either the doors earmarked for our house have disappeared, or the doors are more damaged than those they are replacing, or the doors aren’t the right specification. That has happened on seven occasions.’There are also ‘discussions’ about fixing the bouncing floors. These flex, says Mr Hutchinson, because Bovis used joists spaced at 600mm rather than 400mm.‘You walk across the front room and the TV will rock backwards and forwards. In the bedroom, toiletries rattle on the bedside table.’ Most recently, workmen visited the house to replace a damaged kitchen worksurface. When they removed it they discovered a huge hole in the plasterwork in the wall behind from which the upstairs plumbing and pipework emerged.          Thomas, Rhian, Mark, and Holly Buller outside their home, which has been the subject of an ongoing dispute between the family and the developers, Linden HomesNot only is it ‘shoddy workmanship’ but Mr Hutchinson is concerned that it could be a fire risk, funnelling any fire upstairs.‘It’s been appalling,’ he says. ‘I can’t believe in the UK, where we have all these checks and balances, that you have no protection when it comes to the most expensive purchase of your life.’A spokesman for Bovis says it is committed to improving its business and is focusing on its subcontractors — ‘working only with the very best and boosting our engagement with them’.He adds: ‘We apologise to any customer who, like Mr Hutchinson, did not move into the home they deserved in the past, but we are committed to putting things right.‘In those rare instances where things might be disputed, we welcome the involvement of external agencies, such as the NHBC, to objectively assess the issues. We are committed to meeting our obligations in these instances.’One of those forced to involve the NHBC is 43-year-old Victoria Sheader from Stone, Staffordshire. She and her partner purchased a new four-bedroom home from Taylor Wimpey last December.They were particularly taken by the fact that it had a sunny south-facing garden.According to the plans they were shown, a drainage system had been installed beneath it.‘Within weeks we noticed that wherever you trod in the back garden, it filled up with water,’ says Miss Sheader, who works in the financial industry.After digging exploratory holes in the garden, she claims they found a problem with the drainage.But attempts to get Taylor Wimpey to fix the problem — including more than 60 emails and phone calls — have failed. In the end, it was agreed that the NHBC should investigate.After a site visit last week, it concluded that it was up to the builder to carry out drainage works to prevent waterlogging.Miss Sheader is still waiting for a response from Taylor Wimpey.‘It is a beautiful house in a really nice area, but you can hardly ever go outside — it is so disheartening,’ she says. ‘I expected that buying a new-build house would be exciting. Instead, I wish I’d never bought it. It has been a nightmare.’A Taylor Wimpey spokesman says: ‘We deliver thousands of high-quality homes across the UK, but there are occasions where we do not meet the high standards that we set ourselves. We apologise for the issues that Ms Sheader has experienced and we are fully committed to resolving these.‘Drainage issues with the garden will be fixed as soon as the scope of works have been agreed with the NHBC and Miss Sheader.’Other examples of continuing problems with quality and customer service are not difficult to find. Three days before Christmas, Bryan Don paid £340,000 to Morris Homes for a new-build home in Garston, Liverpool.But on the day he moved in with his partner and their son he says he found 154 faults.Issues identified by the 42-year-old project manager included a water leak and no grass laid in the back garden. The wardrobe doors wouldn’t shut once clothes were inside — a niggle, yes, but a deeply frustrating one.Mr Don says: ‘It was meant to be a dream home. We walked in and our dreams were spoiled.’A spokesperson for Morris Homes says: ‘As a private housebuilder of more than 70 years’ standing we take the quality of our homes very seriously and we consistently achieve high approval ratings.‘On this occasion we relaxed our strict inspection procedures to accommodate our purchaser’s desire to move in for Christmas. It was accepted that there would be minor post-completion remedials which the purchaser accepted. The images recently reported in no way reflect the property on the day of occupation.’As for Mr Buller’s issues with his sewage plant, a satisfactory resolution looks some way away.A spokesperson for Linden Homes says that when the Bullers purchased their home it was in a ‘virtually finished state’ and that they had requested an early legal completion. She says the price they paid ‘reflects the overall amenity of the plot’.She adds that the manhole covers on the plot would have been ‘clearly visible’ at the time the property was reserved.She says: ‘Mr and Mrs Buller have complained of a “sewage odour” to the rear of their property.

This is what happened to me.I can trace its beginnings to my older sister’s hen do, surrounded by her beautiful friends. They all had perfect jobs, perfect skin, perfect bodies. I’d just finished drama school, was in debt and living with my parents, and had no plan.Later, chatting to a friend, I said I wasn’t feeling good: bloated, foggy brain, generally ‘bleugh’. She recommended a ‘clean living’ book. ‘It will change your life,’ she said. ‘It teaches you how to be kind to your body, your skin, your weight, your mind, your energy levels, everything.’ An easy sell.I was a healthy size 8-10.  Daniella posted flattering photos on social media, despite suffering from an eating disorderI’d been diagnosed with coeliac disease (an auto-immune condition where the body reacts to gluten) a few years earlier, so I had already cut gluten out of my diet, but otherwise I enjoyed food and ate a varied diet.But the book insisted I cut out dairy, then sugar and then meat and grains.Then, it promised, I would be clean. I would feel better.Why getting a dog is so good for you: People raised in...Should you be worried about E. coli in your lunchtime salad?...Which tea to drink to make you healthier, happier and...A stick-on skin patch for hay fever that blocks the release...Share this articleI joined my local gym, too — and along with my new diet, it gave me a much sought-after routine. It was around this time I downloaded the social media app Instagram. I started posting about my progress online and got endless compliments. I finally felt I was in control.And I was supported by a whole community. Bloggers such as Deliciously Ella, Honestly Healthy, Clean Eating Alice — they were all there to inspire me. The weight dropped off. It became my religion.Then, a theatre show I’d created and acted in transferred to Australia. This is where my ‘clean’ lifestyle went up a gear. My days consisted of exercise first thing, brunch (so I didn’t have to eat breakfast and lunch) of avocado and eggs, and later a vegetable-filled dinner.  Daniella was inspired by bloggers such as Deliciously Ella (left) and Clean Eating Alice (right) When I came back to London, I couldn’t get off the wellness treadmill. I started ghost-writing for ‘clean living’ brands, developing recipes. I even launched a brand of granola.The job was the perfect way to retain total control: alcohol was banned from events, every menu was free from sugar and gluten, and detailed descriptions of exercise routines were accepted as dinner party conversation.After about six months of eating clean, my sister and mum voiced their concerns to me, but I ignored them.Even when a wellness expert I was writing for took me to one side and said my lifestyle was getting ‘excessive’ . . . I didn’t listen.It was only in November 2016 that I began to reassess. My sister announced she was pregnant — it was a sharp wake-up call reminding me that I hadn’t had a period in over two years.  Daniella moved to Australia where her eating disorder worsenedI went to the gynaecologist who said that although my weight was within the ‘normal’ range, my oestrogen level was non-existent. He explained that to conserve energy, my body had stopped releasing the hormone.I now know that I was in the grip of orthorexia an eating disorder characterised as an unhealthy obsession with healthy living. The doctor didn’t diagnose this specifically, because it is not yet officially recognised by medical bodies.But once I had explained my lifestyle to him, it was clear my disorder was far from rare. ‘If you were a plant,’ he said, ‘you’d be withered and on your way out. Your body hasn’t been nourished in a long time. You need to learn to love yourself again. What are you scared of?’I hated the question. I was scared of the thoughts in my head, scared of being a failure.I knew I had to change if I wanted to bring my periods back. I felt angry at the wellness world. I’d spent so much time, money and headspace obsessively following the rules, only for them to make me sick.          Daniella would eat just avocado and eggs for brunch and vegetables for dinnerThe gynaecologist suggested therapy, but I wasn’t ready for deep reflection (and the NHS waiting list was long), so I turned to a group I found on Facebook called ‘No period, now what?’ Here, I found hundreds of women like me. Many had fallen into orthorexic habits.Their advice was simple: ‘Let go’. No rules, no recipes, no detoxes, no cleanses, no selfies.I started with small, incremental steps. I’d miss one day of exercise, I’d have porridge for breakfast instead of a smoothie. Then, I’d let friends choose where we went for dinner. I ate carbs, real carbs.I hated seeing my body change. My hard-earned abs turned to soft rolls. I had bursts of rage and deep sadness. I felt like a failure, mentally and physically.Each month I went back to the fertility clinic for blood tests. I’d be surrounded by women who were hoping to get pregnant I was just hoping to feel like a woman again.It took six weeks before my oestrogen level rose. After four months my period came back, just in time for opening night of my new show, Hear Me Raw.I wanted the production to reveal the dirty truth behind the clean living movement.Because despite how it might have looked on Instagram, I had never felt less well. The so-called wellness industry isn’t really selling wellness, is it? It’s the diet industry dressed up in candy-coloured phrases of empowerment. And it’s making us sick."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/07/4BB9305E00000578-5677157-image-m-6_1525157589966.jpg","title":"Adults children scream run TANK","story":"Footage captured the terrifying moment adults and children were  being run over by a tank during a Russian military festival - and survived          Two men and two children were thrown off the top of the T71 war machine after being taken for a ride at the event in St Petersburg          One man, Pyotr Nazarov, filmed himself as he toppled off the tank and was dragged under the caterpillar tracksThe T71 went up and down a small embankment at the Combat Steel festival in a city park.

The risk does not appear to have been explained to them.‘They were henceforth treated as freelancers and not as staff so they got none of the benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay, maternity leave, insurance or pension.’He told the court their contracts were essentially ‘no work, no pay’ and added Ms Gosling took unpaid maternity leave when pregnant with both her first and second children because her contract was ‘suspended’ by the broadcaster.Women like to watch other women being attacked, says...Share this articleThe BBC News Channel presenter, who was married to David Cameron’s former communications chief Sir Craig Oliver from 1996 to 2014, was told the broadcaster ‘would decide if and when it would have her back’.The court heard Ms Gosling, who has been with the broadcaster since 1999, was accidentally copied into an internal email which ‘put pressure on her’ to set up a PSC and said she would be given a job as producer rather than presenter at a lower fee if she refused.Meanwhile Mr Peacock told the court the BBC would not provide insurance for Mr Willcox when he reported from disaster zones, with the journalist covering major stories including the 2011 Japanese tsunami and the Chilean mining accident in 2010.Mr Peacock said: ‘If you are caught in a typhoon and you are injured you may hope the BBC send you a helicopter, but they have no obligation to do so.’          Ms Gosling joined the BBC in 1999 and the court heard she \u0027had to take unpaid maternity leave\u0027 when pregnantMs Gosling later moved to evening slots before taking the evening shift on the BBC News Channel from 2007 to 2013, and currently presents daytime slots.She has previously filled in on BBC Breakfast and has served as Friday presenter on the Victoria Derbyshire Programme on BBC2.Ms Gosling was married to David Cameron\u0027s former spin doctor Sir Craig Oliver between 1996 and 2014 and has three children with him.David Eades: Mr Eades has worked for the BBC in a variety of roles, having been with the broadcaster for decades.He was Channel Tunnel correspondent during its construction in the early 1990s and has also served as an Ireland and European correspondent.

But it would have given the government a way of knowing through those biometric ID cards who was here legally and who wasn’t.” Pushed again on whether he supported ID cards, Mr Gardiner replied: “We need to have much better ways of tracking people through the system.”Former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague today added his voice to calls for ID cards. “It would be worth thinking again about bringing in universal identity cards,” Lord Hague wrote in his Telegraph column. “We Conservatives were against this a decade ago, but times have moved on.” Yesterday Alan Johnson, and Charles Clarke, who both ran the Home Office under Labour in the 2000s, argued that biometric ID cards were the ‘best way to prove and so protect a citizen’s identity’.          Jeremy Corbyn, pictured on the local election campaign trail yesterday, voted against ID cards during the 2000s Ken Clarke, who was Tory Home Secretary in the early 1990s, also said ID cards would help deal with illegal immigration from Africa and the Middle East.However, it is understood Theresa May has ruled out bringing in such a scheme, which critics say would breach civil liberties.A Whitehall source said: ‘This Government is not going to introduce mandatory ID cards. It wasn’t the right policy when Labour first proposed it, and that remains the case.’When Mrs May first entered the Home Office, she oversaw the destruction of Labour’s identity card database, scuppering a scheme which at that stage was voluntary.

Prior to his appointment to the Vatican in 2014, he held senior positions within the Catholic church in Australia, including the archbishop of Sydney and the archbishop of Melbourne. He is Australia’s most senior Catholic, and he was once believed to be in the running to replace Pope Francis when he dies. Pell is now also the highest-ranking Catholic official in the world to be facing trial over historical sexual offence allegations.What has happened to him?In June, Pell was charged with historical sexual assault offences by Australian police in the state of Victoria. Pell’s legal representatives in Australia were served with the charges which relate to multiple complainants and offences alleged to have occurred in Victoria. From the moment the charges were delivered, Pell has strenuously denied all of the allegations.Pell took leave from the Vatican to return to Australia and face a committal hearing which began in March and ran for about four weeks in the Melbourne magistrates court before the magistrate Belinda Wallington. During such a hearing the magistrate needs to determine if there is enough evidence to order the defendant to stand trial on any of the charges. On Tuesday, Wallington handed down her decision, stating that Pell would face trial on half of the charges. She threw out the most serious due to credibility issues over witnesses. Other charges were withdrawn by the prosecution during the committal hearing. Pell has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges for which he will stand trial. That plea has now been formally recorded by the court.What can we say about the charges?Not much. Further details about the nature and number of charges cannot be reported for legal reasons. This has made reporting on the committal hearing difficult. However, it has also helped to protect complainants who gave evidence from being identified. The first days of the committal hearing, which began on 5 March, were closed to the media and the public while complainants gave evidence – a standard procedure for cases involving sexual offence allegations.What is the wider context of this story?Countries around the world have been holding inquiries into institutional child sexual abuse. In 2012, Australia’s then prime minister, Julia Gillard, ordered a formal inquiry into historical child sexual abuse within Australian institutions, with the Catholic church and its associated organisations coming under particular scrutiny.Pell was one of hundreds of people summoned to give evidence during public hearings held throughout Australia. He gave evidence to the commission in person and via videolink, and was questioned about the structure of the archdiocese of Melbourne.There had been no suggestion in these commission hearings that Pell was a perpetrator. The commission asked questions about whether he knew of any abuse and what he did to address it. This is because in 1996, while Pell was archbishop of Melbourne, he was approached by senior politicians, judges and officials who raised concerns about historical child sexual abuse by clergy and church personnel. More complainants were coming forward with their stories and historical charges were being laid. As a result, Pell established a scheme within the archdiocese of Melbourne to investigate such claims. This initiative was known as the Melbourne Response, and those in charge of it, including Pell, have been criticised by complainants for an inconsistent and inadequate response to claims.Pell also faced questioning by the royal commission about how the archdiocese of Melbourne responded to and investigated allegations of child sexual abuse within its institutions.What does it mean for the pope and the Catholic church?Pell took leave from his role as the Vatican’s secretary for the economy last year. His role, for which he was chosen by Pope Francis personally to turn around the Vatican’s finances, makes him the third most senior member of the Vatican hierarchy.A statement from the Vatican said Pell would remain on leave: “Last year, the Holy Father granted Cardinal Pell a leave of absence so he could defend himself from the accusations. The leave of absence is still in place.” Pope Francis is yet to comment on the most recent developments, but has previously said he would allow justice to take its course.The trial is likely to belong. Under Pell’s bail conditions he cannot leave the country. The trial will begin at 9am on 2 May for a first directions hearing, which is purely to go over administrative matters. Given his rank, media from around the world will be in attendance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9af8cc3e2e4c0151755be08a865458b8dd37df2/0_245_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94574c80749b35aa6e2b160c3f5ef2ba","title":"sainsburys mike coupe sings were in the money itv asda merger","story":"Mike Coupe filmed singing song from 42nd Street while waiting for interview with ITV about dealThe chief executive of Sainsbury’s has been filmed singing “We’re in the Money” on the same day he announced a blockbuster merger with Asda.Waiting to be interviewed by ITV, Mike Coupe started warbling one of the best-known songs from the musical 42nd Street.

But the Windrush affair is no mere scandal. What we have witnessed are the consequences of a Home Office culture that is rotten to the core – and it will take more than a single resignation and a subtle tweak in rhetoric to fix it.It is only right that Amber Rudd was compelled to resign. It’s one thing to get caught in a lie, but quite another to unconvincingly firm a fib to parliament, double down on the dishonesty to the public, and then subsequently get hung out to dry by your own correspondence. However, it is vital to note that her departure from the government’s front bench is due only to having “inadvertently” misled the Home Office select committee. The underlying causes behind the detention, exclusion from public life, and potential deportations of British citizens of colour went unremarked in Rudd’s resignation letter.I’m sure that Javid is perfectly sincere in his statement of affinity for the Windrush migrants. However, one is compelled to turn to his voting record in order to assess what this shift in tone might mean in policy terms.Furthermore, the phrase “compliant environment” is so far devoid of any meaningful content in policy terms, other than not involving the reinstatement of a clause protecting longstanding Commonwealth-origin residents in the UK, which was removed from the statute books by the Immigration Act 2014. The medical gatekeeping that saw Sylvester Marshall (previously referred to as Albert Thompson in the ) denied cancer treatment for six months might be here to stay – along with the ongoing planned deportation of Windrush generation migrants, and the continued detention of sexual assault and torture survivors.Perhaps the discovery of personal Commonwealth heritage is a relatively recent phenomenon for Javid. Or maybe, and stay with me here, the mere possession of melanin is not a cast-iron guarantee that a politician will err on the side of justice.But ultimately there’s only one person responsible for the Windrush affair, and the calamitous consequences of the hostile environment policy: Theresa May. Over the past eight years, hostile environment logic has been written through home office DNA.May’s tenure as home secretary was marked not only by her embrace of harsh rhetoric, but also structurally encoding an unforgiving, target-driven culture. A bonus of £5,000 to £10,000 was given to the head of immigration enforcement for delivering internal targets, including removals from the UK. Placed alongside May’s personal commitment to “deport first, hear appeals later”, this pay structure fundamentally undermines the integrity of our entire immigration system. How can anyone – whether a British citizen or a foreign national – have any faith that their case will be heard with respect for due process, when civil service oversight is corroded by the offer of a cash incentive?We have reached a point of mutually exclusive choosing in British immigration politics. We could continue with May as the guiding hand in home affairs, and make our peace with an unworkable, immoral and unjust policy immiserating the lives of migrants who have enriched this country. Or we could reject the Tory transformation of the Home Office into the Ministry of Institutional Racism – and commit to an immigration strategy that widens avenues towards citizenship recognises the immense contributions of Commonwealth migrants to British society and focuses its energies on regularising the tax arrangements of financial elites, rather than excluding working class people of colour from the NHS.A better and fairer policy is possible a transformed Home Office working culture is imperative. And it must begin with the end of May.• Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb799afe5e97ea936f5efd21a3f244a69fda838c/0_33_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f269d7c6e064a050eaf813e919c16290","title":"how we made outnumbered claire skinner interview","story":"‘Once the kids were done filming, Hugh Dennis and I would do all the reaction shots to broom handles with wigs on’There are many reasons why no TV series before Outnumbered had tried to capture the chaos of life with small kids. Restrictions on working hours aside, children hate things like learning lines, standing still, having strangers fiddling with their hair and being shouted at by men in puffa jackets yelling: “Action!”. Kids on telly always behaved wrongly, too. They tended to be standing in one place and looking directly at the person who was talking to them – whereas in real life, the adult who’s talking to them is the least interesting thing around. While we wanted to create something that was funny, we also wanted it to feel real, so we took the eye contact out and got rid of all things kids don’t like. There was no makeup, we ran the set in an informal way and we tried not to keep them hanging around. Before each scene, we would just give them an outline: “Your dad’s going to come in, he’s going to moan at you, you’re going to tell him to leave you alone.” And the kids would do it in their own words, in a completely authentic way.Getting it commissioned didn’t happen overnight. In the end, we made a 10-minute sample and, when we showed it to people, they finally got it. We recycled a chunk of this, the mother and daughter nit-combing scene, in the first episode. If you look closely, you’ll see that both Claire and Ramona suddenly have completely different hair. Nobody ever noticed.Some people thought we just turned up with cameras and let the kids make it up, but we had a complete, polished script that we worked hard on – we just didn’t show it to them. The improvised scenes were always with no pressure, and written so that if they didn’t work, they could just come straight out. As the years went by, we used improvisation less with the kids. As you grow older, you still have your imagination but you don’t have that same unselfconscious access to it. My own kids were mostly grown up but it didn’t matter. Parenting is fairly universal: my experiences turned out to be the same as Guy’s. And the dilemmas our fictional parents found themselves in were being played out in tens of thousands of homes up and down the country.When Andy and Guy approached me to play the mother, Sue, I was in the thick of parenting myself. My own kids were six and eight. I thought: “Yes, absolutely, I get this completely.”I liked the way both the mum and the dad, played by Hugh Dennis, were a bit slippery at times. There’s one episode that has Sue rifling through another child’s book-bag, trying to see what grades and feedback that kid has got to compare it to her own. Every parent wants to do that! We filmed in a house in Wandsworth, London, that belonged to a real family. Sometimes we’d arrive in the morning and find their kids still in bed. Our own three young stars would do their schoolwork in the house next door and we’d all eat our meals there too. When the team were ready to start filming the children, they would nip through a gap in the garden fence. Once the kids’ working hours were done, Hugh and I would do all the reverse shots to broom handles with wigs on, or Andy and Guy would stick gaffer tape across their chests and mark on a set of eyes where the kids’ eyelines would be. The kids were so young in the early series that they’re pretty much being themselves. Dan was perhaps furthest away from his character, Ben. He’s more thoughtful and very clever – although, like Ben, he was always trying to figure out how things worked. And then he’d break them. Will there be any more? Maybe a one-off or a Christmas special. It would be funny to see what the characters are all up to. It was such a great thing to be involved with and a very happy time. It was mad, scrappy, tiring and funny."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fffd94ad08db6a5b2474284a4d1336d2fc4793a7/0_114_3478_2086/master/3478.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24197263018701f044ce96906da96cd0","title":"how universities swept into hostile environment windrush","story":"The same policies that mistreated the Windrush generation turned universities into state ‘enforcers’The scandal about the mistreatment of the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation brought back to me an incident a couple of years ago that had vaguely troubled me at the time but I had put to the back of my mind.I had been asked to be the external examiner for a PhD by a university I had better not name. The supervisor was a former colleague and friend. The thesis was excellent and on an important topic. It all seemed very straightforward.But then I got a request from the HR department to send a photocopy of my passport, something I had never been asked for before. I was uneasy but complied. A few weeks later I met the vice-chancellor and casually mentioned what I had dismissed as typically over-fussy behaviour by HR.I was taken aback when instead of agreeing or sympathising, she robustly defended the request, saying the university was legally obliged to check anyone it paid was not in the UK illegally. I pointed out that it was difficult to imagine illegal immigrants making a living from the token fees paid to external examiners, and dropped the subject.The revelations about the damage inflicted by the government on people of the Windrush generation have been shocking. But there is another sinister symptom of the “hostile environment” that has far-reaching consequences and has yet to be remedied. The only thing the government has apologised for, under the duress of bad publicity, is that the wrong people – UK citizens or those with permanent residence rights – had been caught up in the net of its relentlessly hostile policy to immigrants. This same policy has turned hospitals, local councils, housing associations, employers, and, of course, colleges and universities, into state enforcers.Now universities are expected to check that anyone they make a payment to, however trivial, has a legal right to be in the UK. This covers not only external examiners but also speakers who receive any kind of fee as well as employees, casual and permanent. This vetting of external speakers is a far greater affront to academic freedom than the stray examples of no-platforming that so appal ministers and the Office for Students.It doesn’t end there. For a long time, some students who have lived in the UK and been educated here have been categorised as international students, and so have to pay high fees, because of question marks about their status.Then there is the government’s anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent, which involves more vetting. External speakers now have to prove not only that they are not “illegals”, but occasionally give an indication of what they are going to say to make sure they are not promoting (ill-defined) extremism.This is not the place to get into a detailed argument about the rights and wrongs of Prevent, although it is worth noting that it would be unconstitutional in the US and that restricting free speech, however extreme, has to be fully justified in a liberal democracy and open society.The real issue is whether it is right to place legal-administrative responsibilities on universities that, in effect, make them state agents. As the Windrush scandal reminds us, organisations err on the side of caution. If in doubt, don’t. So the vettings and restrictions inexorably spread.Maybe we should ponder the fate of the Central European University in Budapest, its very existence endangered by the triumphantly re-elected Orbán government – on a platform with chilling reminders of the anti-immigration agenda pursued less aggressively but just as surely by the\u0026nbspUK government with its Brexit “mandate”.The economist Friedrich Hayek, certainly a favourite among ministers and their supporting cast of ideologues, wrote a book entitled The Road to Serfdom. Universities are advancing down that road, lulled by the supposed limits set by English pragmatism and sense of “fair play”. Under the pretence of protecting the “customer”, they are burdened with ever more state regulation and control, as well as being turned into agents of the state on immigration, anti-radicalisation and the rest.Two final thoughts. How reassured will EU citizens working in our colleges and universities be by the treatment of the Windrush generation? As for me, next time I am asked to send a copy of my passport I will politely decline. To agree would be a betrayal of my rights as a free-born citizen of a country for ever associated with liberty.Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies, UCL Institute of Education"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1fecf64cdc6216cd6527eeb53947af4208d65f0/372_22_2239_1343/master/2239.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f85adf51a3afe878a894a65b0733cb","title":"bernardo bertolucci kevin spacey ridley scott all the money in the world","story":"The veteran director claims Scott should not have cut Spacey from All the Money in the World – and says he now wants to work with the disgraced actorBernardo Bertolucci has said that Ridley Scott “should be ashamed” over the decision to cut Kevin Spacey from his drama All the Money in the World.Scott made the last-minute decision to remove Spacey from the completed film last autumn after the actor and former Old Vic artistic director was accused of sexual harassment and assault by a number of men. Spacey’s scenes were reshot at great expense, with Christopher Plummer replacing him in the role of billionaire J Paul Getty.Yet, speaking at the world premiere of the restored version of his 1972 drama Last Tango in Paris at the Bari international film festival, Bertolucci was critical of the decision, according to the Italian newspaper il Giornale (via Deadline).“When I learned that Ridley Scott had agreed to eliminate the scenes of All the Money in the World in which Kevin Spacey was playing, I sent a message to editor Peter Scalia to tell Scott that he should be ashamed,” the Italian director said. “And then I immediately wanted to make a film with Spacey.”Berolucci’s comments were greeted with “much applause” from the audience, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The director later went on to add that he supported the #MeToo movement, and praised it for “bringing awareness to violence against women around the world”.Spacey is currently under investigation by prosecutors in Los Angeles and London over the allegations against him, which were instigated in October by actor Anthony Rapp, who claims that Spacey made sexual advances against him when he was 14. Spacey apologised to Rapp for any “inappropriate drunken behaviour” but said that he did not remember the encounter. Further allegations against the actor followed, with the Old Vic revealing that 20 people had alleged inappropriate behaviour by Spacey while he was the theatre’s artistic director. Aside from his response to Rapp, Spacey has declined to comment on the other allegations made against him.Bertolucci was himself the subject of widespread criticism in 2016 after revealing that the infamous rape scene in Last Tango in Paris was shot without the consent of actor Maria Schneider. Bertolucci claimed that he did not inform Schneider of the scene, in which Marlon Brando’s character uses a stick of butter as lubricant to rape her character, as he “wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress”. The director later claimed that the controversy had been based on a “ridiculous misunderstanding”.

In part, because it implies that there’s a singular self to find, rather than a whole melted Quality Street tubful, but also because some are not horror films.Some films about the teenage experience – and stay with me, because I know this sounds bananas – some films about the teenage experience, about that period in your life when you are scrabbling downhill to find some kind of identity, when your body is shifting like time-lapse photography of deserts, when everyone is suddenly MAD, and sex exists … Some of these films are written as comedies! The idea. The idea that there could be a single thing to laugh about. This, in part, is why I love Carrie. Carrie (played by Sissy Spacek, whose almost translucent complexion and wide foetal stare gives the appearance of a just-hatched squab) commits two terrible crimes. The first is that she doesn’t conform the second is that she tries. That silly, silly fool. It’s this transgression that takes her up on to the stage at prom, only to be drenched in a bucket of blood. As coming-of-age ceremonies go, it’s only Carrie’s that I can accept might have been more humiliating than my 1994 batmitzvah.Watching the scene as a teenage girl there is something particularly chilling about seeing her onstage covered in blood, because this experience is something that haunts you. This fear of blood in the wrong place, usually spreading quietly on the back of pale jeans, shame, and of everybody seeing. Coming-of-age stories are often read as awakenings but, in Carrie, it’s recognised that this time in your life often feels like the opposite instead of excitement and potential, most of us feel a new sort of dread. The supernatural powers Carrie discovers with puberty are, for many girls, mirrored only in the way our new bodies mean that grown men will leer at us from cars it’s an unwanted power, and a dangerous one we can’t control.Which, I suppose, is the point of movies. While at home, the teenage fights with our mums went no further than a few screams here in Bates, a town where teenage life is so brittle and dry it goes up in flames, Carrie’s relationship with her raging mother Margaret ends on a fight to the death with knives. But the irony is it was Margaret who warned her against going to prom, who said everyone would laugh at her, even miss-seeing her pink gown as red, the colour it would eventually, horrifically become. The final twist in this coming-of-age story is not Carrie’s undead hand bursting out of the soil, but the idea that your mother is always right. Spoiler.

The Frenchman is contracted to 2019 with an option for a further year, and would therefore command a considerable fee. Juve are understood to have indicated they would be prepared to pay around £45m for his services.Chelsea, braced for Real Madrid to firm up their long-standing interest in Eden Hazard, would consider the 22-year-old a player of considerable potential, but also one with the quality already to feature anywhere across their front line. United’s instinct will be to retain the forward, who they secured from Monaco for an initial £36m in 2015, but, if Martial pushes for a move, they may not be averse to selling, even to a isional rival. The clubs negotiated Nemanja Matic’s move to Old Trafford last summer, and José Mourinho retains an interest in the Chelsea forward, Willian.Abramovich is still hopeful Hazard will sign a new contract but is eager to instigate other changes to the playing staff at Stamford Bridge this summer, when Antonio Conte is expected to depart. Despite the uncertainty over the identity of the Italian’s successor, the club’s recruitment department – still operating without a technical director – have already begun exploring the market for potential additions, though Chelsea would have to generate funds through sales.A failure to qualify for the Champions League – they are fifth, now five points behind Tottenham with three games to play – would result in a shortfall of up to £70m in revenues and, in order to satisfy Financial Fair Play rules, fringe players may be moved on. Borussia Dortmund may seek to make Michy Batshuayi’s loan move a permanent deal after the Belgian impressed in the Bundesliga with seven goals in nine starts prior to an ankle injury. Kurt Zouma and Kenedy, currently on loan at Stoke and Newcastle respectively, could also move on, while Tomas Kalas and Lucas Piazon could join Fulham permanently if Slavisa Jokanovic’s side are promoted to the top flight.The England internationals Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is expected to be in Gareth Southgate’s squad for the summer’s World Cup finals, and Tammy Abraham will not be sold, but the likes of Marco van Ginkel and even Danny Drinkwater, who has endured a frustrating first season at the club since arriving from Leicester for £35m, could also depart. David Luiz, under-used all season, may consider the changes in the dugout before confronting his own future at the club.Chelsea boast a net outlay of around £119m since 2014 with their business model having shifted markedly from the lavish spending of the early Abramovich era. The oligarch remains as committed as ever, with the club committed to redeveloping Stamford Bridge, but will continue to comply with FFP, meaning they will not boast the leeway enjoyed by Manchester City and United in the market.Abramovich is to be honoured by the Federation of Jewish communities of Russia, whose board of trustees he chairs, for investing in excess of £360m into Jewish communities in Russia, Israel and other countries around the world. “Much of the work we do has been made possible thanks to Mr Abramovich, and we are deeply thankful for his continued support,” said the FJCR president, Rabbi Alexander Boroda.“We have more than 160 communities in all of Russia and Roman supports them all. He never talks about it, but I want to because people don’t understand who is the source of it is – and it is him.” Chelsea have run a prominent ‘Say No to Antisemitism’ campaign, personally initiated by the owner, since February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0452ebb2efa217f95475af6d8312dea1a64087e3/129_1128_923_554/master/923.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX2RlZmF1bHQucG5n\u0026amp;s=e3fb97ff4f6d7337ef512201ccd871a4","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3549b3318c46b99df64bf3b39da88226793a71/0_115_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848dd5a33abde27e787afa6fddbd99e4","title":"from glossies to gal dem the websites revolutionising womens media","story":"Frustrated about the narrow, stereotyped world of magazines supposedly aimed at them, a group of female journalists have moved online to tackle politics, social justice and identityOver the past decade, the women’s magazine has undergone a radical makeover.

Here, the women behind London-based site gal-dem and Mille World, an online magazine aimed at Arab readers, explain why they are determined to reimagine the women’s magazine as a force for positive change. RASofia Guellaty launched Mille World out of frustration that it did not already exist. She was looking for a publication that engaged with what it meant to be a young Arab woman. Versace, Dior, Calvin Klein and Chanel were sending hijabs down their runways, but who was catering to the savvy, cosmopolitan Arab women looking to reclaim the Arab narrative for an educated Arab audience? It turned out no one was, so Guellaty decided to.Educated in Paris, but born and now based in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, 35-year-old Guellaty was at the helm of Condé Nast’s first Middle East launch, the now-closed StyleArabia, two years ago. “I kept hearing about things being ‘good enough’ for the Arab market. That really got to me, this ‘good enough’ attitude. Two things: one, it’s not good enough, what you’re doing is crap. Two, it’s racist,” Guellaty says. Two years ago, she quit Condé Nast last May she became pregnant with her first child. It was during her pregnancy that she developed the idea for Mille World. After giving birth, she recruited the first members of the board, which now includes Saudi princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud and Saif Mahdhi, the president of Next Models. She recruited the company’s CEO, Nez Gebreel, from the Dubai Design and Fashion Council. It was crucial to Guellaty that her executive and editorial team were Arabs and leaders in their field.Mille World launched in January and already has 40,000 unique visitors a month. Its readers come from across the Arab world and diaspora, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Lebanon, Egypt, France, the UK and the US. Its 12-person editorial staff is equally international, based in Dubai, London, Paris and Tunis. The deputy editor, Samira Larouci, 28, has lived in Dalston, London, for years, but she was raised in “very, very white” Chichester by her Moroccan parents. She left i-D magazine in July, having helped set up its luxury lifestyle site, Amuse. She was put in touch with Guellaty by a mutual friend. Their first phone call lasted two and a half hours. “We were talking about Arab identity issues I’ve always been seeking a community of my own to connect with. We both agreed there was a voice missing that we wanted to hear. It was young, inclusive and not based around materialism,” Larouci says. “We wanted to address that need. It’s almost laughable no one’s done it before.”Larouci now commissions and edits the bulk of the site’s editorial content – 60 pieces a month, every one of which is translated into English, French and Arabic. She is interested particularly in Arab counterculture and championing Arab artists who do not have any other platform in their region. “The reader I want to reach is someone studying in Washington, raised in Saudi, who’s in a sort of cultural limbo. That’s where I come from. I want to find those people in LA who are interested in feminism in the Arab world,” Larouci says.Deep in the belly of a south London car park lie the offices of gal-dem, an online magazine produced exclusively by women and non-binary people of colour. It is not big – each of the work studios in Peckham Levels has been converted from a single parking space – but it is significant. By parsing culture and current affairs through a prism of intersectional feminism, covering topics from Grenfell to mooncups, gal-dem is one of the publications changing the face of female-focused media.As a concept, gal-dem is a world away from the blinkered women’s glossies available to the editorial team in their youth. While those magazines shared some women’s stories, the scope was narrow, and much of the content was designed to reaffirm strict beauty standards. gal-dem, meanwhile, has no such agenda, aiming to provide women with just one thing: a voice. In this sense, the site is part of a much broader cultural shift in women’s media – one that has seen print titles fail (recent casualties include Company, She, Glamour, Bliss and Sugar) and a new breed of online magazine take their place. Riding the fourth wave of feminism, publications such as The Pool and Refinery 29 are fuelled not by materialism, but by a rich seam of untapped subject matter: the experiences women have long been told to keep quiet.While the gal-dem team acknowledge their position in the wider landscape of newly feminist media, they are careful to distinguish themselves from their peers. “There is a tendency within feminism for its face to be quite white and middle-class,” says Little. “To see an editorial team comprising women of colour is a rarity I think that is clearly our point of difference.” From her desk in the gal-dem offices, the deputy editor – and  contributor – Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff explains how the focus on issues that affect women of colour manifests itself in gal-dem’s attitude. “The tone in general is a bit more serious than the Refinerys and Bustles we don’t have that ‘you’re talking to your best friend’ thing going on,” she says. “The nature of the topics we’re talking about a lot of the time don’t really lend themselves to that and we don’t want to ever dilute that seriousness.”Slowly, gal-dem’s efforts to rectify a lack of representation are being echoed by the mainstream media – with decidedly mixed results. Since he took over six months ago, the Vogue editor Edward Enninful has managed to include five women of colour on his covers (February’s Vogue featured Little in a spread about “the new suffragettes”), yet glossies are still regularly derided for their treatment of black women. In November, the actor Lupita Nyong’o expressed her disappointment at Grazia’s decision to photoshop away her natural hair on its cover the previous month, the Evening Standard’s magazine caused much consternation by airbrushing Solange’s braids. And just because online magazines tend to avoid scandal, that does not mean they are necessarily much better, Brinkhurst-Cuff says. “It would be more hidden if there was an issue online, because you don’t have the physical print cover to see. We can say Alexandra Shulman only published 12 black women on the cover, whereas if an online publication is pretty much exclusively publishing white writers or using stock images of white women you’re arguably less likely to pick up on that.” That said, she sees the new online media “struggling towards intersectionality, for the right or wrong reasons. Diversity is in fashion right now, but we hope it’s not always about money.”Money, however, is something gal-dem is beginning to consider seriously. Until now, it has been a voluntary organisation. Nobody gets paid, apart from contributors on specific brand collaborations the annual print issue, the covers of which hang from the office’s chipboard walls, is more passion project than money-maker. But as the site has grown – gal-dem receives “anything from 4,000 to 20,000 unique visitors a day”, according to Little – the team believe it is turning into an economically viable enterprise. Little has just stopped working full-time and the team are developing a business plan.It is still early days for the new breed of women’s magazine and the economic forecast remains uncertain – but, in terms of broadening the scope for women’s media, the legacy of gal-dem and its peers already seems indelible.

Here’s why that’s not very clever. By  David RuncimanDemocracy is tired, vindictive, self-deceiving, paranoid, clumsy and frequently ineffectual. Much of the time it is living on past glories. This sorry state of affairs reflects what we have become. But current democracy is not who we are. It is just a system of government, which we built, and which we could replace. So why don’t we replace it with something better?This line of argument has grown louder in recent years, as democratic politics has become more unpredictable and, to many, deeply alarming in its outcomes. First Brexit, then Donald Trump, plus the rise of populism and the spread of ision, has started a tentative search for plausible alternatives. But the rival systems we see around us have a very limited appeal. The unlovely forms of 21st-century authoritarianism can at best provide only a partial, pragmatic alternative to democracy. The world’s strongmen still pander to public opinion, and in the case of competitive authoritarian regimes such as the ones in Hungary and Turkey, they persist with the rigmarole of elections. From Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is not much of a leap into a brighter future.There is a far more dogmatic alternative, which has its roots in the 19th century. Why not ditch the charade of voting altogether? Stop pretending to respect the views of ordinary people – it’s not worth it, since the people keep getting it wrong. Respect the experts instead! This is the truly radical option. So should we try it?The name for this view of politics is epistocracy: the rule of the knowers. It is directly opposed to democracy, because it argues that the right to participate in political decision-making depends on whether or not you know what you are doing. The basic premise of democracy has always been that it doesn’t matter how much you know: you get a say because you have to live with the consequences of what you do. In ancient Athens, this principle was reflected in the practice of choosing office-holders by lottery. Anyone could do it because everyone – well, everyone who wasn’t a woman, a foreigner, a pauper, a slave or a child – counted as a member of the state. With the exception of jury service in some countries, we don’t choose people at random for important roles any more. But we do uphold the underlying idea by letting citizens vote without checking their suitability for the task.Critics of democracy – starting with Plato – have always argued that it means rule by the ignorant, or worse, rule by the charlatans that the ignorant people fall for. Living in Cambridge, a passionately pro-European town and home to an elite university, I heard echoes of that argument in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. It was usually uttered sotto voce – you have to be a brave person to come out as an epistocrat in a democratic society – but it was unquestionably there. Behind their hands, very intelligent people muttered to each other that this is what you get if you ask a question that ordinary people don’t understand. Dominic Cummings, the author of the “Take Back Control” slogan that helped win the referendum, found that his critics were not so shy about spelling it out to his face. Brexit happened, they told him, because the wicked people lied to the stupid people. So much for democracy.To say that democrats want to be ruled by the stupid and the ignorant is unfair. No defender of democracy has ever claimed that stupidity or ignorance are virtues in themselves. But it is true that democracy doesn’t discriminate on the grounds of a lack of knowledge. It considers the ability to think intelligently about difficult questions a secondary consideration. The primary consideration is whether an inidual is implicated in the outcome. Democracy asks only that the voters should be around long enough to suffer for their own mistakes.The question that epistocracy poses is: why don’t we discriminate on the basis of knowledge? What’s so special about letting everyone take part? Behind it lies the intuitively appealing thought that, instead of living with our mistakes, we should do everything in our power to prevent them in the first place – then it wouldn’t matter who has to take responsibility.This argument has been around for more than 2,000 years. For most of that time, it has been taken very seriously. The consensus until the end of the 19th century was that democracy is usually a bad idea: it is just too risky to put power in the hands of people who don’t know what they are doing. Of course, that was only the consensus among intellectuals. We have little way of knowing what ordinary people thought about the question. Nobody was asking them.Over the course of the 20th century, the intellectual consensus was turned around. Democracy established itself as the default condition of politics, its virtues far outweighing its weaknesses. Now the events of the 21st century have revived some of the original doubts. Democracies do seem to be doing some fairly stupid things at present. Perhaps no one will be able to live with their mistakes. In the age of Trump, climate change and nuclear weapons, epistocracy has teeth again.So why don’t we give more weight to the views of the people who are best qualified to evaluate what to do? Before answering that question, it is important to distinguish between epistocracy and something with which it is often confused: technocracy. They are different. Epistocracy means rule by the people who know best. Technocracy is rule by mechanics and engineers. A technocrat is someone who understands how the machinery works.In November 2011, Greek democracy was suspended and an elected government was replaced by a cabinet of experts, tasked with stabilising the collapsing Greek economy before new elections could be held. This was an experiment in technocracy, however, not epistocracy. The engineers in this case were economists. Even highly qualified economists often haven’t a clue what’s best to do. What they know is how to operate a complex system that they have been instrumental in building – so long as it behaves the way it is meant to. Technocrats are the people who understand what’s best for the machine. But keeping the machine running might be the worst thing we could do. Technocrats won’t help with that question.Both representative democracy and pragmatic authoritarianism have plenty of space for technocracy. Increasingly, each system has put decision-making capacity in the hands of specially trained experts, particularly when it comes to economic questions. Central bankers wield significant power in a wide variety of political systems around the world. For that reason, technocracy is not really an alternative to democracy. Like populism, it is more of an add-on. What makes epistocracy different is that it prioritises the “right” decision over the technically correct decision. It tries to work out where we should be going. A technocrat can only tell us how we should get there.How would epistocracy function in practice? The obvious difficulty is knowing who should count as the knowers. There is no formal qualification for being a general expert. It is much easier to identify a suitable technocrat. Technocracy is more like plumbing than philosophy. When Greece went looking for economic experts to sort out its financial mess, it headed to Goldman Sachs and the other big banks, since that is where the technicians were congregated. When a machine goes wrong, the people responsible for fixing it often have their fingerprints all over it already.Historically, some epistocrats have tackled the problem of identifying who knows best by advocating non-technical qualifications for politics. If there were such a thing as the university of life, that’s where these epistocrats would want political decision-makers to get their higher degrees. But since there is no such university, they often have to make do with cruder tests of competence. The 19th-century philosopher John Stuart Mill argued for a voting system that granted varying numbers of votes to different classes of people depending on what jobs they did. Professionals and other highly educated iniduals would get six or more votes each farmers and traders would get three or four skilled labourers would get two unskilled labourers would get one. Mill also pushed hard for women to get the vote, at a time when that was a deeply unfashionable view. He did not do this because he thought women were the equals of men. It was because he thought some women, especially the better educated, were superior to most men. Mill was a big fan of discrimination, so long as it was on the right grounds.To 21st-century eyes, Mill’s system looks grossly undemocratic. Why should a lawyer get more votes than a labourer? Mill’s answer would be to turn the question on its head: why should a labourer get the same number of votes as a lawyer? Mill was no simple democrat, but he was no technocrat either. Lawyers didn’t qualify for their extra votes because politics placed a special premium on legal expertise. No, lawyers got their extra votes because what’s needed are people who have shown an aptitude for thinking about questions with no easy answers. Mill was trying to stack the system to ensure as many different points of view as possible were represented. A government made up exclusively of economists or legal experts would have horrified him. The labourer still gets a vote. Skilled labourers get two. But even though a task like bricklaying is a skill, it is a narrow one. What was needed was breadth. Mill believed that some points of view carried more weight simply because they had been exposed to more complexity along the way.Jason Brennan, a very 21st-century philosopher, has tried to revive the epistocratic conception of politics, drawing on thinkers like Mill. In his 2016 book Against Democracy, Brennan insists that many political questions are simply too complex for most voters to comprehend. Worse, the voters are ignorant about how little they know: they lack the ability to judge complexity because they are so attached to simplistic solutions that feel right to them.Brennan writes: “Suppose the United States had a referendum on whether to allow significantly more immigrants into the country. Knowing whether this is a good idea requires tremendous social scientific knowledge. One needs to know how immigration tends to affect crime rates, domestic wages, immigrants’ welfare, economic growth, tax revenues, welfare expenditures and the like. Most Americans lack this knowledge in fact, our evidence is that they are systematically mistaken.”In other words, it’s not just that they don’t know it’s not even that they don’t know that they don’t know it’s that they are wrong in ways that reflect their unwavering belief that they are right.Brennan doesn’t have Mill’s faith that we can tell how well-equipped someone is to tackle a complex question by how difficult that person’s job is. There is too much chance and social conditioning involved. He would prefer an actual exam, to “screen out citizens who are badly misinformed or ignorant about the election, or who lack basic social scientific knowledge”. Of course, this just pushes the fundamental problem back a stage without resolving it: who gets to set the exam? Brennan teaches at a university, so he has little faith in the disinterested qualities of most social scientists, who have their own ideologies and incentives. He has also seen students cramming for exams, which can produce its own biases and blind spots. Still, he thinks Mill was right to suggest that the further one advances up the educational ladder, the more votes one should get: five extra votes for finishing high school, another five for a bachelor’s degree, and five more for a graduate degree.Brennan is under no illusions about how provocative this case is today, 150 years after Mill made it. In the middle of the 19th century, the idea that political status should track social and educational standing was barely contentious today, it is barely credible. Brennan also has to face the fact that contemporary social science provides plenty of evidence that the educated are just as subject to groupthink as other people, sometimes even more so. The political scientists Larry Bartels and Christopher Achen point this out in their 2016 book Democracy for Realists: “The historical record leaves little doubt that the educated, including the highly educated, have gone wrong in their moral and political thinking as often as everyone else.” Cognitive biases are no respecters of academic qualifications. How many social science graduates would judge the question about immigration according to the demanding tests that Brennan lays out, rather than according to what they would prefer to believe? The irony is that if Brennan’s voter exam were to ask whether the better-educated deserve more votes, the technically correct answer might be no. It would depend on who was marking it.However, in one respect Brennan insists that the case for epistocracy has grown far stronger since Mill made it. That is because Mill was writing at the dawn of democracy. Mill published his arguments in the run-up to what became the Second Reform Act of 1867, which doubled the size of the franchise in Britain to nearly 2.5 million voters (out of a general population of 30 million). Mill’s case for epistocracy was based on his conviction that over time it would merge into democracy. The labourer who gets one vote today would get more tomorrow, once he had learned how to use his vote wisely. Mill was a great believer in the educative power of democratic participation.Brennan thinks we now have 100-plus years of evidence that Mill was wrong. Voting is bad for us. It doesn’t make people better informed. If anything, it makes them stupider, because it dignifies their prejudices and ignorance in the name of democracy. “Political participation is not valuable for most people,” Brennan writes. “On the contrary, it does most of us little good and instead tends to stultify and corrupt us. It turns us into civic enemies who have grounds to hate one another.” The trouble with democracy is that it gives us no reason to become better informed. It tells us we are fine as we are. And we’re not.In the end, Brennan’s argument is more historical than philosophical. If we were unaware of how democracy would turn out, it might make sense to cross our fingers and assume the best of it. But he insists that we do know, and so we have no excuse to keep kidding ourselves. Brennan thinks that we should regard epistocrats like himself as being in the same position as democrats were in the mid-19th century. What he is championing is anathema to many people, as democracy was back then. Still, we took a chance on democracy, waiting to see how it would turn out. Why shouldn’t we take a chance on epistocracy, now we know how the other experiment went? Why do we assume that democracy is the only experiment we are ever allowed to run, even after it has run out of steam?It’s a serious question, and it gets to how the longevity of democracy has stifled our ability to think about the possibility of something different. What was once a seemingly reckless form of politics has become a byword for caution. And yet there are still good reasons to be cautious about ditching it. Epistocracy remains the reckless idea. There are two dangers in particular.The first is that we set the bar too high in politics by insisting on looking for the best thing to do. Sometimes it is more important to avoid the worst. Even if democracy is often bad at coming up with the right answers, it is good at unpicking the wrong ones. Moreover, it is good at exposing people who think they always know best. Democratic politics assumes there is no settled answer to any question and it ensures that is the case by allowing everyone a vote, including the ignorant. The randomness of democracy – which remains its essential quality – protects us against getting stuck with truly bad ideas. It means that nothing will last for long, because something else will come along to disrupt it.Epistocracy is flawed because of the second part of the word rather than the first – this is about power (kratos) as much as it is about knowledge (episteme). Fixing power to knowledge risks creating a monster that can’t be deflected from its course, even when it goes wrong – which it will, since no one and nothing is infallible. Not knowing the right answer is a great defence against people who believe that their knowledge makes them superior.Brennan’s response to this argument (a version of which is made by David Estlund in his 2007 book Democratic Authority) is to turn it on its head. Since democracy is a form of kratos, too, he says, why aren’t we concerned about protecting iniduals from the incompetence of the demos just as much as from the arrogance of the epistocrats? But these are not the same kinds of power. Ignorance and foolishness don’t oppress in the same way that knowledge and wisdom do, precisely because they are incompetent: the demos keeps changing its mind.The democratic case against epistocracy is a version of the democratic case against pragmatic authoritarianism. You have to ask yourself where you’d rather be when things go wrong. Maybe things will go wrong quicker and more often in a democracy, but that is a different issue. Rather than thinking of democracy as the least worst form of politics, we could think of it as the best when at its worst. It is the difference between Winston Churchill’s famous dictum and a similar one from Alexis de Tocqueville a hundred years earlier that is less well-known but more apposite. More fires get started in a democracy, de Tocqueville said, but more fires get put out, too.The recklessness of epistocracy is also a function of the historical record that Brennan uses to defend it. A century or more of democracy may have uncovered its failings, but they have also taught us that we can live with them. We are used to the mess and attached to the benefits. Being an epistocrat like Mill before democracy had got going is very different from being one now that democracy is well established. We now know what we know, not just about democracy’s failings, but about our tolerance for its incompetences.The great German sociologist Max Weber, writing at the turn of the 20th century, took it for granted that universal suffrage was a dangerous idea, because of the way that it empowered the mindless masses. But he argued that once it had been granted, no sane politician should ever think about taking it away: the backlash would be too terrible. The only thing worse than letting everyone vote is telling some people that they no longer qualify. Never mind who sets the exam, who is going to tell us that we’ve failed? Mill was right: democracy comes after epistocracy, not before. You can’t run the experiment in reverse.The cognitive biases that epistocracy is meant to rescue us from are what will ultimately scupper it. Loss aversion makes it more painful to be deprived of something we have that doesn’t always work than something we don’t have that might. It’s like the old joke. Q: “Do you know the way to Dublin?” A: “Well, I wouldn’t start from here.” How do we get to a better politics? Well, maybe we shouldn’t start from here. But here is where we are.Still, there must be other ways of trying to inject more wisdom into democratic politics than an exam. This is the 21st century: we have new tools to work with. If many of the problems with democracy derive from the business of politicians hawking for votes at election time, which feeds noise and bile into the decision-making process, perhaps we should try to simulate what people would choose under more sedate and reflective conditions. For instance, it may be possible to extrapolate from what is known about voters’ interests and preferences what they ought to want if they were better able to access the knowledge they needed. We could run mock elections that replicate the input from different points of view, as happens in real elections, but which strip out all the distractions and distortions of democracy in action.Brennan suggests the following: “We can administer surveys that track citizens’ political preferences and demographic characteristics, while testing their basic objective political knowledge. Once we have this information, we can simulate what would happen if the electorate’s demographics remained unchanged, but all citizens were able to get perfect scores on tests of objective political knowledge. We can determine, with a strong degree of confidence, what ‘We the People’ would want, if only ‘We the People’ understood what we were talking about.”Democratic dignity – the idea that all citizens should be allowed to express their views and have them taken seriously by politicians – goes out the window under such a system. We are each reduced to data points in a machine-learning exercise. But, according to Brennan, the outcomes should improve.In 2017, a US-based digital technology company called Kimera Systems announced that it was close to developing an AI named Nigel, whose job was to help voters know how they should vote in an election, based on what it already knew of their personal preferences. Its creator, Mounir Shita, declared: “Nigel tries to figure out your goals and what reality looks like to you and is constantly assimilating paths to the future to reach your goals. It’s constantly trying to push you in the right direction.”This is the more personalised version of what Brennan\u0026nbspis proposing, with some of the democratic dignity plugged back in. Nigel is not trying to work out what’s best for everyone, only what’s best for you. It accepts your version of reality. Yet Nigel understands that you are incapable of drawing the correct political inferences from your preferences. You need help, from a\u0026nbspmachine that has seen enough of your personal behaviour to understand what it is you are after. Siri recommends books you might like. Nigel recommends political parties and policy positions.Would this be so bad? To many people it instinctively sounds like a parody of democracy because it treats us like confused children. But to Shita it is an enhancement of democracy because it takes our desires seriously. Democratic politicians don’t much care what it is that\u0026nbspwe actually want. They care what it is they can persuade us we want, so they can better appeal to it. Nigel puts the voter first. At the same time, by protecting us from our own confusion and inattention, Nigel strives to improve our self-understanding. Brennan’s version effectively gives up on Mill’s original\u0026nbspidea that voting might be an educative experience. Shita hasn’t given up. Nigel is trying to nudge us along the path to self-knowledge. We\u0026nbspmight end up learning who we really are.The fatal flaw with this approach, however, is that we risk learning only who it is we think we are, or who it is we would like to be. Worse, it is who we would like to be now, not who or what we might become in the future. Like focus groups, Nigel provides a snapshot of a set of\u0026nbspattitudes at a moment in time. The danger of any system\u0026nbspof machine learning is that it produces feedback\u0026nbsploops. By restricting the dataset to our past behaviour, Nigel teaches us nothing about what other people think, or even about other ways of seeing the world. Nigel simply mines the archive of our attitudes for the most consistent expression of our identities. If we lean left, we will end up leaning further left. If we lean right, we will end up leaning further right. Social and political ision would widen. Nigel is designed to\u0026nbspclose the circle in our minds.There are technical fixes for feedback loops. Systems can be adjusted to inject alternative points of view, to notice when data is becoming self-reinforcing or simply to randomise the evidence. We can shake things up to lessen the risk that we get set in our ways. For instance, Nigel could make sure that we visit websites that challenge rather than reinforce our preferences. Alternatively, on Brennan’s model, the aggregation of\u0026nbspour preferences could seek to take account of the likelihood that Nigel had exaggerated rather than tempered who we really are. A Nigel of Nigels – a machine that helps other machines to better align their\u0026nbspown goals – could try to strip out the distortions from the artificial democracy we have built. After all, Nigel is our servant, not our master. We can always tell him what to do.But that is the other fundamental problem with 21st-century epistocracy: we won’t be the ones telling Nigel what to do. It will be the technicians who have built the system. They are the experts we rely on to rescue us from feedback loops. For this reason, it is hard\u0026nbspto see how 21st-century epistocracy can avoid collapsing back into technocracy. When things go wrong, the knowers will be powerless to correct for them. Only the engineers who built the machines have\u0026nbspthat capacity, which means that it will be the engineers who have the power.In recent weeks, we have been given a glimpse of\u0026nbspwhat rule by engineers might look like. It is not an authoritarian nightmare of oppression and violence. It is a picture of confusion and obfuscation. The power of engineers never fully comes out into the open, because most people don’t understand what it is they do. The sight of Mark Zuckerberg, perched on his cushion, batting off the ignorant questions of the people’s representatives in Congress is a glimpse of a technocratic future in which democracy meets its\u0026nbspmatch. But this is not a radical alternative to democratic politics. It is simply a distortion of it.Adapted from How Democracy Ends by David Runciman, which will be published by Profile on 10 May.

The cross-party amendment, supported by 19 Conservative rebels, succeeded with a majority of 91. Fox said on Tuesday: “I think there’s a very big debate now about whether the unelected house can actually thwart the view of the British electorate in a referendum and … legislation coming from the House of Commons.”He conceded the parliamentary arithmetic was difficult in a hung parliament. “We don’t have a parliamentary majority and that makes life harder, but there are of course quite a number of Labour MPs who represent seats where there is a very heavy vote in favour of leaving … who I think are rash, to say the least, if they try to confront the democratic view of the British people,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The slew of Lords defeats, and the difficulties they will pose in the Commons, will cast a shadow over a crucial meeting of the Brexit cabinet sub-committee this week, where senior ministers are split over the customs union.Key Brexiters want to drop one of the two options put forward by the government. Fox and Boris Johnson have called on May to abandon her preferred option of a “customs partnership”, which relies on Britain collecting EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.The option would bring the UK closer to solving issues over the Northern Irish border but Brexiter critics have said it would be a customs union in all but name. Fox said on Tuesday: “I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable. If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.”Fox refused to deny he would resign if a customs partnership was agreed, and did not challenge the assertion by the Today presenter John Humphrys that May was a “horribly weakened prime minister”, replying that a hung parliament had made agreeing its Brexit legislation harder.Overnight, peers also voted for an amendment that would require parliamentary approval for the Brexit negotiating mandate in phase two of the talks – similar to the process where EU27 leaders approve the mandate of their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The third defeat was led by the Labour peer Alf Dubs, who won backing for his amendment which would ensure child asylum seekers would be allowed to join family members in the UK after Brexit.A Liberal Democrat attempt to amend the bill to give voters a referendum on the final deal did not pass, although one Labour frontbench peer, Philip Hunt, ignored party orders to abstain and voted in favour. Labour sources said he would be hauled before Labour’s leader in the Lords and chief whip, but the Conservatives called for him to be sacked.The Brexit minister Steve Baker said: “If Labour want to be taken seriously as a party which respects the decision the people took in the referendum, they must remove Lord Hunt from their frontbench.“All their behaviour to this date has shown a determination to disrupt a successful Brexit, but failure to act now would demonstrate a contempt for those who voted for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f367416784ec2866b4df188a8a7d2f42cf58785f/0_150_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fd2bd3469f9e8051540c5de4278612","title":"brexit david davis lords liam fox tells may that compromising over customs union would be unacceptable politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including David Davis giving evidence to the Lords EU committee on BrexitWe’ve got some new ICM polling out today. Here are the key figures.Finally, we asked about President Trump’s visit to the UK in July. It turns out it is not as unpopular as some of us might have expected.I will post a link to the ICM tables here, when they go up on the ICM website.ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,026 adults aged 18+, between 27 and 29 April 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.Sinn Fein accused Northern Ireland’s two unionist MEPs of “bad manners” today because they were not in Derry to meet Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. Northern Ireland’s third MEP, Sinn Fein’s Martina Anderson, was there, and she claimed that the DUP MEP Diane Dodds and Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson were failing to represent the unionist community by “snubbing” Barnier. She said:I think it’s unfortunate that they haven’t turned up. The parliament is not open today.The European parliament is closed, so there’s no reason why both of the MEPs from the unionist population shouldn’t be here.All three of us should be maximising the opportunity when Michel Barnier is in our constituency. I think it’s political bad manners that the MEPs - and I have to say the two council leads from the DUP and UUP - were both invited here this morning, and neither of them have turned up.I don’t think really when you have a chief negotiator coming from the EU that it’s a good signal to send out because I don’t think it’s representative of the people, the protestant, unionist, loyalist people, who would want their own representatives taking the opportunity to express their views.Last week Dodds and Nicholson issued a joint statement welcoming Barnier’s visit but expressed disappointment that it was announced by a Sinn Fein MP. George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard, has just tweeted this picture of his paper’s splash today. The story does not seem to be online yet, but I will post a link when I find one.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has been in Derry in Northern Ireland this morning. He was asked about last night’s Lords vote, but declined to comment on the grounds that he did not want to get involved in UK domestic politics.As Sky’s Darren McCaffrey points out, Barnier also suggested that EU “peace funding” for Northern Ireland would continue after Brexit.The People’s Vote campaign, which is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, has put out this statement from the Labour MP Wes Streeting about Liam Fox’s Today interview. Streeting said:Liam Fox’s fundamental problem appears to be that he is frightened of democracy and parliamentary sovereignty.On the Today Programme this morning he completely mispresented the decision of the House of Lords to amend the EU withdrawal bill yesterday.The amendment the Lords passed gives power to the House of Commons – and the Commons alone – to hold ministers to account on any withdrawal agreement. It doesn’t give the Lords any matching power.So why is Liam Fox so afraid of a more powerful House of Commons? Is it for the same reason that he repeatedly refused to admit that parliament also has the power to give the decision about the final Brexit deal to the people?Brexit is a big deal, but it is not a done deal and Liam Fox needs to understand why more and more people are demanding a people’s vote on the final Brexit deal: they believe, and they are right to believe, that this decision is too big to be left to comfortable and complacent politicians like Liam Fox and has to be in the hands of the people as a whole.Streeting’s claim that “more and more people are demanding a people’s vote” is questionable. The polling expert John Curtice looked at this in a blog post for his What UK Thinks website recently and concluded that there was “no sign ... of any recent change in the balance of opinion on holding a second referendum”. But opposition to a second referendum is lower this year than it was last year, he admitted.As Curtice explained in a different blog, the results vary hugely depending on how the question is framed.Yesterday, after the first and most important of the three government defeats on the EU withdrawal bill in the Lords, the government said the amendment passed would “weaken the UK’s hand in our negotiations with the EU”. It will mean that, if parliament votes down the withdrawal agreement in the autumn, the government will have to obey any motions passed by parliament ordering it to reopen Brexit talks instead of the UK simply leaving with no deal at all. On the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the international development secretary, strongly attack the vote.But the government has not said yet it will definitely try to overturn the vote when the bill returns to the Lords. And that is because at this stage it is by no means certain that it would have the vote to win.In December the government lost a vote on the EU withdrawal bill in the Commons when 12 Tories rebelled. This morning at least three of those 12 have taken to Twitter to express their opposition to what Fox was saying in his interview. Here they are.Here is Sajid Javid, the new home secretary, arriving for cabinet this morning.(This morning he seems to have eschewed the “Tory power stance”.)As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, in his Today interview Liam Fox also accused the House of Lords of trying to block Brexit.Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, says Fox is just being silly.Brexit is back as the dominant story at Westminster. After the government suffered its most significant Lords defeat on the EU withdrawal bill last night, David Davis, the Brexit secretary, will have his chance to respond when he gives evidence to a Lords committee this afternoon. But, before that, we’ve had Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who got the lead 8.10am slot on the Today programme.Brexiters are increasingly worried about the prospect of Theresa May coming forward with some sort of compromise on the customs union. Number 10 has repeatedly said the UK will leave the customs union, but in leave circles they are worried that, it it becomes clear that the government’s alternative customs proposals would be unworkable or too cumbersome, May could end up adopting a plan that would keep the UK in the customs union in all but name.In his Today interview Fox, a leading Brexiter, insisted this would be unacceptable. He told the programme: I don’t think we can stay in the customs union for a number of reasons, the main reason being that we would be in a worse position than we are today.If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice. That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union.I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable.If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.Asked if he would resign if the government ended up staying in the customs union, Fox said he would not answer a hypothetical question - but in such as way as to make it perfectly obvious that the answer was “yes”.He also notably refused to challenge John Humphrys when he asked a question about May being a “horribly weakened prime minister”, at a time when the country needed a tough, strong one. Fox just said the Conservatives did not have a majority in parliament, which made life harder.Here is some comment on his interview.From the Sun’s Harry ColeFrom the ’s Kate McCannHere is the agenda for the day.10am: Sir Mark Sedwill, the national security adviser, gives evidence to the Commons defence committee.After 12.45pm: MPs resume their debate on the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill.

Compared with people who adopted none of them, men and women who adhered to all five saw their life expectancy at 50 rise from 26 to 38 years and 29 to 43 years respectively, or an extra 12 years for men and 14 for women.“When we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer. But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was,” said Meir Stampfer, a co-author on the study and professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.The researchers performed the analysis in the hope of understanding why the US, which spends more on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than any other nation, ranks 31st in the world for life expectancy at birth. According to the World Health Organization, life expectancy at birth in 2015 was 76.9 and 81.6 years old for US men and women respectively. The equivalent figures for Britain are very similar at 79.4 and 83 years old.The five healthy habits were defined as not smoking having a body mass index between 18.5 and 25 taking at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, having no more than one 150ml glass of wine a day for women, or two for men and having a diet rich in items such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains and low in red meat, saturated fats and sugar.Given that the habits of a healthy lifestyle are well known, the mystery is why we are so bad at adopting them, said Stampfer. Part of the problem is that many people struggle to give up smoking, and the continuous peddling of unhealthy food, as well as poor urban planning, which can make it hard for people to exercise, also feed in, he said.“I do think people need to step up and take some personal responsibility, but as a society we need to make it easier for people to do that,” he said. “People can get stuck in a rut and think it’s too late to change their ways, but what we find is that when people do change their ways, we see remarkable benefits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07b37a3919355ff8c4bdec3e250172246727e929/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=298463e0a424dedd8c7621861a25e77b","title":"high end bong art glass blowing cannabis marijuana","story":"Expensive glass-blown pipes have evolved as an American folk art in the illegal market. Will legalization bring it into the light?Below Kyle Tracey’s flatscreen TV there’s a velociraptor skeleton, perhaps 3ft long, in a hunting crouch. The mouthpiece is beneath a removable section of the tail. Tracey estimates the elaborate bong would sell for $20,000 to $30,000.Hanging on a nearby wall is a roughly full-sized glass lion skull encircled by a spiky mane – a tribute to Cecil, the slaughtered lion. The pipe, made by the same high-end bongmaker as the dinosaur, doubles as a lamp the skull detaches for smoking. Its estimated value is $50,000.Tracey, a marijuana entrepreneur, has collected glass pipes since he was a teenager. But calling his most cherished and valuable pieces “pipes” is a bit like calling Fabergé Eggs “paperweights”.Exquisite and expensive glass pieces like these make up only a tiny fraction of a multibillion-dollar industry for marijuana accessories, but the market is bound to grow as consumers grow less shy about keeping attractive pipes on display. Like many aspects of cannabis culture, glassmaking for many years belonged to young men who weren’t inclined to talk about it. Many faced legal risks. Drug paraphernalia laws remain on the books in many states and federally, though they now tend to be less strictly enforced. Within the crucible of an illegal market, glassmakers forged a new American folk art, a kind of sculptural jazz. From a nearby table Tracey grabbed a clear bong, about a foot high, by Quave CB in Seattle. It wouldn’t stand out on a head shop shelf, but when he pulled on the mouthpiece, the water circulated as if the plumbing had been designed by MC Escher ($30,000). Known as a Klein Recycler, the style pays tribute to Felix Klein, a pioneer of non-Euclidean geometry who theorized the existence of a bottle which contains itself.The artist behind the velociraptor and Cecil, Ryan “Buck” Harris who is best known by his Instagram handle, @buckglass, specializes in “super on point and intricate skeletons”, Tracey said.Despite their skill, and their hypnotic craft, glassmakers have been held at arm’s length by much of the legal cannabis world.Young misfits wielding blowtorches do not fit the image the industry hopes to project, no matter how ingenious or exuberant their work. The glassmakers, moreover, are easy to group with the hippies and smelly headshops which ambitious brands targeting young professionals deride. This schism got an online airing last year when Alan Gertner, the CEO of a hipster cannabis brand called Tokyo Smoke, belittled the glass subculture. “There’s basically only ever been one pipe,” he said. “It’s like you can smoke out of this small glass dragon or our larger format glass dragon.” The dig came during a promotional video for a $13,000 bong 3D printed out of stainless steel, and glass aficionados reminded him that you don’t make a $13,000 bong out of steel, because the smoke will pick up an undesirable metallic taste. For the new generation of consumers, there’s a new class of attractive pipe, which follows the clean lines and familiar precepts of well-thought-out design but lacks the unruly trippiness or visceral appeal of more “traditional” glass bongs.One of the most influential American designers of the last 50 years is a glassworker named Bob Snodgrass, who followed the Grateful Dead for much of the 1970s and 1980s, and is credited with adapting lampmaking techniques to make smoking devices. Work by his followers can be found in every stripmall smoke shop and in the hands of any stoner who has ever proudly showed off a new piece.Myriad styles have emerged. Hot glass can be flattened, twisted, bent, punctured, sealed, tweezed, sculpted, turned and so much else. The finished products can be juvenile, timeless or both.Like tattooing, an underground artform that has gone mainstream, glasswork has created an opportunity for those with talent and hustle, but not school or connections, to live on their own terms. Six years ago, Dustin Scarfpin, now 28, was a construction worker in South Carolina specializing in marble and granite, when he saw a documentary featuring Snodgrass called “Degenerate Art”. It inspired him to move to New Jersey and enroll in a rare academic program in glass art. Today, he has a studio and practice in Philadelphia, where he specializes in bongs embedded with drawings of inebriated cartoon characters, like the Simpsons. They sell for between $1,000 and $1,400.Two years ago, at the end of a long winter day, Scarfpin was making cat and frog molds when a string of hot glass got away from him, whipped under his eyeglasses, pierced his left eyelid and shattered inside his eye.“It was a bad day altogether,” he said with unpracticed nonchalance. He seems not to have had any trepidation about returning to his hazardous art. Exquisite pieces like those Tracey collects represent a small section of the market, but it has begun to attract attention.“This is amazing art and no one has seen it,” said Benjamin Milstein, a 23-year-old who goes by Mr Grey. Milstein, who dropped out of college to become a glass gallerist and broker, said that when he first encountered this world six years ago, the most expensive pipe you might see was $5,000. Today pieces and collaborations by top artists can go for more than $100,000.Soon, Tracey said, they’ll be on display at Sotheby’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd1c3033c7e5edfdedfcbed8b7481ccb2987c9b/0_53_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ccabfdb22d5c7503df467405f2dcf74","title":"wealthy professionals most likely to drink alcohol regularly figures show","story":"British manual workers drink the least and middle-aged have most harmful habits, reports sayHigh earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures.Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked.The data, from the the Office for National Statistics Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, shows that in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked.How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65.When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from earlier work in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day.The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts.

It may now be possible to write a nostalgic piece about T20 cricket. Perhaps we should alert Radio 4’s Sue MacGregor to the notion of reliving the creation of T20 back at the start of the century on The Reunion.On the evening of Friday 13 June, 2003, the competition was launched around the counties. I was at Taunton along with more than five thousand others to watch Somerset play Warwickshire (cue soundtrack of Mary Hopkin in full flow remembering how we laughed away the hours and dreamed of all the great things we would do).When Somerset were batting, chasing 189 for victory, I went down to the Warwickshire dugout to chat to their coach, John Inverarity. He is the Australian who padded up to the last ball of the 1968 Oval Test match at about the same time as Mary Hopkin was adorning Top of the Pops. Inverarity was, and still is, one of the great thinkers about the game, the nearest equivalent to Mike Brearley among Australian cricketers, and I was intrigued to discover what he thought about this new format.Of course I never found out there and then. There was no time for such discussion. Inverarity is the most civilised of men, a former head teacher and stimulating company, but he had other things on his mind. There was a game of cricket to be won and that was what he was concentrating on. He winced he even swore when a catch went down or a misfield was committed and this most decorous of Aussies may even have punched the air when a wicket fell. This was not “hit and giggle” which was how David Lloyd always used to describe T20. It was a proper contest, albeit an unusually short one.This was when it became apparent to me that this brash new format might work. Even more important than the coaches desperately wanting to win was the fact the players did as well. They did not want to be ridiculed by all those packed into the stands and they understandably relished playing in front of a proper crowd. It was not the face painting or the DJs that made T20 work it was the cricket and the contest.On that evening in Taunton Warwickshire, shrewdly led by Nick Knight, won by 19 runs with Collins Obuya from Kenya taking three for 16, an early sign that wrist-spinners, against all expectation, might actually prosper in this format. Inverarity was delighted.Back in 2002 there had, of course, been much debate about the wisdom of this new-fangled competition. The counties voted – and on this occasion it was a “free” vote since I have no recall of a guaranteed £1.3m per annum for those ready to agree with the ECB – and the margin in favour of T20 was slim, 11-7 with Middlesex, Sussex, Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Somerset, Glamorgan and Northamptonshire voting against.No expense had been spared and very few details overlooked by the England and Wales Cricket Board in their efforts to sell this new idea. The press were taken off to Spain for a two-day seminar about several aspects of the game but the crunch for the ECB was selling T20. This was all superbly organised and minutely planned.There was even an opportunity to play golf at Valderrama, of which Lord MacLaurin, then chairman of the board, was a member. That beautiful course had never before witnessed so many ugly hacks (I refer solely to the golf shots attempted) in a single afternoon.All of which was quite a contrast to the announcement of the latest format of the game to be hatched by the ECB, which was delivered almost a fortnight ago via a surprise media release followed by a hastily arranged conference call.We knew what the plans were back in 2002. This time we know that the scoreboard is going to be simplified, apparently so that women and children can understand what is going on, but we have no idea how the tournament will be accommodated into the fixture list. What will happen to the unfortunates who are not required by the eight new teams? They could be playing 50-over cricket, T20 among the counties, Championship cricket in two isions or in a conference system. A working party under Wasim Khan has just been set up to ponder all this. All we know is that the new tournament must happen because the ECB has sold those rights to the broadcasters.In response to all the ridicule of the new format the ECB has reeled out some of its senior employees from Joe Root and Eoin Morgan downwards and there is the tacit suggestion that any opposition to the scheme stems from the sort of stick-in-the-mud attitude that was prevalent back in 2002, even though the majority of today’s players (but not the ones employed centrally) have their doubts. “What are they doing at the ECB? It’s actually embarrassing” was the unprovoked response of one senior county cricketer and he is not alone.The parallel with 2002 does not work, by the way. Whether you liked it or not, the idea of T20 cricket in 2002 was a genuinely radical change to the game, which was to have global consequences. By contrast the changes that have been outlined this April are mostly cosmetic, designed to keep the counties and the broadcasters happier: a reduction of 20 balls, a gimmicky 10-ball over: a new scoreboard.There is also the suggestion of getting rid of lbws, which would actually make a huge difference to the way players bat and which would become another blow to bowlers – but the lbw dismissal is apparently too complicated and all we want is more sixes. How about getting rid of the stumps as well?Call me an old traditionalist but I prefer the good old T20 that works so well all around the world, as we kept hearing from Morgan and co – until last week. I actually prefer just one of those tournaments in a domestic summer, as is also the case everywhere else. But I may have mentioned that before.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

The names, whether famous or not, are a reminder that nothing lasts forever, that even the fiercest warriors have a finite shelf life. In the case of the Premiership, according to Damian Hopley of the Rugby Players’ Association, the average life- is seven to eight years. Those who last more than a decade can count themselves lucky.This year’s crop of retirees in Europe has stirred some particularly strong emotions and rightly so. Worcester’s Donncha O’Callaghan was one of the few left with experience of club rugby in the 20th century. Bryan Habana, Juan Martín Hernández, Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe, Jamie Heaslip, Schalk Brits, Tom Croft, John Muldoon … in their differing ways all of them were inspirational figures who will be hugely missed.All one can do is cling to the memories. In the mind’s eye a youthful Croft is sprinting unstoppably away at Twickenham to announce himself for Leicester in the 2007 Anglo‑Welsh final and showing world-class gas in an England jersey to carve up France in Paris in 2012. At his best he had everything: pace, athleticism, bravery and modesty. When the good guys also happen to be great players it is a special combination.The same can be said of Brits, who has single-handedly redefined what a hooker should be capable of. The South African won 10 Springbok caps but will be remembered primarily for the infectious joie de vivre he brought to the game. These things are not always measurable but would Saracens have been so successful for so long without such characters making the working lives of others so enjoyable?Into this feelgood category also comes the 39-year-old O’Callaghan, not least on the famous occasion when he enticed 12 ducks into the Munster team-room with a trail of cornflakes. Beneath the surface, though, lurked an athlete constantly seeking to make the best of himself. “Talk to anyone at Worcester and they’ll tell you about the positive influence he has had and the hole he will leave behind, as a person as much as a rugby player,” Hopley says.O’Callaghan, though, is one of the fortunate few, able to depart on his own terms, comforted by the heart-warming photo of his children in the jerseys he himself has worn down the years. Many do not enjoy that luxury, a subject Hopley found himself discussing with James Haskell last week. “We were talking about how few athletes there are who, to use James’s wonderful expression, get carried out of the ground on their shields when it’s all over,” Hopley says.“Psychologically, that sets you up very differently for retirement from the guy who goes out the back door with half his leg hanging off, battling for his medical costs and insurance. It has an impact on your self-esteem which is probably the hardest thing to come to terms with when you hang up your boots and hand back the car keys.”Those in the latter category such as Wasps’ Sam Jones, injured during a judo grappling session on England duty, also find themselves wrenched away from the people who understand them best. “When they asked Donncha at the weekend what he’d miss most he said the boys and the environment,” adds Hopley. “I think that’s the thing people struggle to understand. You belong and then suddenly you don’t belong. You know that day is coming but you want to keep it at arm’s length for as long as possible. We can’t all be Simon Shaw who played for 20 years.”Everything is strictly relative, of course. Whatever the trials and tribulations of the retiring player they are as nothing compared with the numbness still afflicting the family of Ian Williams, the 27-year-old Doncaster prop who collapsed in training in February and tragically could not be resuscitated. It is also true, however, that the pro game grows ever more intense and the worrying injury stats recently revealed for the 2016-17 season have caused significant disquiet among players, not least the reported higher injury rates associated with artificial pitches.Increasingly it is not so much the pitch itself as the transition – soft to hard, hard to soft – between different surfaces which is being blamed for certain injuries. “Talking to a number of England players they’re very anti artificial pitches, particularly around transition,” Hopley says. “You get a feeling we should probably be looking at one agreed surface for everyone to play on. All home teams aspire to a competitive advantage but maybe that should be about the crowd and the atmosphere, not the surface.”Excessive contact during training sessions is the other key area being monitored. “Going round the clubs, particularly in a post-Lions season, it is clear the game’s demands are increasing,” says Hopley. “We just want to educate the players on the fragility of their careers and their expected . We all recognise rugby is a very physical game but it’s a matter of how we can fine-tune it. I feel a bit like Alan Turing wrestling with the Enigma Code.” For the sake of future generations, let us pray someone cracks it soon.As we wait to see who Harlequins will choose as their next director of rugby it will be fascinating to see if the club’s board look overseas or opt for an up-and-coming English coach. As Exeter and Newcastle are proving, it is entirely possible for Premiership clubs to thrive with English coaches at the helm, rather than simply dialling the mobile number of the next New Zealand coach off the rank. Someone such as Ben Ryan, a gold medal-winning Olympic sevens coach with Fiji, could be an excellent choice if Quins want an intelligent, ambitious coach bursting with good ideas and an instinctive grasp of what needs to be done. No disrespect to the Crusaders’ enthusiastic Scott Robertson but if the Premiership simply becomes a finishing school for Super Rugby graduates where is the next generation of homegrown national coaches going to come from?Sale v Leicester. After 13 successive years of top-four qualification the Tigers have finished outside the play-off positions and, depending on results on the final weekend, could yet miss out on European qualification entirely. Sale, conversely, need to win to put themselves in contention for Champions Cup rugby next season. It has been a long winter but no one in Salford this Saturday will be coasting half-heartedly towards the finish line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62dd3f747d9f252a0d236a734c621464978c1766/0_3264_5739_3441/master/5739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a08a7113a5edf9c2a9054107c2481f7","title":"puerile provincial and prophetic how the inbetweeners became a classic","story":"It had a lukewarm reception when it debuted 10 years ago, but Damon Beesley and Iain Morris’s show about suburban school friends has become that rare thing: a national-treasure sitcomWhen The Inbetweeners pitched up in 2008, there hadn’t been a hit British sitcom about teenagers since The Young Ones. In the US, teens existed in glossy California dramas or gross-out coming of age movies. In Britain, they featured in gritty films and series about crime and, more alarmingly, Skins – E4’s romp through the untowardly eventful lives of a gaggle of pill-popping, sexually reckless 16-year-olds. It was into this lopsided landscape that The Inbetweeners arrived and injected television’s teenage narrative with a dose of pure, unadulterated ordinariness.Narrated by goody-two-shoes teenager Will (Simon Bird), the show follows his move from private school to bog-standard comprehensive, where he makes bog-standard new friends. He meets perpetually lovelorn Simon (Joe Thomas), chronic bullshitter Jay (James Buckley) and nice-but-dim Neil (Blake Harrison). Iain Morris, who co-created the show with Damon Beesley, said he wanted suburbia to be the show’s fifth main character, and the overwhelming mediocrity of The Inbetweeners’ grey-skied commuter-belt setting is reflected in everything from the soundtrack (landfill indie) to the characters’ ambitions (try to get served in a pub).In many ways, The Inbetweeners was a very conventional sitcom, complete with slapstick scrapes and slickly concluded storylines. Cleaving to British comedy tradition, its on-screen leads, Bird and Thomas, were alumni of the Cambridge Footlights, and it stuck to age-old sitcom tropes like antagonism-glazed male bonding and romantic humiliation. But into this template, Morris and Beesley injected real life. From Simon’s humiliatingly yellow car to Jay’s pretend sexual exploits, the creators packed the show full of their real-life experiences (fans of Morris’s and Jimmy Carr’s mid-00s XFM show will remember the writer as a source of superb adolescence anecdotes). They also took care to mimic the way teenage boys spoke. Doing so meant The Inbetweeners broke new ground when it came to the level of crudity you would expect from a prime-time sitcom. But it worked. The Inbetweeners Movie took £13.22m at the UK box office on its opening weekend. (The most successful TV comedy spin-off before that was Borat, which managed £6.24m.) Its success was staggering and triggered a Gaelic TV and film renaissance when its Skye-based producer Chris Young used the money he had made to start Gaelic-language projects.This puerility made The Inbetweeners easy to dismiss, however its juvenility belied not only expertly constructed comedy, but lexical joy. Like every great sitcom, The Inbetweeners created its own language – popularising terms such as clunge, bus wanker and “friend” (the latter is all in the high-pitched delivery). It feels as if The Inbetweeners was the last comedy to permeate the cultural consciousness of young Britons in this way. Its dialogue passed into common parlance and its characters became archetypes (Jay, in particular, is useful shorthand for a whole category of human). That’s probably because it was broadcast at a time when the TV comedy as a unifying cultural touchstone was steadily disintegrating. Digital channels hadn’t totally poleaxed the concept of the national-treasure sitcom yet (Gavin \u0026amp Stacey, which debuted the year before on BBC Three, was similarly big news), but in the coming years streaming soon would – Netflix was introduced in the UK in 2012 – and viewership would fragment.The turn of the decade was a pivotal moment for television in general, but it was especially important for comedy. As blockbuster sitcoms died away, a new style of comedy was taking its place – one that focused on the people who always played the boring characters: women. As a show about failure, disappointment and rejection, it feels faintly ridiculous to view The Inbetweeners as a tale of four middle-class white men and their privilege, but it is true that the show seemed to put more effort into thinking up slang terms for vagina than giving depth to its female characters. Which makes one facet of The Inbetweeners’ legacy even odder: it created a template for the female-centric sitcom to thrive. Shows such Derry Girls, Some Girls and Drifters (whose leads appeared in the first The Inbetweeners Movie, and is executive-produced by Morris and Beesley) have all been referred to as the “female Inbetweeners”, while Caroline and Caitlin Moran’s sister-sitcom Raised By Wolves picked up where the masturbation-obsessed teen boys left off. Without the original, these shows might never have been possible – they flipped the script that The Inbetweeners wrote.The Inbetweeners also existed at a particular point in teenage life. When it began in 2008, Facebook had just about taken root in the social lives of teenagers the show’s final episode aired 12 days before the launch of Instagram. The latter overhauled teenage life, making adolescents cautious curators of their own image. Teen years no longer seem like a place for fashion sins and horrendous character-building scrapes but a prime time to start building your brand. You probably couldn’t make a show about teenagers today without having social media at its core. For that reason, The Inbetweeners seems like a harbinger of the end of two eras: both as one of the UK’s final sitcom phenomena, and a portrait of a humiliating, awkward and tedious paradise lost.The Inbetweeners is available on All 4 throughout May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/250bcb3f8f6a58551e95c44569fbb50af686ef4c/0_185_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8870561690ebaee1baae7fd71de493ef","title":"labour backs push for public ownership registers in uk overseas territories","story":"Shadow chancellor says government needs to show it is serious about clamping down on tax avoidance Labour’s frontbench has asked its MPs to support a backbench amendment that would force Theresa May to tell Britain’s overseas territories to introduce public ownership registers in an attempt to prevent them from being exploited by the global super-rich.The party’s three line whip backing for the amendment, which has attracted the support of 20 rebel Conservatives, makes it more likely that the government will be defeated on the transparency measure in the Commons on Tuesday.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the government needed to show it was “serious about clamping down on tax avoidance and taking on the vested interests of the super rich” by supporting the backbench amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill.Its proponents, Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and Labour MP Margaret Hodge, argue that if the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are forced to introduce public ownership registers it will stem the flow of “dirty money” around the world and into the UK.They say that “transparency is vital in the fight against money laundering and tax avoidance by crooks, kleptocrats and terrorist gangs” in a joint article for the Evening Standard. Campaign group Global Witness estimates that £68bn flowed out of Russia via the UK overseas territories between 2007 and 2016.David Cameron and George Osborne promised to introduce public ownership registers in the overseas territories in 2013 but the measure was dropped when May took over as prime minister. The amendment, which has the support of Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, as well as the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, asks the 14 territories to comply by the end of 2020.Number 10 has said it will study whether the proposed amendment will be effective, although government whips had suggested that implementation could be delayed until 2025 in an attempt to peel off the rebels that Mitchell insisted had not been successful.Opposition to the measure in the overseas territories has been led by the British Virgin Islands. The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), of which the BVI is an associate member, said it was unfair to target the BVI at a time when the region is recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma.Allen Chastanet, the prime minister of Saint Lucia and chairman of the OECS, added there was an an “ongoing frustration” among member states at “having to continually battle the unilateral shifting of goal posts on the financial services front”. The OECS also complained that the amendment did not target the UK crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and so appeared to “specifically target the Caribbean” – although MPs supporting the amendment said they hoped to turn to the crown dependencies in due course.Labour also said it intended to campaign further on the issue and unveiled a series of “internet posters” with the strapline: “Hostile Environment? Not for Tory donors” which it intended to promote online in the belief that it can successfully attack the government on this issue.Duncan Hames, director of policy at anti-corruption campaign group Transparency International UK, added: “Without leaks like the Panama and Paradise Papers, it is increasingly clear that only public registers can provide the accountability to expose corrupt iniduals seeking to hide their identities and sources of wealth.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475072.1525171025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"can gaeltach schools be saved from extinction","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Clodagh Ní Mhaoilchiaráin, principal of Ghaelscoil Bhaile Brigín.

Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyIs the Gaeltacht facing extinction? The number of native speakers has been in decline for years, and a stark 2014 report warned that early exposure to English is damaging the standard of Irish among the Gaeltacht’s children. Some believe this could be the last generation of native Irish speakers.Outside the Gaeltacht, however, Irish-medium Gaelscoileanna are thriving and don’t have enough places to meet demand.So, why is the language doing better outside its last remaining stronghold? And is there any way back for the Gaeltacht?“The numbers speaking Irish as a living, everyday language are in decline,” says Bláthnaid Ní Ghréacháin, chief executive of Gaeloideachas, a voluntary organisation that supports the development of Irish-medium schools. “There’s a perception that everyone who lives in the Gaeltacht is an Irish speaker but, in reality, there is a linguistic crisis.”One of the challenges for the Irish language is that English dominates in interactions outside the classroom. “It takes a lot of leadership from school management, board and parents to encourage Irish to be spoken in the yard, in the classroom and outside the classroom. So many resources are in English and social media is in English too. “We also need to make sure that there are avenues for children to use the language when socialising and playing sports. We have a tendency to see schools as the saviour of the language but there have to be other supports and infrastructure.”Within the Gaeltacht, some schools in which Irish was nominally the language of instruction had been drifting, almost by default, towards English.“If you live in the Gaeltacht and wanted your child taught through English, you have to seek out an English-medium school, whereas outside the Gaeltacht, it is an active, conscious decision to have your child educated as Gaeilge,” says Ní Ghréacháin. “In every school there are learners, speakers and people with different degrees of Irish, so teachers found it hard to do immersion education.”A new policy has been introduced whereby Irish-medium schools in the Gaeltacht apply to get recognition and special supports.It came 12 years after a report in 2004 which found that almost half of children attending Gaeltacht schools did not have any better competency in Irish than the majority English-speaking population. Under this new system, primary schools seeking recognition as Gaeltacht schools will have to teach solely through Irish for junior and senior infants. Advocates for the language believe it could be a game-changer.“These are the two years where sanctuary is provided for Irish, and it’s proven internationally as the most effective model of bilingual education,” says Ní Ghréacháin. “But a big challenge is that the majority of Gaeltacht schools may only have two or three teachers, so one teacher may be delivering four different classes.“How can they implement an immersion policy if the infant classes are hearing English when the teacher talks to the first and second class beside them? “The policies to address this will be crucial we know that schools will be granted some extra teaching hours but we wait to see the detail. Ideally, we would have a greater pupil-teacher ratio. “One strategy used by some schools is to wait until the junior and senior infant classes have gone home at 1.30pm and then teach the older classes English in the remaining time.”Anna Ní Chartúir is president of Gaeloideachas, which represents the Irish-medium and Gaeltacht education sector, and she is also a teacher at Scoil Sailearna in Indreabhán. Prior to this , she was the principal of a two-teacher school which closed due to dwindling numbers.“There are clear benefits to exposing the children to Irish for two years: they will have better competence and understanding of the entire curriculum,” she says. “We also know that bilingually competent children are much better at picking at a third language.”The Department of Education says uptake among schools for the new recognition scheme has been very strong, with the vast majority opting into the scheme.It says dedicated funding has been doubled from €1 million to €2 million, along with additional language support hours which are equivalent to providing an extra 40 whole-time teachers. The new policy alone won’t save the language, however. Ní Chartúir points to a shortage of teachers, particularly at post-primary level, who can deliver the curriculum through Irish. “The Leaving Cert syllabus for Irish in Gaeltacht schools needs to be revised as a matter of urgency, and there will need to be continued, targeted supports given to Gaeltacht schools including additional teaching hours, continuous professional development and, critically, teaching resources in the Irish language. “We also need occupational therapists, psychologists, speech and language therapists with proficiency in Irish.”Many of Ní Chartúir’s suggestions aren’t particularly expensive: one option is simply to expand the number of teachers trained through Irish currently, NUI Galway’s master’s in education through Irish is oversubscribed. People want to teach through Irish, and yet schools struggle to get them.“We saw recently that Gaelscoileanna (Irish-speaking schools outside the Gaeltacht) may prioritise children from Irish-speaking families in their enrolment policies,” says Ní Ghréacháin. “This is because there is demand. People appreciate the language, even passively. People want to keep it alive, and parents are really engaged.”However, getting a Gaelscoil off the ground is a challenge, as the Department of Education decides on patronage based on what the majority in the area want, meaning that new Irish-speaking schools will often be in the minority. “A competitive tender process is not supportive of Irish medium education” says Ní Ghréacháin. “The department needs to recognise this.”A problem for the Irish-medium education is the perception that children with special needs are not welcomed, or that they won’t be able to cope. Clodagh Ní Mhaolchiaráin, principal of Gaelscoil Bhaile Brigín in Balbriggan, Co Dublin, disputes this and says bilingualism and immersion education has benefits for children with additional learning needs.“My specialist area is children who are on the autism spectrum in Irish-medium schools,” she says.“We have two thriving autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classes as well as children with speech and language difficulties, vision issues, dyslexia, dyscalculia and more. We identify the child’s needs before they start school and intervene early.“National and international studies show that these children do as well in bilingual education settings indeed, being bilingual can help them with ergent thinking and may be especially good for children with autism. This can be the best option for many children.”While there are concerns among some that all-Irish education can hold some students back, native speakers such as Mairéad Ní Chuaig, who presents a travel show on TG4, says bi-lingualism actually improve academic performance.“I went on to learn Italian in college. There are huge benefits to being bilingual once you have two languages, learning a third is easier.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, came to the Border again and crossed it but first had to deny that the “backstop” option for the post-Brexit frontier was an EU land grab for Northern Ireland.The suggestion, in a question from a journalist with the pro-Brexit Daily , shows the extent to which the political noise in London around the negotiations on Britain’s departure is making Barnier’s job so difficult.“We have no intention of questioning the UK’s constitutional order,” Barnier told the All-Island Civic Forum on Brexit in Dundalk. “This is none of our business.”Almost two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and less than a year until its departure, nobody is any clearer about what Brexit means for the Border – and the temperature around Brexit is still too high to figure it out.Barnier, on his second visit to the Border since Brexit, said this was exactly why he had come to visit both sides of the Border: to find “technical and practical solutions to assure safety controls” that protect the EU’s single market and, he suggested, the UK’s internal market too.“We have to de-dramatise this point to avoid any kind of ideology,” he said.“There is absolutely no question of Ireland or the European Union being interested in a land grab,” stressed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, sharing a stage with Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney.The clock is ticking down to the next critical deadline in the Brexit negotiations, the European Council summit of EU leaders at the end of June, and the issue of how to maintain an invisible border remains unresolved.So far, the only solution on the negotiating table is the backstop, the default position that will effectively keep Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market.It is an option the UK has agreed to and conceded should be covered by a legal text in the Brexit treaty, but it does not want it and has so far failed to agree to the legal text or proposed an alternative acceptable to the EU.In an attempt to keep the pressure on the British to come up with other concrete proposals, Barnier, Varadkar and Coveney displayed a unified line of offence here near the Border. The three were “absolutely united,” the Taoiseach said, in seeking “meaningful progress” by the June summit.Barnier suggested June was a “stepping stone” to October’s deadline for a final Brexit treaty but warned that until there was agreement on an operational backstop, there was “a risk” of a disorderly Brexit.He inadvertently had a dig at Davis when he took a question from a Northern Irish journalist about Davis believing the backstop wasn’t necessary.“Who?” he asked, not quite catching the Northern accent. The backstop was there not to change the UK’s red lines (leaving the EU single market and customs union), he replied, but “because of the UK’s red lines”.The heaviest punches were thrown by Opposition politicians during the forum’s plenary session.Labour leader Brendan Howlin referred to the “civil war” that had erupted in the UK Tory party over Brexit. Independent Alliance Minister Shane Ross suggested that England’s difficulty should be Ireland’s opportunity.“If they insist on imposing this self-inflicted wound, it is probably something that we can take advantage of,” he said, pointing to the opportunities for financial services and tourism.While Barnier wants no drama, no visit to the Border area by anyone so connected with Brexit could avoid it.Hours before his visit, DUP leader Arlene Foster questioned Barnier’s honesty as a broker. He was “not ready to engage in polemics,” Barnier replied, calmly.For some hard Brexiteers, they do not seem ready to move beyond them.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480154.1525167423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lord kilclooney accused of racism after calling taoiseach typical indian","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLord Kilclooney claimed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar “constantly antagonises Unionist feelings and is damaging the improved NorthSouth relations”.Veteran unionist politician John Taylor, now Lord Kilclooney, has been accused of making racist remarks on social media after he referred to Leo Varadkar as a “typical Indian”.Responding to a tweet from BBC Newsline that featured the headline “DUP: Varadkar’s visit to Northern Ireland showed ‘disrespect’”, Lord Kilclooney tweeted on Monday afternoon the Taoiseach was a “typical Indian”. When asked to explain the term “typical Indian”, Lord Kilclooney wrote it was “typical of this particular half Indian”.He continued: “No Irish PM has previously ignored the normal courtesies of visiting the UK.The 80-year-old peer defended his use of the term Indian, saying Mr Varadkar was “racially a half Indian and proud of it” and that there was “nothing racist about it - simply factual”.He tweeted: “It is not racially abusive as he himself has confirmed he is half Indian. That is great and not to be dismissed as Indians are a great race. However he has damaged NorthSouth relations by being continually offensive and provocative to the Unionist majority in NIreland.”Alliance Party leader Naomi Long tweeted that Lord Kilclooney’s language was “a racial slur, insulting of not only the Taoiseach and the Irish people, but of Indian people too. There is no explaining this one away like last time.”Ms Long called for the House of Lords to address Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour on social media. “It is deliberate, calculated disrespect,” she wrote.Former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt also accused Lord Kilclooney of racist language, using the #NotInMyName in a tweet. Sinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile tweeted that he was planning to ask the Seanad Cathaoirleach to contact the Speaker of the House of Lords “urging him to take appropriate action regarding yet another offensive tweet from a member of the House of Lords regarding An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar”.DUP member Christopher Stalford tweeted: “I don’t know what John Taylor thinks he’s playing at but he doesn’t speak for me. Absolutely ridiculous behaviour.”Alliance Party councillor Emmet McDonough Brown tweeted that “reducing someone to their race denies their humanity \u0026amp agency and lays prejudice bare. Every generation has to stand against racism and this pound-shop bore should know better by now.”A spokesman for the House of Lords press office said Lord Kilclooney’s behaviour would only be investigated if they received complaints that he had breached the House of Lords Code of Conduct. If a complaint is raised, the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards would undertake an independent investigation of the alleged breaches, he said. The House of Lords code of conduct states that members must always act “on their personal honour”. It notes that “members cannot rely simply on their own personal sense of what is honourable. They are required to act in accordance with the standards expected by the House as a whole”.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3479500.1525112908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"with no sense of direction theresa may is the plaything of events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May arrives for a visit to Brooklands Primary School in Sale, near Manchester, on Monday as part of the Conservative Party’s local election campaign. Photograph: Oli ScarffPA WireFive years after her arrival in parliament, Amber Rudd was given the UK energy department to run. Her credentials for such a strategic role in a $2.9 trillion economy were her sound intellect and common sense. An unquantifiable hunch that she was doing well spurred her promotion to the Home Office a year later, where she had to master another wad of detail from scratch. On Sunday, she resigned over the mistreatment of the Windrush migrants, or rather a false statement about the policy behind it.The light-speed rise and fall, the intellectual generalism tested to destruction, the almost holy significance put on matters of communication: Rudd’s was the echt career in British politics. It could only be more typical of our public life if she returns to cabinet before long with another portfolio to wing her way through. Her replacement, Sajid Javid, who is running his fourth department in as many years, should be on his fifth by then.The British state is set up for low-key shambles. What permanence there is resides in a civil service that has interests, if not beliefs, of its own. Indeed, Conservatives wonder about the source of the leak that did for Rudd.A good prime minister can withstand these administrative fumbles and 10-a-penny resignations by espousing a central mission. Margaret Thatcher weathered crises as serious as the Westland affair because her quest for economic reform put them in perspective as transient news stories. Theresa May has no quest beyond Brexit and her own survival. There is little in the way of a domestic policy programme. Parliament is scrutinising such momentous legislation as the Civil Liability Bill, with its new measures against vexatious motor insurance claims. In the air is the kind of listlessness that attends the ninth year of a premiership. It is the second year of May’s.Having promised to stand for more than Brexit, the prime minister has managed to stand for less (given her constructive ambiguity on even that question). Her circumstances provide her with good excuses. Without a majority in either house of parliament, she cannot venture any contentious bills. Without the political capital to fire senior ministers, she cannot impose herself on government. While talks with the EU proceed, she cannot devote herself to anything else. Nor does her legislative inhibition have to be a problem for the nation. There are worse things than an inactive government, such as an active government. Savour this break from do-somethingism, the most righteous religion of our time, while it lasts.The problem is for May herself. With no sense of direction, she is the plaything of events. Each resignation – there have been five in six months – matters more than it should. Losses in the local elections this week would be no trouble to brush off for a prime minister with projects of their own to pursue. In May’s case, losses will renew gossip about her position.The Windrush scandal is traceable to decisions taken before Rudd’s time. Critics say that May’s own tenure at the Home Office is returning to dog her. They cannot know how right they are.The Home Office is a (necessarily) negative department. Its job is to stop bad things from happening, of which crime, terror and illegal immigration are the most serious. In her six years in that confoundingly avant garde building, May never had to create, only enforce. It is life-and-death work but inadequate preparation for Downing Street, to which parliament and the executive look for drive.There have been prime ministers of her reticent type before but they tend to be paired with a more dynamic chancellor of the exchequer. May has Philip Hammond, who compounds her own caution. The result is a government that avoids outright crisis in favour of ennui and drift. A very small mercy, that. May’s admirers still talk about her debut speech as prime minister as though Cicero is up there kicking himself for having been beaten to it. Even at the time, though, it was colour-by-numbers flannel about “burning injustice”, influenced by advisers who are no longer with her. She was never a seer. She was a conscientious, civic-minded politician who needs instructions to be getting on with.That was what Britain required in the summer of 2016, when zanier Tories were vying for power after the Brexit vote. But there are diminishing returns to mere diligence. Rudd’s departure would be a non-event for a busier prime minister. It matters to this one, but then so does every glancing blow. Britain can live without a governing vision. Whether May can is less clear. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle star in \u0026#39loving, informal\u0026#39 official Royal wedding coinDominican Republic cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in victory for ChinaVictory for commuters as train company designs \u0026#39comfortable\u0026#39 seats following \u0026#39ironing board\u0026#39 complaintsAge Concern chief executive stole £700,00 from charity by paying cheques into his account, court hearsNorth Koreans speak of hope of unification as propaganda speakers dismantledThe UK\u0026#39s first free beach water refill station is installedSolicitor struck off after he headbutted rival at High Court in property battleLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watch\u0026#39Soft Brexit\u0026#39 still leaves room for trade deals, Iceland\u0026#39s foreign minister suggestsGreen groups warn of maritime \u0026#39Chernobyl\u0026#39 as Russia launches floating nuclear power plantDonald Trump delays steel tariff decision for UK and other allies until JuneTheresa May considering agreement with Brussels that Brexiteers fear would be \u0026#39EU Mark II\u0026#39 \u0026#39Subversive\u0026#39 Peppa Pig removed from online video platform in ChinaIsraeli spies stole half a tonne of secret nuclear documents from Iran \u0026#39in a single night\u0026#39Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes - all you need to know about the game updateHow bad could the local elections be for the Conservatives in London?Brazil fire: Burning tower block collapses in Sao PauloBugs talk to each other to help evade detection We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000161859720_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnYOtYVQOCqg_6-ytWDLcTlY8exg6AK8BnDGSNxV88tY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"amateur daubers like andy murray tonic need against pomposity","story":"A section of Andy Murray\u0026#39s painting – possibly including tennis ballsAndy Murray, the garlanded star of the tennis courts, is not the first famous person to have sought solace in painting.

They are some of the first practical, if small, steps toward reconciliation following Friday\u0027s summit between the leaders of the two nations.As a goodwill gesture ahead of last Friday\u0027s summit, South Korea had turned off its loudspeakers that broadcast a mixture of news, Korean pop songs and criticism of the North Korean regime.The de-escalation in propaganda programmes from both sides come amid rare reports from inside North Korea that suggest the shifting stance towards the South is having an impact.“Right now you can just stop anywhere and hear talk of unification all around you”, a resident of the South Hamgyong Province told the Daily NK news web site.Korean detente How did we get here?Even members of the “hostile class” are holding out hope that change might mean that relatives will be released from the North’s political prison camps.The Daily NK quoted a source in Ryanggang Province as saying that a neighbour has been given renewed hope of seeing her younger sister, who was sent to prison 18 years previously, even though nothing has been heard about her well-being since.“The woman had become really dispirited about her younger sister and lost hope, but now, because of expectations surrounding the inter-Korean summit, they are holding out hope that unification might mean the release of her family members”.Dreams of previously unthinkable freedoms are being tempered by realism, however, with a resident of North Hamgyong Province saying: “Most people are generally quiet, but they have really big expectations for the future. But they also understand that lots of things need to develop a certain way, and then we can all be joyful together”.Despite the speakers being switched off, North Korean defectors in the South continued their campaign of sending water bottles filled with rice and K-pop-loaded USB sticks floating towards their homeland.Jung Gwang-il, a former North Korean political prisoner, and other activists tossed bottles into the sea from an island, hoping the tide will carry them northwards.What is one thing that Kim Jong Un hates the most? he asked. It\u0027s North Koreans becoming aware of the reality.Park Jung-oh, another defector, added: We all lived in North Korea for at least 30, 40 years so we know exactly what the people there want and need, Park said.When they watch the content of our USB sticks, they will realise that they have been tricked by their government, he said.Films and television programmes from abroad have long been banned in the North due to the regime’s fear that it will show its citizens the high living standards of foreigners, while travel abroad was impossible unless a person was willing to take their chances and defect.On Tuesday Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u0027s president, asked the United Nations to help verify North Korea\u0027s planned shutdown of its nuclear test site. Moon made the request in a phone call Tuesday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Yonhap news agency reported.Please review our commenting policyRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle star in \u0026#39loving, informal\u0026#39 official Royal wedding coinDominican Republic cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in victory for ChinaVictory for commuters as train company designs \u0026#39comfortable\u0026#39 seats following \u0026#39ironing board\u0026#39 complaintsAge Concern chief executive stole £700,00 from charity by paying cheques into his account, court hearsThe UK\u0026#39s first free beach water refill station is installedSolicitor struck off after he headbutted rival at High Court in property battleLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watch\u0026#39Soft Brexit\u0026#39 still leaves room for trade deals, Iceland\u0026#39s foreign minister suggestsGreen groups warn of maritime \u0026#39Chernobyl\u0026#39 as Russia launches floating nuclear power plantDonald Trump delays steel tariff decision for UK and other allies until JuneTheresa May considering agreement with Brussels that Brexiteers fear would be \u0026#39EU Mark II\u0026#39 \u0026#39Subversive\u0026#39 Peppa Pig removed from online video platform in ChinaIsraeli spies stole half a tonne of secret nuclear documents from Iran \u0026#39in a single night\u0026#39Fortnite: Battle Royale season 4 skins and Battle Passes -

Many administrative functions will be duplicated meaning some jobs are highly likely to go.Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Conservative MP Mark Menzies, who worked at Asda’s head office for 11 years, told the House of Commons that he did not believe the site would survive a few years after the merger.He added that distribution centres “will be absolutely hammered a year or two years down the line if this merger goes ahead”.For shop-floor staff which make up the majority of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s 350,000 employees the competition watchdog’s investigation will cause concern.In a similar probe when Morrisons bought Safeway in a far smaller deal in 2003, the regulator forced the supermarkets to offload 53 stores.So a Sainsbury’s-Asda probe would surely require the sale of stores in locations where the combined company would limit choice for shoppers. Coupe admitted as much on Friday morning but said he would miraculously not cut jobs as a result. How?“Even if we have to est stores they will be sold as trading entities,” he said. In other words, a rival will buy them and they will stay open.But just who would snap them up? Only Tesco and Morrisons would remain as potential purchasers out of a new “big three” of supermarkets.It’s far from certain they would look to acquire large numbers of stores.The space race that saw supermarkets aggressively add new shops throughout the 2000s, particularly large out-of-town locations, is well and truly over. What the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit Sainsbury’s says Asda merger a win for all. Can customers believe it?Sainsbury’s merger with Asda likely to face competition watchdog probeSainsbury’s grows sales but warns bank profits will take a hit in 2018Sainsbury’s share price soars as it unveils details of Asda mergerCustomers habits have changed. Fewer consumers do one big weekly shop, instead preferring regular trips to convenience stores or shopping online.Aldi and Lidl are adding stores at a rapid rate but much of Asda and Sainsbury’s portfolio is likely to be a bad fit for the discounters, both of which favour smaller, more centrally located shops. Some commentators have touted bargain retailers such as B\u0026ampM as potential purchasers.Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, says it is “inevitable” that the merged company will sell branches and he sees Morrison’s as the prime beneficiary.But it will only buy the profitable stores in good locations that become available. It is too early to say which Sainsbury’s or Asdas will disappear, or even how many, but we can make some guesses. Analysis by Patrick O’Brien, research director at Global Data Retail, found 197 Asda stores that had a Sainsbury’s in the same postcode area (eg PL1). He broke this down further to reveal 75 areas where they are in the same postcode sector (eg: PL1 5). These could be the first for the chop.No plans to close any stores, but with 75 Asda stores in the same postcode district as a Sainsbury’s store (excluding Sainsbury’s Locals) we expect the CMA will demand disposals pic.twitterW2oYyPbr2nOn job cuts, Lim says the merger will speed up a process that has been underway for a decade.“The number of people employed in retail has been shrinking by 1 per cent per year since 2008. The industry doesn’t require as much space and the role of employees is changing.” he said.“If the merger does result in redundancies through being forced to sell stores or through cutting back office teams, ultimately this is about making a company that is fit for purpose in the future with a business model that works.”Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, said that despite what has been stated officially, “stores would have to close”.“That’s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would, of course, be a bad thing for those store employees.”During a debate on the takeover on Monday, Conservative MP Stephen Kerr said the concentration of supermarket power could have a “potentially devastating effect” on suppliers.The two largest players would control 60 per cent of the market, allowing them to dictate terms to an even greater degree than at present.For Sainsbury’s and Asda executives, the logic behind a £10bn supermarket mega-merger is clear – for shoppers, suppliers and workers the positives are less obvious.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

With weaker than anticipated economic conditions and the pound falling again,” said Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, which sponsors the PMI survey.The report, compiled by IHS Markit, also showed that business confidence among manufacturers has fallen to its weakest level in five months, with firms citing concerns about Brexit and possible future trade barriers.The growth of new export business was at its lowest in 10 months and job creation the feeblest in 14 months.Manufacturing accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP and the Office for National Statistics estimated last week that the sector slowed dramatically in the three months to March, expanding by just 0.2 per cent, after booming in the second half of 2017, helped by the weaker pound.The ONS estimated that the UK’s overall GDP growth slumped to 0.1 per cent in the quarter, raising concerns that the economy is now virtually stagnating.Sterling was down 0.58 per cent on the day against the dollar in the wake of the figures at $1.3688.“Markit’s manufacturing survey provides more evidence that the economy has fundamentally slowed this year, strengthening the case even more for the MPC to hold back from raising interest rates later this month,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.In a separate indication that consumer sentiment might also be weakening, the Bank of England on Tuesday reported a drop in the number of mortgage approvals for house purchase in March to 62,914.This was below the 64.544 average for the previous six months, although the snow in the month is likely to have played a role in depressing activity.There was also a sharp slowdown in the rate of credit card borrowing, which rose by just £100m in the month, versus the six month average rate of £600m. The annual rate of borrowing growth dipped to 8.8 per cent, from 9.5 per cent previously.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As such, it mostly functions like the downvote button on Reddit, allowing people to express their dislike of a comment and offset any positive reactions it might be getting.MPs laugh at Facebook boss during intense grilling in parliamentIn doing so, the feature should be able to make conversations on the platform less centred around those comments that generate the most engagement – whether good or bad.Facebook has been struggling with how exactly to integrate a dislike button since at least 2015, when Mark Zuckerberg noted that not every moment is a good moment. He also noted that any feature would have to be carefully designed to avoid spreading negativity or to be used for bullying.To solve that, Facebook introduced its Reactions – allowing people to not only like something, but also to offer a range of other reactions, such as anger or laughter. But doing so introduced yet another problem: reacting angrily still counted as a reaction, and so content that made people upset was still being engaged with and promoted on the site.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It\u0027s clear that the government must develop a national alcohol strategy to address the harm they and their families face, and include treatment at its heart to reduce the suffering of the four in every five who currently do not access the services they need.This report shows very clearly what action is needed and we urge policy-makers, practitioners and service providers to join together to implement these recommendations to help the hundreds of thousands of people who are in desperate need of support.Press Association contributed to this report. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation.

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sterling dropped 0.43 per cent to €1.3723 following Friday’s decline of more than 1 per cent after official figures revealed the UK economy almost slowed to a standstill in the first quarter. Pound falls sharply as UK economy almost grinds to a haltThe pound fell 0.9 per cent against the euro on Friday after the numbers showed UK GDP grew by just 0.1 per cent in the first three months of the year, much worse than expected despite analysts having priced in a slowdown due to the Beast from the East. The figures have heightened fears that a much-anticipated May interest rate rise by the Bank of England might now be off the cards. “The Bank now appears highly unlikely to hike in May, and if the probability for such action continues to drift towards 0 per cent in the coming days, then the pound could remain under pressure,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at forex firm XM. “As always, besides the Bank of England, the other key determinant for sterling will be any updates on Brexit, where the next negotiating round will begin on Wednesday.”Meanwhile, the departure of Ms Rudd from the Home Office has also contributed to making the pound “a little shaky”, said London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler.

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running.

Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade.

I think that when we have taken a decision, we follow it through,” he said.Dr Fox insisted crashing out of the EU with no agreement – a threat repeatedly made by the prime minister – was still on the table, but downgraded it to a “possibility”.He also tried to rule out compromise on the policy of staying out of a customs union with the EU, saying: “We would be in a worse position than we are today.“We would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK, without the UK having a voice.”Lords votes to kill off any prospect of a \u0027no deal\u0027 BrexitBrussels warns Sajid Javid of \u0027concerns\u0027 with EU citizens registerEU gives Britain June deadline on Northern Ireland border issueUK set to offer EU Brexit migration deal \u0027similar\u0027 to free movement\u0027Biggest ever pro-EU march\u0027 promised for referendum on Brexit dealHe added: “A customs union is what Turkey has – it would still leave us accepting rules made by Brussels with no say in how they are made.”Dr Fox hinted strongly that he would resign if the prime minister does give way, refusing to answer the question directly, but adding: “Getting no answer you can draw your own inferences.”When, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, it was put to him that Ms May was a “horribly weakened” prime minister, he replied: “We don\u0027t have a parliamentary majority, that\u0027s for sure. That makes life harder.”The interview came one day before a potentially decisive meeting of the Brexit sub-committee, which will see an attempt by Brexiteers to kill off Ms May’s preferred plan for post-Brexit customs.They fear the “partnership” plan – which would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf – is unworkable and could be used by Brussels as a device to soften Brexit.The alternative “maximum facilitation” option is based on technological solutions to the customs issue but the EU is sceptical that it would ever work.However, Dr Fox acknowledged that neither of the UK proposals would “solve all the problems” of cross-border trade, avoiding a hard Irish border and giving the UK an independent trade policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Cambridge Analytica insisted the Facebook data it received was obtained legally and that it was not used in the Brexit referendum.Mr Banks and Eldon Insurance have denied that the company shared any data with either Leave.EU or with Cambridge Analytica – and insisted the data consultancy did no work for its campaign.AIQ, meanwhile, says it has never been a part of either Cambridge Analytica or SCL, its parent firm, nor entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.However, the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, is investigating both Leave.EU and Mr Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act, issuing “information notices” requiring specified cooperation.Her office also raided Cambridge Analytica’s offices, as part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum.A few days ago, Ms Denham publicly accused AIQ of failing to co-operate with her inquiry, saying: “We are considering the legal steps available to obtain the information.”Of the 87 Facebook users whose personal data was shared with Cambridge Analytica, more than one million live in the UK, the company has acknowledged.“One million people was the margin of the win in the Brexit referendum,” Ms Sandbach pointed out.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But critics cast doubt on whether his words meant an actual change of approach.It was shortly after 10am on Monday that Downing Street announced Mr Javid would take charge of the Home Office from Ms Rudd, who quit amid a row about deportation targets and the Windrush scandal.Critics claim both issues are underpinned by the single-minded drive to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants in the UK – instigated by Ms May when she was home secretary.Theresa May admits there were deportation targets when she was home secretaryWith Mr Javid forced to confront anger over the “hostile environment” approach in the Commons by 4pm, he said: “I don’t like the phrase hostile.“So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a country.”I don’t like the phrase hostile. So the terminology I think is incorrect and I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn’t represent our values as a countryBefore quitting, Ms Rudd was reported to have been livid that she was dealing with the fallout of a broad approach to immigration implemented by Ms May.She was quick to tweet praise for Mr Javid’s opening comments on Monday, calling his appearance an “outstanding debut”.It will not have gone unnoticed in Downing Street that the new home secretary suggested language used by the prime minister for years does not reflect British “values”.He also risked provoking anger at Number 10 by saying he would review the use of “internal migration targets” at the Home Office, before deciding whether they should be kept – just hours after the prime minister gave an interview defending them.Boris Johnson clashes with Theresa May after demanding amnesty for all long-standing Commonwealth immigrantsMs May had said: “When I was home secretary we did have targets, targets for ensuring we were dealing with illegal immigrants.“I think if you ask any member of the public they will say that they do want government making sure that people who are here illegally are removed.”Asked whether Ms May wanted targets to continue at the Home Office later in the day, a Downing Street spokesman said it is up to the secretary of state to set “priorities”.It is not the first sign that Ms May’s Cabinet is challenging her long-established approach to immigration, with foreign secretary Boris Johnson recently reported to have called for an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have resided in the country for 10 years or more.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesSajid Javid outside the Home Office in Westminster after he was appointed as the new Home Secretary.

I believe – and most British people believe – that they have been treated appallingly.“And he will be judged not on the statements he makes this afternoon. He will be judged on what he does to put the situation right and get justice for the Windrush generation.”Windrush scandal: What you need to knowPolicies under the “hostile environment” banner that aimed to make it harder for illegal immigrants to lead a settled life in the UK were super-charged by the Immigration Act 2014, proposed by Ms May when she ran the Home Office.In particular they sought to prevent people getting jobs, renting a home, accessing medical care, opening a bank account or getting a driving licence.Fourth cabinet minister steps down in six monthsAmber Rudd’s resignation won’t take the heat off Theresa MayMay ‘didn’t know’ about deportation targets which brought down RuddAmber Rudd was brought down by her inexperience – not by Windrush Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary, Downing Street saysRudd had ‘ambition’ to increase deportations but it was not ‘target’In 2012 she said in an interview: “The aim is to create here in Britain a really hostile environment for illegal migration.”She returned to her favoured phrase as she put her plans into legislation and took it to the Commons, telling MPs in 2013 that her proposals were about “making the UK a more hostile place for illegal migrants”.But when people from the Windrush generation of immigrants to the UK, who arrived from the Caribbean between the late 1940s and early 1970s, found themselves targeted by immigration officials, critics blamed the “hostile environment” approach.Windrush victims who have every right to be in the country – some of whom have lived here for decades – were targeted and reported losing their jobs and homes for failing to have the right paperwork. There have also been stories of people being denied critical medical treatment and being targeted for deportation.European parliament Brexit spokesman Guy Verhofstadt: The Windrush scandal has raised anxiety for EU citizens living in the UKAs the furore grew, Ms Rudd offered an apology, with Ms May following suit soon after, but both have been adamant that the situation is isolated and not related to any incorrect broader approach to dealing with illegal immigration.Ms Rudd was summoned to the Commons Home Affairs Committee to answer questions on the scandal and ended up inadvertently misleading MPs over her knowledge of internal Home Office targets for the numbers of people who should be deported.After first denying they existed, she was forced to admit they were used, but claimed she was unaware of them – something a string of leaked documents contradicted, making her resignation on Sunday inevitable.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Are we getting the balance right?”But, he continued: “I would differentiate between language and policy.

With weaker than anticipated economic conditions and the pound falling again,” said Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, which sponsors the PMI survey.The report, compiled by IHS Markit, also showed that business confidence among manufacturers has fallen to its weakest level in five months, with firms citing concerns about Brexit and possible future trade barriers.The growth of new export business was at its lowest in 10 months and job creation the feeblest in 14 months.Manufacturing accounts for 10 per cent of UK GDP and the Office for National Statistics estimated last week that the sector slowed dramatically in the three months to March, expanding by just 0.2 per cent, after booming in the second half of 2017, helped by the weaker pound.The ONS estimated that the UK’s overall GDP growth slumped to 0.1 per cent in the quarter, raising concerns that the economy is now virtually stagnating.Sterling was down 0.58 per cent on the day against the dollar in the wake of the figures at $1.3688.“Markit’s manufacturing survey provides more evidence that the economy has fundamentally slowed this year, strengthening the case even more for the MPC to hold back from raising interest rates later this month,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.In a separate indication that consumer sentiment might also be weakening, the Bank of England on Tuesday reported a drop in the number of mortgage approvals for house purchase in March to 62,914.This was below the 64.544 average for the previous six months, although the snow in the month is likely to have played a role in depressing activity.There was also a sharp slowdown in the rate of credit card borrowing, which rose by just £100m in the month, versus the six month average rate of £600m. The annual rate of borrowing growth dipped to 8.8 per cent, from 9.5 per cent previously.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This enthusiasm for them wanting to make a deal ... We are going to hopefully make a deal,” he told reporters.Mr Trump added he would maintain pressure on the North not to “repeat the mistakes of past administrations”.Korea Summit: Kim Jong-un crosses border for historic meetingKorea Summit: Kim Jong-un crosses border for historic meetingNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in raise their hands after signing on a joint statement Kim Jong-un heads towards Moon Jae-in to shake his hand between the military demarcation line, at the Joint Security Area on the Demilitarized Zone in the border village of Panmunjom in PajuSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hold hands as they cross the military demarcation lineSouth Koreans react while watching a screen reporting the Inter Korean SummitSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un chat as they arrive at the Peace HouseNorth Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un was escorted by bodyguards from the North to the Military Demarcation Line that ides the two Koreas to meet with his South Korean counterpart at the truce village North Korean leader Kim Jong-un crosses the military demarcation line to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-inKim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in shake handsNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shake hands after Kim crossing the military demarcation lineSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the Joint Security AreaSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un speak with two South Korean children who presented Kim Jong-un with a bouquet of flowersMoon Jae-in Kim Jong-un pose for photographers at the Joint Security Area (JSA)North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signs the guest book as South Korean President Moon Jae-in looks onNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s entry in the guestbook.

Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use.”Mr Netanyahu describes Iran allegedly continued with its nuclear capabilities with the purpose of making atomic weapons (EPA)The White House said in a statement: “This information provides new and compelling details about Iran’s efforts to develop missile-deliverable nuclear weapons.“These facts are consistent with what the United States has long known: Iran had a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people.”An earlier statement by the White House stated made the extraordinary claim Iran “has” a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, before it was corrected due to what it said was a clerical error.Iran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it. France and Germany also confirmed they will continue to back the nuclear agreement. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is not letting parliament have it\u0026rsquos say. The truth is if we want parliament to have a truly meaningful vote we have to insist on it.\u0026ldquoThat is what this new clause is about.A total of 335 Lords backed the amendment while 244 voted against it.                \u0026lsquoMost DANGEROUS day for Brexit\u0026rsquo: Lords to block \u0026lsquono deal\u0027                Rees-Mogg\u0027s brilliant message to Peers attempting to thwart BrexitMrs May\u0027s spokesman has criticised the moveMrs May\u0026rsquos spokesman said prior to the vote: The withdrawal bill is about ensuring we leave the EU in a smooth and orderly manner.\u0026ldquoIt is not a mechanism for overturning the referendum.What this amendment would do is weaken the UK\u0027s hand in the Brexit negotiations by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything in regard to the negotiations, including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.The Government does not have a majority in the unelected Lords, and the amendment attracted support from cross-benchers and opposition MPs.Labour\u0027s Keir Starmer called the amendment one of the most important in the Brexit processMrs May\u0026rsquos difficulties are compounded by the fact that she has a wafer-thin majority in the Commons and relies on support from Unionist MPs in Northern Ireland.This means it would only take a small Tory rebellion to throw a ner in the works, especially as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has signalled his support for remaining in a customs union with the EU.The government has committed to giving parliament a vote on the final deal, but has framed this as a choice of whether to accept the terms it has negotiated with Brussels or reject them and leave without a deal.Brexit Secretary David Davis said prior to the vote: \u0026ldquoThe Government represents the country in international negotiations, not Parliament.The Tory frontbencher added: \u0026ldquoThere is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.Speaking specifically about the amendment, he said: \u0026ldquoAt best it undermines the government\u0026rsquos ability to reach a good deal with the EU.\u0026ldquoAt worst, it could reverse the British people\u0026rsquos decision and keep us in the EU.Brexit secretary said the Lords were undermining the government\u0026rsquos ability to reach a good dealLord Callanan, the Tory Brexit Minister in the House of Lords, added: This flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from Government to Parliament.It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the \u0026lsquono Brexit\u0026rsquo amendment.Hours later Lords approved a second amendment, tabled by Lord Monks,\u0026nbspwhich would require ministers to seek parliamentary approval for their phase two negotiating mandate, by 270 votes to 233.Tweeting about last night\u0027s \u0027No Deal\u0027 block, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote: Labour and Lib Dem peers vote to give themselves a veto on Brexit.

Heres what you need to know about it.Every year, Shab e Barat is observed on the night between the 14 and 15 of Shaban, the eighth month of the Islamic calendar.This year, the month began on April 18, which means the festival this year takes place from dusk on Tuesday, May 1 until dawn the following day.Last year, the festival was around 10 days earlier.Shab e Barat is also widely known as Baraa Night and Mid-Shaban, for obvious reasons, while in the Arab world its referred to as Laylat al-Baraat. The festival of Shab e Barat falls in the run up to Ramadan and is considered the night when God forgives sinners.Muslims believe that God writes destinies for the coming year, taking into account their past actions – so they ask his mercy for any transgressions.It is also common in many regions for worshippers to offer prayers to Allah for forgiveness from their deceased loved ones.In Bangladesh, many people will fast on the day after the Shab e Barat night and in South Asia individuals hand out food and aid to their neighbours and the poor.The date of Shab e Barat is also celebrated as the birthday of Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is commemorated by Twelver Shia Muslims as being the saviour of mankind. Since the event is known as a night of absolution, deliverance and salvation, quotes for Shab e Barat are related to messages around forgiveness.Ramadan in 2018 will begin in the evening of Tuesday, May 15, and will end in the evening of Thursday, June 14.The beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar.Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.The night of power or night of decree is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.It is thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last 10 days of Ramadan - the 21, 23, 25, 27 or 29th.Fasting is obligatory for adult Muslims, except those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, are elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating.The fast is from dawn to sunset, with a pre-dawn meal known as suhur and sunset meal called iftar.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you let your child be their own person then she probably wouldn’t make the same decisions I did.More poignant, however, is the revelation that Jade was sexually assaulted when she was 16 – at a time when she had never even kissed a boy.Understandably the traumatic experience had a profound effect on her.Anything that happens to someone at a young age when boys cross the line it is going to affect you, she says now.Afterwards I was having sex a fair amount and I thought that was all I was worth.Getting into the porn industry allowed me to mature, to grow into myself, she says.When I got into this, there were people telling me I was beautiful and it brought me out of my shell, it made me believe in myself more than I ever did before.It’s given me independence and self-esteem.On some level I’m the last person you would think works in the adult industry – but often it’s the girls you never would have expected having sex for a living, like the quiet ones you used to see sat in the library with a book.Jade wasn’t quite that girl, although she describes herself as a naïve teenager. She won’t discuss her family, although she describes her upbringing as perfect.By the age of 13 however, she was already watching porn online.Boys in the playground at school were using all these sexual terms. I didn’t have a clue what those words meant so I started looking things up on the internet, she says.It was curiosity really. We’re the generation that’s grown up with the internet, with online pornography, it’s more normalised for our age group.Initially a more traditional career path beckoned though: Jade was accepted on a fashion degree course in Manchester and embarked on student life in the city.But as her student loan started to run out she took an unorthodox route to topping up her funds.I tried everything I could to get a traditional job to get some extra cash but every job in retail I applied for there were to 200 applicants for, she insists.Then a guy I’d met online suggested I sell some pornographic pictures and videos.I already had some on my phone from previous boyfriends so it wasn’t a big leap.Suddenly I had £100 in my bank account every few weeks and I could go shopping and it made me happy.Then, aged 19, she received an email from a website asking if she’d like to make a pornographic film. I said yes, that I would absolutely love to, she says.The basic shoot involved a very simple boy meets girl scene. I had no idea what to expect but I wasn’t nervous, she insists.I knew nothing though - I turned up with just the clothes on my back. I remember them asking me where my underwear and outfit options were. But I enjoyed it.Quickly, it seems, Jade found that performing porn gave her a sense of self-worth that had been missing from her life: she describes her student days as lonely and depressed and says that her newfound porn career gave her confidence.Nonetheless, it’s clear she has gone through experiences which made her unhappy, some of which unfold in the documentary.In one scene, in which her male co-star is struggling to perform Jade can be seen having a panic attack as she worries about filming with him again.In another more shocking incident, she confides that she has been bleeding after suffering a tear in her vagina after a vigorous sex session – yet feels she has no choice but to have sex with the same man on camera again. It’s my job, she says to camera.Today she does not want to dwell on these incidents, saying they are in the past. It was the start of what would become, post graduation, a full-time porn career, travelling to shoots all over Europe – among them Prague, Budapest, Spain, Austria.For two years I didn’t see my bed for more than about three days in a row. she says. But I found it very fulfilling. It gave me independence in a way that getting coffees as an intern in the fashion industry could never do.And while the pay wasn’t huge – some shoots pay £500 a day, some much less, with an hourly rate of around £12 - it was enough for her, by the age of 21, to rent her own city centre flat.She was also able to fund a boob job, something she calls her 21st birthday present to myself.I didn’t do it for men, she insists. I wanted to balance my body out. I went from a small B to a DD. I wanted that perfect rounded shape.She insists that she’s never had a bad experience or felt vulnerable. When I first started out I did some things I’m not proud of - someone was a bit rough with me, she says.But it was because I was bottom of the ladder. Now in terms of what I do on set everything is agreed on before I arrive.If I think a guy is going too hard I will just tell him to stop and they always respect it.Like all sex workers, she has regular sexual health checks as 90 percent of sex takes place without protection. So far, she has emerged unscathed.Years later, she now says that it is her work in porn, not real relationships, that give her a sense of self-worth.In my professional life men treat me with nothing but admiration and respect. But I find in real life that’s not the case, she says.It’s one reason she has decided to remain single for the foreseeable future, describing herself as asexual.It’s just easier this way, she says. One ex-boyfriend was fine with it at first but then got jealous.It’s just easier to have either porn or a boyfriend, you can’t really have both at the same time.Her friends, meanwhile, are aware of what she does but are unfazed.They’ve known me a long time and they know I enjoy being outlandish. It wasn’t the biggest shock to them.Again this description seems at odds with the portrait of the naïve and lonely girl that Jade also likes to paint of her past self.Either way, today Jade likes to think of herself as an entrepreneur as well as a porn performer.She has given up travelling to shoots and instead works from her Manchester flat creating her own content, which she sells to subscribers.I work three days a week from my own home and while I’m not rich I’m not poor. For me it’s not about the money, she says. It’s about doing something I enjoy.Is there a sell-by date on what she does? Who knows?, she asks. I live each day by the day. What about regret in the future? After all, the 60-year-old Jade might feel differently about what she did as a young girl.Maybe but I don’t think so, she says. I like to think that I’ll enjoy seeing how hot I was.I am proud of what I do. I honestly think that discovering the porn industry made me the person I am today, and I couldn’t be more grateful.Jade features in Jade: Why I Chose Porn on BBC iPlayer and Things Not To Say To Someone Who Works In Porn on BBC Three’s YouTube channelOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She doesn’t have a monopoly on anger”.In a declaration that will sound alarm in Downing Street, Mr Javid was also swift to rubbish the ‘hostile environment’ mantra, a phrase used by Theresa May herself just last week.Instead, he would refer to policies to make it harder for illegal immigrants to prosper here as “compliant environment”, telling MPs: “I don’t like the phrase hostile. It’s not a phrase I’m going to use. It doesn’t represent the values of our country”.And hinting he is ready to make major changes to introduce a more liberal immigration policy, Mr Javid added: “It’s not just about a personnel change. It’s about action, and that’s why she’ll be seeing from my department”.But he said he is yet to decide on whether to continue with deportation targets, the controversial issue that Ms Rudd had to resign over after inadvertently misleading the Commons when she said last week they didn’t exist.Mr Javid immediately won the praise of his predecessor Ms Rudd, who tweeted: \u0026#8220Outstanding debut by fantastic Sajid Javid in House of Commons today.\u0026#8221\u0026mdash Amber Rudd MP (@AmberRuddHR) April 30, 2018But he risked angering his ageing mother by admitting he was yet to call her, but pledged: “I will do later”.Mr Javid’s elevation now makes him the boss of his younger brother Bas, who is a Chief Superintendent with West Midlands Police.Mr Javid has already ran for the Tory leadership once, on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb against Theresa May in 2016. But they were eliminated in the first round of voting.Ms Rudd’s Cabinet exit has slashed the number of women around Theresa May’s top table down to just 22% in a blow for one of her own personal goals.Just five out of the Cabinet\u0026#8217s 23 full members are now women, after the PM failed to replace the outgoing Home Secretary with another woman.A further four female ministers are allowed to attend Cabinet.Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt took over Rudd’s Women and Equalities brief yesterday in addition to her aid responsibilities. Despite it being just day one on the job, Mr Javid was bombarded with calls from many quarters to reform the government’s creaking immigration policy.He also inherits a huge in tray, from also drawing up tough new terrorism laws to conquering rising gun and knife crime, and devising a new post-Brexit immigration system for EU citizens. Yesterday MEPs gave the new Home Secretary one of his first headaches in office as they voiced concerns over the registration process for EU citizens.In a letter to Mr Javid, the EU parliament’s Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt laid out a series of demands for the settled status scheme.MEPs also want applications to be cleared within 48 hours, with those who don’t receive a response within that time presumed to have been successful.Finally, in a sign of how low trust in the Home Office has sunk, the Parliament demanded to see evidence of how it will finance the scheme.The letter follows a presentation by Home Office officials in Brussels last week at which it emerged their flagship registration app doesn’t work properly on iPhones.Through hard graft and natural wit, he has gone from growing up on Britain’s most crime ridden street to the Home Office’s HQ on Marsham Street.On Bristol’s notorious Stapleton Road, he shared a cramped two bedroom flat with his parents and FOUR brothers until the age of 12.It was opposite a brothel, and a prostitute used to stand outside.“I didn’t know what a prostitute was at the time,” Sajid told me during the 2015 general election campaign. “For me, it was home”.Both parents were first generation Brits, immigrating from the Punjab in Pakistan – his father with just £1 in his pocket when he arrived.Dad Abdul eventually escaped the Rochdale cotton mill to realise his ambition of becoming a bus driver, before achieving his next one of owning his own clothes shop with a family move down south to Bristol.A childhood highlight for Sajid came twice a year when, as a special treat, the boys’ father would rent a VHS player for a weekend and leave them to binge on all the latest movies, until it went back to the shop on Monday.From being able to speak only Punjabi when he first went to nursery aged three, Sajid won a place at Exeter University.From there, he went into the City and made millions, becoming the youngest ever vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25.All his success he attributes to his mum and dad.The MP for Bromsgrove still lives by his father’s favourite mantra.“You get back what you put in, my dad would often say,” he also told me.It was the Falklands War two years on that “awoke my patriotism”, he said.“I wouldn’t miss a single night of the TV news and I bought all the newspapers, I had to follow every turn.”Sajid’s proud father saw his son elected to Parliament in 2010, but died of cancer a year later, and didn’t witness his elevation to the government as a junior Treasury minister in 2012, having caught the keen eye of then Chancellor George Osborne.He entered the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2014, going on to serve as Business Secretary in 2015, and Housing Secretary in 2016.A father of three himself now, the 48-year-old appears far from finished yet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If this means London swings to Labour, then it’s also likely to mean much of the rest of England will swing to Conservative.”He added: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even those they have lost more seats in London.”The Strathcylde University Professor – Britain’s most famous so-called psephologist – received a knighthood in the Queen’s 2018 New Year’s honours list.He has accurately predicted the last four general elections, including last June’s surprise results where he correctly said the Conservatives would lose their majority.The forecast came as separate research claimed voters were “anxious” about the state of the country – led by fury over the housing crisis.Deborah Mattinson at Britain Thinks added that young 18-30 voters were “more gloomy than older voters” and felt a “strong sense of injustice”.She said: “Seven out of ten no longer think it pays to work hard.”Some 4,410 seats are being contested on Thursday across 150 councils. Just over 40 per cent are in London.Sir John said: “Because London accounts for 42 per cent of seats, there is a risk that the headline tally of seats won or lost will be misleading.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is taking Lexlaw to a tribunal alleging constructive dismissal, but is said to be “entirely sanguine” about airing details of his kinky activities.Sources close to Mr Jones insist the spanking was consensual and the couple did not have sex.But he is said to be keen to protect the “very junior employee” involved in a tryst that sent rumbles through London’s stuffy Inns of Court.Mr Jones told legal blog RollOnFriday that he was suspended last June just a day after he rejected a request from Lexlaw’s managing director to reconsider his resignation amid a salary dispute.The lawyer said the spanking session had happened long before he quit and claimed it was only raised so Lexlaw would not have to pay him for his notice period.Mr Jones studied at Cambridge from 1996 to 2000, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a special prize in astrophysics before studying law. He joined Lexlaw in October 2012 and specialised in corporate finance, before leaving last year to become a freelance barrister.On the row, Mr Jones said: “I had a consensual BDSM relationship with another employee, which included one brief incident in private on work premises several months before the disciplinary proceedings.“I was appalled to find out that my employer was monitoring my personal communications over a period of at least several months.”He claims the disciplinary action was in “retaliation” for him handing in his notice and “not a result of the much earlier incident”.A spokesman for Lexlaw confirmed “inappropriate workplace activities” had taken place last year involving a senior barrister.They declined to comment further other than to say: “The activities that took place are as unacceptable in our workplace as they would no doubt be in any workplace.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It stated: “This is very effective. Now you can go and steal as much as you can.”Another video told how to use magnets to beat tags.In February a shoplifter boasted he went on a stealing spree after watching a video tutorial on YouTube.Joseph Burwood, 22, targeted four stores at Clarks Village in Street, Somerset. He told JPs he “wanted to give it a go”.Burwood got a 12-month conditional discharge.Shoplifting costs the UK economy more than £6billion a year.

But then I couldn’t have imagined the abuse the elephants suffer.“Now I know, and I think everyone else needs to see this and know too.”Arthur is one of 50 elephants kept in pain and terror at an “elephant temple” in Guruvayur, in Kerala, South India.It is a popular destination for thousands of the more than 850,000 Brits who visit India each year.Evanna, who is also an avid animal rights campaigner, continued: “I have been so shocked. We saw one elephant chained up — it couldn’t move at all.“It had a stick resting on its head so if it moved the stick would fall. If it did the trainer would give it a beating.“I asked the man standing there how long the elephant might have been there, and he told me probably his whole life. That is unfathomable.”India’s elephants are snatched from their mothers in the wild when they are babies and taken to secret “training camps”. Here they are beaten, starved and tortured into complete submission in a process called “pajan”.The first step is for the beasts to be forced into a kraal or “crushing cage”.This is a wooden structure designed to keep the elephant so tightly caged it cannot move — not even to turn around, nod its head or sit down.Trainers then starve the animal and keep it awake for days on end.Exhausted and on the brink of death, the elephants are then beaten with wooden weapons, specially designed to inflict as much pain as possible.This happens every day for at least six months, but can go on for years.When finally their spirit is so broken that they let their trainers ride them, they are deemed safe enough to be rented out or sold to tourist attractions and temples across India.Nearly half of the elephants die from this abuse, and of those who survive to be sold, another ten per cent die within a year due to stress. But their suffering is a tourism goldmine.Elephants can be rented out for rides, festivals or to temples for anything from £34 to £1,600 a day — in a country where the average labourer only makes £10 a day.While much of the most violent training takes place out of sight of tourists, the brutal reality of elephants’ lives is far from hidden.When we arrive at Kerala’s Kochi airport a giant elephant statue welcomes us, complete with chains around its feet.Within half an hour of being on the road we are overtaken on a motorway by a rusty truck carrying an elephant tied down by chains, wires and rope. Seconds later another passes.They are being transported from camps across the country to one of India’s famous elephant festivals, Thrissur Pooram, in Thrissur, Kerala.We are on our way to the same event, where we find more than 90 elephants have been shipped in. They are dressed up and forced to stand in front of huge crowds while cannons fire and drums are banged for hours.With the help of our guide we gain access to a backstage holding pen for the animals, out of sight of visitors.In this dark, corrugated-iron structure the animals are heavily chained, unable to move or access water. Each has at least one trainer guarding it with sticks, and every animal looks terrified.Many have gaping wounds on their feet and backs — not a problem for the trainers who simply paint the wounds grey to cover up the injuries from the tourists.In order to discover more about what these beasts have been through, Evanna and I travel two hours north into deep forest to the village of Kodanad, where our guide tells us there is a training camp. After some careful negotiations with guards we manage to enter, posing as tourists who “just want to see the elephants”. Inside we see the terrible, stark reality of their lives.Chained to tree stumps, they are in appalling condition.Autoor is 16 years old and we find her swaying her head from side to side, over and over again — a sign of huge distress.It is impossible not to want to comfort her, but before we get too close a trainer approaches and whacks her with a stick, she immediately stops swaying, instead standing completely still.We quickly move on until we find a clearing in the forest. It is here we find the saddest of sights — a lone elephant locked in a crushing cage.The wooden cell stands so tall at first it is almost impossible to make out the elephant stuck inside.Then the trainers arrive and begin hitting and stabbing the elephant through the cage with large sticks.It is too much to bear and, with our guide getting increasingly anxious about our pictures being discovered, we quickly leave.I ask our guide, is this how all elephants are trained, or are some tamed more humanely?His response is chilling: “This is every single tourist elephant’s fate. The only reason they obey is with fear. They have been broken.”Duncan McNair, founder of charity Save The Asian Elephants (STAE), who was on the undercover trip to India, is campaigning for a law banning UK holiday firms and tour companies advertising trips for these sorts of encounters with animals.He says: “Elephants are some of the most intelligent, emotional creatures in the world and the abuse they suffer is unimaginable.“Those horrors ensure the rest of their life is lived in fear.“I’m confident that if any tourist ever saw this, or even a small aspect of it, they would be appalled.”With tears in her eyes, Evanna said: “When people who have ridden elephants in the past or visited these places see this article, I don’t want them to feel guilty — they were misled by the irresponsible tourist industry.“What we need to do is to put that guilt into action and not visit these places in future.“I’d read a lot about the abuse elephants suffer but seeing it up close has given me the ability to speak from my heart and tell others that we can make a change by not spending our money and posting these tourist images.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.“If one chooses to kill oneself, then that should be fair enough.

That included:Ministers only lost one vote on the EU withdrawal Bill in the Commons - when 11 Tory rebels voted in favour of a change which would only allow ministers to use powerful statutory instruments to change law if Parliament voted in favour of the withdrawal deal first.Many of these amendments are tricky for the Government because it means handing over more powers to MPs and Lords to dictate our EU exit and what it will look like.Last nights changes - if they are accepted by MPs - would give MPs the power to stop the UK from leaving without a deal, and could keep us in altogether.It would mean that Parliament has the power to decide what happens if MPs turn down the final arrangement that David Davis and Michel Barnier strike.Critics say this is ignoring the will of the 17 million Brits who voted for Brexit.Ministers said it could even risk weakening the UKs hand in negotiations - because the EU know that they will have to get MPs to pass it at the end of the day. Lords have another day to debate amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill tomorrow, on May 2.Then it will return to the Commons for MPs to consider the changes.But the Government are sure to try and overturn them, and it could result in a game of ping pong between the two Houses as t hey fight over the wording.When it has been agreed by both the Commons and the Lords, its ready for Royal Assent and will officially become law when we quit the EU.But if they dont agree on it, the Bill could fail totally.In that case, the Commons could use an Act of Parliament to pass the Bill without the consent of the Lords.Only seven have become law under this procedure - and a further three were set to do so but the Lords eventually caved in.Ministers could also try invoke the Salisbury Convention - which ensures that Government Bills can get through the Lords when they have no majority there - because it was a promise mentioned in an election manifesto. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ms Judd held firm, saying, No, when I win. And then she fled the scene.Judd said the first time she became aware of why Sir Peter failed to cast her was when he spoke about the decision last year as dozens of women publicly accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.Weinstein, 66, is being investigated by police in London, New York and Los Angeles. He has apologised for his past behaviour but denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.A spokeswoman for Weinstein refuted the claims of Judd and Sir Peter and said the shamed producer would launch a vigorous defence.The most basic investigation of the facts will reveal that Mr Weinstein neither defamed Ms Judd nor ever interfered with Ms Judds career, and instead not only championed her work but also repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies over the next decade, she said.After the lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles on Monday, Judd said she would donate any damages won to the Times Up initiative and its legal defence fund to help women fight sexual harassment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My skin peels off and, at times, there is bleeding.“All I can do is watch children my age play and enjoy their life.”Vedika, from Indore in India, spends her time alone studying, painting and watching TV as she doesn’t have any friends.Her family have taken her to several doctors but none have been able to provide her with a cure.She has to cover herself in moisturiser several times a day to stop her skin from cracking, flaking and bleeding.Vedika’s older sister Sunidhi, 20, also suffers from the condition and is so self-conscious about her looks she doesn’t go outside.Their aunts also suffer from the genetic condition.“My elder daughter who also has the same skin disorder keeps herself confined in her room,” said mum Madhuri Gupta.“She is now a grown woman conscious about her looks and appearance. Hence, she avoids socialising, interacting with people or even coming in front of the camera.”Desperate for a cure the sisters turned to alternative treatments, which only made their skin worse.Then they heard about the plight of Shalini Yadav, an Indian teenager whose lamellar ichthyosis was cured by treatment in Spain.They are now crowdfunding for the same medication, which doctors say will be available in India.“All I want is that my daughters dont suffer the same way like me in the future, giving birth to babies with similar disorders, there should be a treatment,” Madhuri said.“At home, I keep my daughters in comfort, but outside the struggle that they face, I cannot do anything about it.”Vedika hopes the new treatment will change her life.“Everyone has treated me equally, but yes when I speak to some stranger then I feel a little uncomfortable,” she said.“If I get help like Shalini got, I can also lead a life of dignity.“If there is any treatment that helps improve my skin condition by 50 per cent, it will give my confidence a boost.”You can donate to their cause at their fundraising page here.The skin cells are produced at a normal rate, but they do not separate normally at the surface of the outermost layer of skin and are not shed as quickly as they should be.The result of this retention is the formation of scales.Symptoms:Signs of the condition will be present at birth.Babies are often covered with a clean membrane and have dark red, tight skin.Often the eyelids and lips are forced open by the tightness.Babies also can experience problems with temperature regulation, water loss and secondary infections.People with lamellar ichthyosis often have trouble closing their eyes completely because of the tightness of the skin around the eyes and eyelids.In some cases, the skin around the eyes pulls so tightly it causes they eyelids to turn outward exposing the inner red lid and causing continuous irritation.The dry skin builds up so much that suffers shed skin on a daily basis.Treatment:Lamellar ichthyosis is treated topically with skin barrier repair formulas containing ceramides or cholesterol, moisturizers with petrolatum or lanolin.Severe lamellar ichthyosis can be treated systemically with oral synthetic retinoids.Retinoids are only used in severe cases of lamellar ichthyosis due to their known bone toxicity and other complications.There is no known cure, but several clinical studies are active around the world."}]
