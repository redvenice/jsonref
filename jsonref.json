She talks about class, race and healthcareKiley Reid’s debut novel Such a Fun Age isn’t out yet, but early readers have already confused the author with her main character and she would like to make one thing clear: “Emira’s not me.”Emira is a 25-year-old typist and babysitter who looks after Alix’s two-year-old daughter, Briar. Set in Philadelphia, the story begins when Alix calls Emira at 11pm and asks her to look after Briar while Alix deals with an emergency. Emira takes Briar to an upmarket food shop where the toddler likes to look at the displays of nuts, but the young black woman looking after a white child is challenged by a security guard, unleashing a reckoning with issues of class, money and race that unlocks a guilty secret from Alix’s past.Born in Los Angeles in 1984, Reid was raised in Tucson, Arizona, before moving to New York City to study acting at Marymount Manhattan College, followed by creative writing at the University of Arkansas and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Reid says she finds it funny when readers think they can hear her in Emira, explaining that if anything she has “more of a background like Alix”. Growing up in a fairly wealthy family with parents who valued education, she’s conscious of her “very privileged place”, but when she started at college, she made her living from childcare, doing children’s birthday parties at an art studio and – just like Emira – working as a nanny: “That was my income for about six years.”The people Reid nannied for, like Alix, were rich – “all of them … If you ask them, they probably wouldn’t say that, but if you own a home in New York and can afford to hire a nanny, then you either have extreme income, or extreme wealth – or both.”On both sides of this ide, working women are making choices about childcare in a world designed by men, she continues. “There’s no way it’s going to work unless someone is at home, taking care of the child.” There’s also an expectation that women will be cut out for it. “Childcare is not easy and Emira kills it – she’s good at it. Alix is much more interested in why Emira doesn’t have an Instagram or who she’s dating, rather than her being an excellent caretaker.”When Alix comes back from a trip to New York City, she realises how much she has missed both her “chatty and nervous daughter”, Reid writes, “and the quiet, thoughtful person she paid to love her”. And that’s the essence of the transaction: to give love for money. Reid says she’s fascinated by emotional labour, citing Harry Harlow’s experiments in the 1950s and 60s with rhesus monkeys, which showed that baby monkeys preferred the comfort of a substitute mother made of terry cloth instead of wire, even if the wire mother dispensed milk. With the minimum wage in New York City set at $15 (£11.20) an hour, “when you are looking for someone to take care of your child,” Reid continues, “you’re asking for love, but you’re only paying $16 an hour.”Nannies are not only denied the money and status their weighty responsibilities demand, they’re also working within the tiniest margins of error. “I was a receptionist,” Reid says. “If I messed up a phone call it was: ‘OK, I’d do better next time.’ But if you mess up with a child, if you hurt someone’s child, that will stay with you for the rest of your life. You’re going to lose your job – the parent network is very small, they’ll make sure you don’t babysit for anyone else’s child – and it’s going to affect your performance because you’re nervous. Parents make mistakes all the time, but they often don’t allow the same forgiveness to their caretakers.”For many young women working as part-time carers in the US, this precariousness is all the more serious because they have no health insurance. After a catastrophic Thanksgiving dinner with Alix’s friends and family, Emira tells her boyfriend that she knows she has to quit, but she can’t do it yet: “I turn 26 next week … I’m gonna be kicked off my parents’ health insurance.”It’s a dilemma Reid knows only too well. She recalls feeling nervous as she cut cakes at children’s birthday parties. “The issue of health insurance became real to me because I knew if I cut myself it was going to alter the course of my life, and I’d have to pay thousands of dollars.”Emira’s struggle to find a secure job may be at the heart of the novel, but while Reid says she doesn’t like “issues books … at the same time, I’m not interested in reading or writing anything that doesn’t comment on the world we live in”.Donald Trump was only an unlikely candidate for president when she began writing Such a Fun Age in 2016, but race has always been a isive issue in the US, and it shapes the world of the novel right from the opening scenes. The confrontation that opens the story is framed by the racial implications of walking into a smart shop if you are a black person, and Reid weaves these questions into the heart of the novel. As Emira protests that she’s Briar’s nanny, a customer in a college T-shirt starts filming the dispute, and it is the relationship Emira falls into with that customer, Kelley – a monied, white professional man – that reveals the unacknowledged prejudice at the centre of Alix’s carefully constructed life.It’s not that Alix is a bad person, Reid explains. “Her whole personality is more of a symptom of a bigger systemic problem, rather than just her being inherently bad.” Reid is fascinated by the way “a lot of Americans will often freeze over these topics and say: ‘Well we’re all human, we all have the same experience,’ when we don’t. I wanted to create characters who were dying to help, but kind of going through mental gymnastics to ignore the broken systems that put people where they are to begin with.”The novel suggests it is hard for Emira’s relationship with Kelley to thrive, the young black woman asking herself if her white boyfriend could ever really “take our son to get his hair done? Who’s gonna teach him that it doesn’t matter what his friends do, that he can’t stand too close to white women when he’s on the train or in an elevator? That he should slowly and noticeably put his keys on the roof as soon as he gets pulled over?” Questions that are all the more urgent because of Reid’s own situation. “I mean, I’m married to a white man.”Most black women in a relationship with a white man, she says, ask themselves: “Could this person really take this on with me? My husband and I have had many conversations, but I’ve also learned a lot from him. He says to me sometimes: ‘You should be angrier, be louder about the situation.’”She can’t stand the current fashion among white women in the US to deplore the number of white men in public life. “It’s never bothered you until right now. Before it was fine. I think it’s incredibly lazy and I think it takes the pressure off white men to step up and be something in their white skin.” Her husband has taught her “so much about the human experience and equality”, she says.Since black women die earlier than any other demographic in the US and make less money, it’s natural for them to come into an interracial relationship thinking they have less power, she says. “Some black women say: ‘I don’t want to explain anything, I’m not going to do this any more.’ I’m not one of them, but I completely understand that perspective.”Of her characters, she adds, “I think Kelley and Emira quite like each other, I think what’s holding them back from being together are class issues, rather than race.“Any conversation about race without bringing up class is a bit of a moot point,” Reid says. “Whenever people want to talk about race in the States, there’s a lot of push to even the playing field and find a common ground. In a lot of cases it’s very easy to do that with race, because when you’re a white person in power you’re often around one or two black people who are in power as well. So … I don’t know … ” She trails off. “It’s complicated.”With issues of class, money and race at the front and centre of her novel, Reid says she feels lucky her editors didn’t push back. But publishers who want to reflect these complicated experiences have still got a long way to go.“I was not searched for at all,” she says. “If you want to be a writer, you have to have support and capital to get yourself there. If you do not have that, it’s not going to be as easy, and in the States the people who don’t have that are mostly black people.” And that’s a problem for the voices we get to hear. It’s not that any subject is off limits, Reid thinks, but it’s just harder for an author to write outside their own experience. “You, as a writer, can write from any perspective, but you need to do it right. And if you don’t – writing is such a brave thing, it’s so hard – if you don’t do it right, I’ll be the one that comes for you.” She laughs. “You’re going to fail often – have people read it, and if you don’t have black people around you to read it, then maybe you’ve got to figure out why that might have happened.”At the moment she’s working on a screenplay for the adaptation of Such a Fun Age. When the producer Lena Waithe – best known for Master of None – bought the film and television rights, Reid “didn’t just want to let it go”. “I wanted to be a part of the process, for sure,” she says. “Lena Waithe is someone who wants to create opportunities for people of colour – she really puts her money where her mouth is when it comes to bringing on new voices.”Reid is also working on a second novel, although it is still so fresh she is reluctant to give clues about what it will contain. But readers can be sure she won’t be ducking any of the issues that animate her firecracker debut. After all, as Reid says: “No writing is not political.”• Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid is published by Bloomsbury on 7 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c664b6930183e50dcc7a4ad06276b39335c0879/0_150_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e88b9c18d8a07a201b6a810955599c48","title":"thomas cook departure opportunities for rivals tui easyjet","story":"The aftershocks of the Thomas Cook liquidation are still being felt some three months after its seismic collapse, if only because the 178-year-old company practically invented modern tourism.Train trips organised for temperance campaigners by the company’s namesake founder in the 19th century were the precursor to the package holiday that shaped the leisure time of the 20th. Such rich history is one reason why the firm’s spectacular implosion met with such genuine sadness, even from competitors. But the reality of business leaves little room for sentiment, and mourning soon gave way to opportunism.German arch-rival Tui pounced swiftly, adding 2 million extra seats on flights for summer 2020 and, at short notice, 580,000 for short- and long-haul journeys over this winter.Looking even further ahead, to 2021, it boasts that customers will be able to choose from hundreds of hotels, “including Thomas Cook favourites recently added”. Shares in Tui had begun climbing in the summer even as Thomas Cook was fighting for its survival, as traders bet that it would move into the space likely to be vacated by its rival.No-frills carriers have also benefited from the demise of Thomas Cook’s airline, stepping in to help sunseekers make it to holidays from the Med to Miami, and boosting revenues in the process.Jet2 and easyJet both grabbed some of the group’s coveted landing slots from the Official Receiver, the government employee trying to recoup funds from the liquidation.Jet2 snapped up berths at Manchester, Birmingham and Stansted for an undisclosed amount. EasyJet shelled out £36m for slots at Gatwick and Bristol, adding 70,000 seats a year to destinations in Turkey and Tunisia.In the first few weeks after Thomas Cook Airlines’ disappearance, flight prices jumped as rivals capitalised on demand for seats now in short supply.But according to price comparison site Skyscanner, the effect has been only temporary. “We typically see prices increase for key routes when an airline ceases trading, before reverting back again soon after,” said the website’s Sam Ayles.“Happily, there’s good news for travellers, as this seems to be the case on former Thomas Cook routes,” she added, pointing to prices for destinations such as Alicante, Orlando and Palma, which rose sharply before returning to normal.But another comparison site, Jack’s Flight Club, believes prices have stayed stubbornly high in those areas where Thomas Cook’s absence has weakened competition on a longer-term basis.“Destinations previously covered by Thomas Cook, often at very attractive prices, are now in some cases significantly more expensive to reach,” said co-founder Jack Sheldon. “For example, Thomas Cook ran a number of year-round direct routes to destinations in Cuba, such as Cayo Coco, Holguin and Varadero, often with fares from £290-£400 return – even during the winter high season. Looking at these destinations today, you’d be hard pressed to find anything under £500 or even £600.”He reserved special mention for Manchester airport, where he said competitors such as Virgin Atlantic have had free rein to keep prices higher than they would otherwise have been. Sheldon said: “As predicted, Thomas Cook’s collapse primarily hurts customers flying from Manchester, where they provided much-needed competition to a fairly large variety of destinations, often being the sole carrier flying direct to certain destinations.”But what of Hays Travel, the private travel agency from Sunderland that took on Thomas Cook’s network of 553 high street outlets in October?The prevailing wisdom in some corners was that the bricks-and-mortar model was an anachronism and that this was at the heart of Thomas Cook’s failure.Not so, said John and Irene Hays, the shrewd husband-and-wife team who run Hays Travel.“All of the behaviour that we initially saw in terms of the public being supportive of us opening the shops has continued,” said Irene. “Bearing in mind the time of year and that not all shops have been fully staffed, we have had a very good November and early December.”The Hayses have always insisted that package holidays have a bright future. They believe that despite the fixed costs of physical premises, the shops will be profitable when unburdened of the millstone of Thomas Cook’s massive debts.“We continue to be really optimistic,” said John.He admits that some of the shops were unlikely to reopen, some because they are in such poor condition, some because of legal wrangles and others through lack of staff. But of the 553 that the company bought, he expects the chain to eventually number “more than 450, closer to 500”.It’s an outcome that would ensure that, though Thomas Cook has departed, its package holiday soul lives on.When Thomas Cook collapsed three months ago, reactions in the Canary Islands varied from the bleak to the apocalyptic.One local hotel worker described the news as “a bit of a bombshell” while a Tenerife MP said the company’s demise had triggered “one of the biggest economic crises that the Canaries have faced”.Fortunately, however, things have panned out rather better than expected. The busy winter season has taken only a relatively small hit, mainly thanks to the efforts of rival tour operators and the odd European government.Oliver said the caretaker socialist government of prime minister Pedro Sánchez had acted in “record time to put in place an emergency plan to minimise the effects of the collapse”.The government has approved €800m (£680m) of financial assistance to help the sector weather the storm as well as handing out subsidies of €15m to the Canaries and €8m to the Balearics.Jorge Marichal, president of the Spanish hoteliers’ confederation (Cehat), said the acting Spanish government had done what it could given the political circumstances.Marichal said the German government’s €380m loan to support the Thomas Cook subsidiary Condor had been very important, as had the purchase of the company’s Nordic business by a trio of buyers at the end of October.“Both of those things really helped people breathe a sigh of relief – especially in the Canaries where people were worried that they’d have to do without the important northern European customers this winter season,” he added.“We’ve also had Ryanair closing bases and the whole Brexit issue,” he said. “Still, given how bad things could have been, the storm hasn’t been nearly as bad as had been feared. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have to work hard to get ready for next summer.”Sam Jones"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057e9b8b0fa74cba07afc5252bb2183973e67015/0_1510_2912_1747/master/2912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853bb010f72fb12393cb438060ec0e8c","title":"use it or lose it consumer experts tell gift card holders","story":"Tens of thousand of recipients fall foul of short expiry dates and retailers’ collapsesConsumer experts have told those lucky enough to have received a gift card at Christmas to make sure they spend it while the retailer is still in a position to honour it.Stores pocket about £360m each year from cards that get lost down the backs of sofas or otherwise expire before being used. The growth comes despite the number of high-profile stores that have collapsed in recent years, leaving thousands of gift card holders out of pocket.When Thomas Cook collapsed in September, one Milton Keynes family who had saved £800 on the travel firm’s gift card for a trip to Disneyland found they had lost the lot.About 25,000 House of Fraser customers were unable to spend their gift cards when the department store chain collapsed late in 2018. Gift card holders at Toys R Us, HMV, Maplin, BHS, Jessops and American Apparel have also similarly lost out.Guy Anker, the deputy editor of MoneySavingExpert, said: “When it comes to Christmas presents, a lot of people prefer to buy a gift card than give cash. But cash is often a far better option as it’s safer, more flexible and doesn’t have a hidden expiry date.“The main issue with gift cards is that if the shop goes bust, gift cards may quickly become worthless. If you really want to give a gift card there’ll be less risk if it’s from a store in good financial shape or is a card you can use at multiple stores. And if you do get gift cards this Christmas, remember to check when they expire and try to spend them as quickly as possible.”Cards expiring before the owner can use them has become a common consumer complaint. Retailers such as Amazon offer 10-year expiry dates but Ticketmaster offers 12 months. WH Smith card holders have 24 months to spend their balance before they lose it.“The continued growth of gift cards is hardly a surprise, not least as they give shoppers the chance to buy a gift they’ll treasure, while helping to prevent unwanted presents from ending up as landfill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3f952fc23e6219aa9793cc73e694e2e1e4fbd03/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474c0e8b52d1a06e0790bcfce55f558a","title":"union survived decade labour scotland snp","story":"In 2010, Labour’s hold on Scotland looked unshakeable. Ten years on, the SNP dominates and the union is in crisisDespite the rise of nationalism, Scottish politics in 2010 could still resemble old and familiar patterns. I remember the response that Labour canvassers got in a council estate on the outskirts of Coatbridge, a constituency that the sitting MP, a 69-year-old local man, Tom Clarke, had every expectation of winning for the eighth time.Such a complete rout for Labour in 2019 – and such a calamity for unionism – had not been easy to foresee. If anything, the portents in the 2010 election had pointed slightly in the other direction. Gordon Brown, whatever his troubles south of the border, was a name that met a mainly agreeable response on the doorstep. Labour had been 13 years in power, but its vote in Scotland actually went up by 2.5 percentage points. The SNP had managed only six seats – the same as five years earlier – but the arrival of the Cameron-Clegg coalition in Westminster and the start of austerity meant that an old, pre-devolutionary argument could be resurrected: Scotland had a government – and government policies – that it hadn’t voted for. In 2011, the SNP won an outright majority at Holyrood for the first time with a manifesto that, among other things, recommitted the party to a referendum on independence.The riots in London (and in a few other English cities, on a smaller scale) erupted later the same summer.Alex Salmond, then Scotland’s first minister, complained about the needless damage to the tourist industry caused by broadcasters describing the disturbances as “UK riots” when they were confined entirely to England. His unionist critics accused him, quite rightly, of “gloating” and cheap point-scoring, but other people in Scotland had a different reaction. His remarks confirmed a suspicion that England was becoming problematic in an entirely new way: not as the cause of nationalist anger and grievance but as a troubled society to feel sorry for and be separated from.This pitying, uncomprehending view of England spread quickly throughout the world after the EU referendum result in 2016, not least in England itself. But it was on a Hebridean island in 2011 that I first noticed that the traditional nationalist position on the union – that it was oppressive – had been changed to the subtler question of what good it did. Economics and public finance apart – an admittedly large exclusion – the question became harder and harder to answer after 2016. It was, my late Scottish colleague Deborah Orr observed, “like being tied to a man wearing a suicide vest”.This was true, but it ignored the uncomfortable fact that the duke and Alexander were now on the same, unionist side and that the SNP, particularly its deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, now framed independence as the most pragmatic route to social justice rather than the best means of preserving and encouraging national identity. No longer could it be labelled a party of “Tartan Tories”. Labour support among the urban underprivileged, particularly in the party’s old strongholds in the western Lowlands, such as Coatbridge, began to collapse.That the unionists won the referendum was little thanks to places such as these, each with their equivalents, just as brimming with disenchantment, in the English Midlands, south Wales and the English north. David Cameron’s too-quick reaction to victory, promising counterbalancing English reforms to those the unionist side had promised Scotland, had its consequences in the SNP’s near total victory – 56 seats out of 59 – in the general election of 2015. But how was deindustrialised England to find its cure or get its revenge? The answer came soon enough, in the form of Brexit and Nigel Farage. In 2014, Alexander had rooted the appeal of both Salmond and Farage in their easy blame of “the other” – Brussels in Farage’s case, and Londonausteritythe ToriesWestminster (“choose your descriptor,” said Alexander) in Salmond’s.Another similarity, not easily predicted, was how the fantastical version of English history embraced by English nationalism would equal and then overtake the Caledonian delusions that the SNP was beginning to shed. It had lain dormant inside the fog of British history since Empire Day was last celebrated, but now sprang angrily to life. There had been claymores in the north there would be Spitfires in the south.The feeling of Britishness began to wither in many of us during this decade, though unionism, its constitutional cousin, should never be written off. The obstacles to Scotland’s success as an independent state, inside the EU but outside the customs border of what remains of the UK, are forbidding, and nationalists tend towards the non-arguments of Brexiteers when confronted with them (“Oh, it’ll work somehow, you’ll see”). The principal friend of the union is exhaustion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60443389484f940919064274c8a1f0c26d9d8738/0_278_4161_2497/master/4161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c8db685586ec1a15bc07b05046269f9","title":"gavin and stacey what occurrin weve all gone back to barry island","story":"Oh!

I’m Pamela and I’m proud.Early figures showed that half of all viewers tuned in, almost 12 million people, making it the biggest festive hit in a decade. When, on the same day, the Queen addressed roughly half that audience with a plea to overcome “long-held differences and deep-seated isions to bring harmony and understanding”, she could not have imagined what would unite the nation was collectively waiting to hear Nessa say: “What’s occurrin’?” for the first time since 2008.For all of their broad brushstrokes, such as the harried Christmas dinner and the grim soppiness of the two leads, Corden and Jones have a real knack for knowing exactly when to leave it. When Bryn started to talk about the fishing trip, we covered our ears and willed him not to explain. Of course he didn’t. But it was that ending that had everyone talking. Whether it was left inconclusive for the show to return again, or purely to keep us guessing, that delightfully open and cheering final scene refused to be wrapped up in a neat bow.It was left wonderfully messy. And that was tidy.Last week, Kylie Minogue starred in the latest ad from Tourism Australia, presiding over the #Matesong, a glossy, tongue-in-cheek musical celebration of the country’s greatest hits. As someone who loves musicals so much that I would watch a musical adaptation of my weekly supermarket shop, I can appreciate the glitz and glamour of the $15m effort. Along with Shane Warne, Ash Barty, Adam Hills and a quokka, Minogue promises relief from any weariness instilled in us Poms by Brexit and Boris Johnson.Mates, what timing. I don’t wish to throw stones in a glasshouse, but it is hard to get on board with a campaign asking people to fly about as far as it is possible to fly for a holiday, when fire crews there are braced for yet another record heatwave and debate is raging about the government’s inadequate response to the climate crisis, which has seen cities shrouded in smoke and bushfires burning since September.“This year’s been tough and confusing, but progress is moving… at a glacial pace,” sing Minogue and Hills. You know what’s not moving at a glacial pace? Glaciers! Still, lovely beaches, great people, catchy song.On Instagram, Ed Sheeran has announced that he will be taking some time off to “travel, write and read” and, like the inexplicable number of people I know who have somehow managed to wangle three weeks off work this year, he has turned his out of office on, changing his profile pic to “BRB”. He may not “be right back”, however, as it sounds as if he’s planning more than a short break. In the message, he explained that he would return with new music “when the time is right and I’ve lived a little more to actually have something to write about”.Trust Sheeran to be eminently sensible about the pop grind. These days, pop stars have to knock out tracks with barely a pause for breath. No sooner is an album out in the wild than another is promised. Our attention s are unforgiving and our appetites never sated. The machine must be fed. On an artistic level, this relentless churn rarely leads to quality in fact, it is often the death knell for creativity. I always bristle when musicians release songs about being famous or being on tour, though it’s hard to blame them when those are the only experiences they can call on for inspiration.With a handful of exceptions – Bowie’s Fame, Britney’s Piece of Me – songs about being famous are usually a bore for anyone who isn’t. Few people can tap into the kind of universal experience that makes a song a hit while living a life so far removed from it. The fact that Sheeran is taking time away to find something to write about again bodes well for fans because it makes it all the less likely that his next record will be along the lines of Take Me Back to London (In My Chauffeured Limousine)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb9b6f50049f09fcc9d7e904ca6ab24fc757c6e7/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588ea5d2d1c93fd654dffc82417b8089","title":"burgers john bercows tie all men what would you put in a time capsule of the decade","story":"Ovie from Love Island and pop star Mabel are among the famous faces nominating items that sum up the 2010sIn 1989, Dr Bose invents noise-cancelling headphones so pilots can communicate more effectively.

The year of events will culminate with a major exhibition about Becket, which will open at the British Museum in October.Naomi Speakman, the exhibition’s co-curator, said: “The story of Thomas Becket’s life, death and legacy has all the hallmarks of a Game of Thrones plot. There’s drama, fame, royalty, power, envy, retribution and ultimately a brutal murder that shocked Europe.“These events had repercussions that have echoed out through time and we’re delighted to be telling this important story for the first time in a major exhibition.”Becket was killed in Canterbury Cathedral by four knights after what was interpreted as an order from King Henry II. Becket was made a saint by the Pope just over two years later and his shrine in Canterbury became a destination for pilgrims from across Europe before it was destroyed on the orders of Henry VIII in the early years of the Reformation.The British Museum said its exhibition, the title of which has not been decided, would present “Becket’s tumultuous journey: from London merchant’s son to archbishop and from a revered saint in death to a traitor in the eyes of Henry VIII over 350 years later”.It will showcase more than 100 objects associated with the archbishop, including manuscripts, jewellery, sculpture, stained glass and paintings. The exhibition will include loans from around the world, as well as artefacts from the museum’s collection.The programme of events will include a new production of TS Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral, a verse drama that depicts the assassination, performed in Canterbury Cathedral, as part of an initiative with the Marlowe Theatre in October.

Drain into a sieve, then run under the cold tap to stop the dal cooking further.Fill a large saucepan with 1.3 litres water, bring to a boil on a medium-high heat, then keep hot on a low heat.Put the rice, two tablespoons of oil, 200ml of the hot water and one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt into a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring often, until most of the water has been absorbed, then repeat, adding 200ml hot water at a time and stirring often, until you have used up 1.2 litres of the water and the rice resembles a loose, creamy porridge (it will be overcooked) – this will take about 20 minutes. Lightly crush the rice grains with the back of a spoon – you don’t want to mash them completely – then turn down the heat to medium-low.In a bowl, whisk the egg yolk, yoghurt and 50ml of the hot water until smooth, then stir the yoghurt mix into the rice and cook, stirring often, for about seven minutes, until the mixture has thickened slightly, but is still a loose porridge.While the rice is cooking, make the topping. Put three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned – about eight minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and chopped green chilli, and cook for four minutes more, until fragrant. Stir through the chana dal, garam masala, 60ml water, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chana dal starts to brown in places – about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover to keep warm.Wipe out the pan and return it to a medium-high heat. Add the remaining four tablespoons of oil and the dried and sliced chillies, and cook for three minutes, until starting to soften but not colour. Add the curry leaves, cook for another minute, until translucent, then stir in the mustard seeds and turmeric, and remove from the heat.To serve, ide the curd rice between four shallow bowls and top with the chana dal mixture. Drizzle all over with the curry leaf oil and its solids, and serve warm.This vegan take on palak paneer uses tofu soaked in a salt brine, but you can also use other vegan alternatives such as butterbeans or roast cauliflower.

Add the spinach, press it down with a spoon to submerge and blanch for about 45 seconds, until just wilted. Drain into a sieve, then run under the cold tap until it’s no longer warm to the touch. Leave the spinach to drain for no more than 10 minutes, then, without squeezing out any of the excess water, put it in a blender with the coriander leaves and blitz to a smooth paste – you may have to scrape down the sides of the blender a few times as you go. Spoon the mix into a bowl and set aside, then put 300ml water in the blender and swirl it around to pick up any remaining spinach.Put three tablespoons of oil in a large saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, fry the onion for about seven minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden. Add the garlic, ginger and chilli, and fry, stirring, for four minutes more, until fragrant and browned.

In the end, it was one moment of ill-judgment from Charlie Taylor, coupled with a clinical finish from Anthony Martial and a late breakaway strike from Marcus Rashford, that decided this encounter, which had all the festive fizz of a bottle of champagne left open since Christmas Day.But that will matter little to United, who are now only a point shy of fourth-placed Chelsea after back-to-back victories. This was far from perfect from United, but a first away clean sheet in the league since February secured with a makeshift midfield of Fred, Nemanja Matic and Andreas Pereira, who impressed throughout, represents a solid night’s work for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side as they prepare for Arsenal on New Year’s Day.Twenty-one points adrift of the league leaders is far from the ideal place to finish a decade that began with United regularly competing for major honours, but with Paul Pogba absent again here, United dominated enough of this contest to come away with a deserved victory. Burnley continue to be a pillar of inconsistency, with this their second consecutive defeat, having previously recorded successive wins. Here, they simply did not do enough to test United’s defence, meaning Martial’s first-half strike, after Taylor was dispossessed by Pereira, was always likely to be decisive.With United still waiting to discover the extent of Scott McTominay’s injury, the big pre‑match discussion again centred on Pogba. With many expecting him to start, Solskjær instead decided not to expose the Frenchman to two games in three days, and he did not even travel to Turf Moor. That meant a first league appearance since September for Matic.Solskjær had promised that United’s youthful side would be able to cope with the rigours of the festive period better than their opponents here and, despite an understandably slow pace to the game given that both had played 48 hours earlier, it was the visitors who enjoyed the brighter moments throughout the first half.Rashford was lively early on, first forcing Nick Pope into a smart save from a curling free-kick before striking the base of Pope’s post after an intricate passage of buildup play. United’s threat was just as considerable out wide, with the pace of Dan James and Brandon Williams drawing fouls from the Burnley defence, though the visitors were not able to capitalise on the resulting free-kicks.There were moments of promise for Burnley at the other end, emanating largely from their renowned aerial threat, with the pick of the opportunities coming when James Tarkowski’s header across goal narrowly eluded Jack Cork. But as half-time approached, United upped the intensity again, with the increasingly influential Williams at the heart of things.It was the young defender’s run that led to Martial’s shot being cleared off the line by Phil Bardsley before the Frenchman just failed to get on the end of a superb ball played across goal by Williams. However, Martin would not have to wait much longer for his next chance and this time, he made no mistake. When Taylor was caught in possession by Pereira, the midfielder’s wonderful through ball put Martial in. He made no mistake, slotting past Pope, and United led on the stroke of half-time. The goal had been coming.Pope was picking the ball out of his net again shortly after half-time, but on this occasion, Martial was penalised for a foul in the buildup, and the hosts slowly began to grow into the contest as the second half wore on. Dwight McNeil fired wide from a Burnley corner before David De Gea had to tip a Bardsley strike wide of his post.The chances kept coming for Burnley but they had no cutting edge. A free-kick from Johann Berg Gudmundsson shaved the top of De Gea’s goal, and at the other end, with Burnley pressing for an equaliser, Martial could have wrapped victory up in the final moments after being set free by James, but he could not provide the required finish. It would not prove to be a significant miss, and in added time Rashford rounded Pope to ensure 2019 would finish with a crucial victory for Solskjær."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1ff2f27a8cb41a404ecb7d5f3bd35e828887317/172_108_2669_1602/master/2669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76dc3d222b5e8eae117b05249cd3f255","title":"jose mourinho tottenham defensive mistakes norwich","story":"• Mourinho changed two defenders and formation at half-time• Manager hits out at defensive ‘gifts’ as team salvage 2-2 drawJosé Mourinho lambasted his defence for their mistakes after Tottenham were twice forced to come from behind in their 2-2 draw against Norwich City at Carrow Road.Spurs lost possession in the buildup to Norwich’s opening goal, scored by Mario Vrancic, and endured the embarrassment of conceding a ricocheted own goal for the home side’s second. Mourinho changed two defenders at half-time and his formation he was decidedly morose in his post‑match remarks.“Do you want me to assess the performance with defensive mistakes or without?” the Tottenham manager said. “Performance with defensive mistakes, we have to accept the result. Performance without defensive mistakes, not at all. Because we played so, so well when we had the ball. We create from minute one until minute 90.“We start the game playing well, then we had our 28th of December gift and then the team till the end of the first half felt it a little bit. Second half, we played even better than in the first half, really offensive, taking lots of risks, dominating the game, scoring the equaliser, and then with 30 minutes to win the game, gift number two.“A normal team with a normal soul would lose the game, but no. The team kept playing, the boys played even better, more intense more aggressive, pressing recovering the ball, lots of quality going forward. We scored the second goal and I thought we could even have scored the third but then it was time for Norwich to fight for that point and to defend hard, which they did.”Tottenham started with a back three, but Mourinho abandoned the formation at half-time with his team 1-0 down. He also substituted two of his defenders, Juan Foyth and Jan Vertonghen.While Mourinho was effusive in his praise for his forward players, he could not be coaxed into complimenting his defenders. Asked if he knew his preferred backline, Mourinho raised an eyebrow and said: “It’s normal, no. Do I have doubts that Harry Kane is my No 9? Do I have doubts that Dele Alli is my No 10, for example? Performances create doubts or performances kill your doubts. That’s just the way it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c811847933dd9dd910fee8547f73c06e3fe8e7/0_195_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35cdcf5c8de8f57d982b630c5fe581d5","title":"burnley v manchester united premier league live","story":"Marcus Rashford sealed United’s victory late on after Anthony Martial had given them the lead in the first halfThanks for joining me. Until we meet again.“First half we laid the foundations and in the second half we defended superbly.“I think Fred has improved a lot. He is a confident and tenacious midfielder.”On Williams: “He is never fazed, he can go forward, he can defend. You will never be afraid to put someone like Brandon in.”Maguire describes it as a “good win”. He goes on to discuss how inconsistent United have been this season.Rashford says United could have been more clinical and the team really had to grind it out. He adds the result will do a lot for the team.Daniel James was my Man of the Match. Williams, Rashford and Fred also had good games. Nice to see United grind out a result, to be honest. United were certainly the better team and deserved the win against a Burnley team who offered very little.James is the man breaking once again, he slips in Rashford, who rounds the goalkeeper, then falls over and just about slips the ball into the net to seal the win.90+4 mins: A corner to Burnley. Pope is up. It is sent deep and cleared, then pumped back in to the back post, resulting in cries for a penalty after an alleged handball. Nothing is given.90+2 mins: Fred drives United forward, spreading the play to Shaw on the left-hand side of the area, only to see the sub pass a dreadful cross which is blocked and cleared.Williams is booked for ing after being taken out by Bardsley. A woeful decision by Dean.89 mins: Burnley are keen to whack the ball into the box now but United are happy to take it. The attack breaks down when McNeil clips Williams. Shaw is on for Martial as United look to shut up the shop until New Year.87 mins: Rashford is down clutching his face after being caught by Tarkowski’s hand. It certainly isn’t a foul, though, and the forward will be fine.Brady is Burnley’s final change, replacing Cork. Will this make the difference? 85 mins: Taylor pleads for a corner and his cross is blocked by Young, claiming it hit the United man last but it actually clipped the Burnley full-back but going out.83 mins: Pope whacks a free-kick long for the Burnley forwards to battle for but it comes straight back at the Clarets, with James breaking down the pitch and the ball ending up with Martial one-on-one with Pope, who comes out quickly to narrow the angle and is sends the Frenchman backwards. Burnley regroup and crowd out United in the end, but the visitors should now be out of sight.81 mins: Taylor cleans out Young when challenging for a header after the United man beats him to it - the Burnley man avoids a second booking.79 mins: Williams breaks out of defence and dribbles up field, passing the baton onto Rashford who runs into Tarkowski in the box and the Burnley defender clears.A little treat about Pellegrini being sacked.76 mins: Cork is caught by Maguire on the edge of the area after some rare neat work from the Burnley attackers. Gudmundsson lines up the free-kick from 20 yards but he sends it marginally over.75 mins: The BT Sport ‘All Dayer’ on January 1st makes it sound like a pub crawl, is that what they are going for?73 mins: James needs lengthy treatment and in the end hobbles off to the side. Meanwhile, Lingard has replaced Pereira. 71 mins: Burnley are now playing at a respectable tempo and look dangerous on the ball. Taylor is the latest man to go in the book for fouling James, who is once again too quick for a defender and is caught on the ankle and is left on the deck. 69 mins: Wood wins a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left wing after being bundled over by Lindelof. McNeill swings it but the defence head it clear, conveniently to the least threatening player on the pitch, Phil Bardsley, who inexplicably hits a lovely drive which De Gea has to push wide. Gudmundsson has replaced Barnes as the dice are rolled. 67 mins: Rashford looks to send a pass through to Martial in the area but he collides on the edge of the box with Bardsley. It looks innocuous to me but I am sure VAR will look at it. Bardsley just does not see him coming. Nothing is given.65 mins: Barnes chests down a long pass from Bardsley but the assistant inexplicably rules him to be offside and that is the end of that chapter. Down the other end, Rashford drives into the box but Rodriguez helps out Bardsley and they force the ball behind for a corner, which culminates with Matic dragging a shot wide. 63 mins: Dyche is speaking to his backroom staff about more changes. It must be Gudmundsson next ...61 mins: With the world reeling from the news Pellegrini is out of work, Pereira takes centre stage once more by barging Taylor over. Mee goes into the book for a reckless challenge on James. Mee catches him around the knee as James does him for pace. Not a great effort from the Burnley skipper.59 mins: McNeil gets the fans going with some dynamic wing play but his cross is blocked behind by Young. Westwood swings it in but Lindelof heads it out. It comes back to McNeil who drags his shot wide from inside the area.Rodriguez on for Hendrick.Ps West Ham have sacked Pellegrini.57 mins: Taylor bends in a dangerous cross but Maguire reads it and heads clear, landing at Hendrick’s feet but he can only lift it well over the bar. Looks like Rodriguez is coming on.55 mins: Pereira drives towards the box, flicks it through to Martial who hits a clean shot from 18 yards out only to see Pope use his feet to repel the effort, proving his ankle is fine in the process. 53 mins: Burnley might need to do some business in the window, as this lot look devoid of ideas. Maybe a right winger would be a good idea if Lennon isn’t firing. Speaking of which, McNeil seems to have moved to the right. 51 mins: NO GOAL! A cross is fired into the box, Martial controls it but is then adjudged to have fouled Tarkowski, so the Frenchman smashing the ball in from six yards proves fruitless. 49 mins: Rashford tries to get the better of Tarkowski in the area but the defender does well and erts the ball out for a corner. Hendrick receives the ball 25 yards from goal and instead of slipping in Bardsley in on the overlap, he whacks a shot high and wide, much to the home fans’ chagrin. Joe Harvey offers: “It seems like the threat of Joe Hart is better than any magic spray. You think Dyche would have Pope out there short of a gaping leg wound, and even then.”47 mins: Burnley are showing some early promise that they will up the tempo in this half after a pretty sedate opening 45 minutes. Here we go again!Pope is back out for the second half. His ankle must be fine.I genuinely can’t imagine how bad Philip Schofield is at football in real life.The night gets worse for Justin Kavanagh: “For one moment there, I thought it was ine intervention that Pope was about to be subbed off and Saint Joseph would get a run-out with a big point to prove. But it’s a Hartless game.”How can Burnley change things? Gudmundsson would be good to add a bit more pace down the flank, as it things are a touch pedestrian with Hendrick there.It has not been a Christmas cracker. Both teams have played at a pretty lethargic pace but United have certainly been the better side and merit their lead. Burnley have barely threatened the centre-backs despite their hustling strikers and really need to come up with something else after the break.45 mins: Three minutes to be added on.A shambles from Taylor on the touchline as he is dispossessed by Pereira, who quickly sends in a cross to Martial. The Frenchman gets the ball out of his feet and slots home from close range. Burnley only have themselves to blame.42 mins: Hart has gone to sit back down. In other goalkeeping news: De Gea whacks the ball straight out of play. The resulting long throw ends up with Barnes in the area but he smashes his shot high and wide. 40 mins: Hart is readying himself to come on. Pope is up once more and looks like he will try to carry on. Poor Joe Hart.38 mins: Fred is dictating things in the middle of the park, his latest work puts in Williams on the left, his cross flashes along the six-yard line but Mee does well to put Martial off and it goes away. Pope rolls his ankle repositioning himself for the cross and his game could be over. Hart on?36 mins: Sean King is thinking of January: “Lots of talk of talk of Maddison, Sancho and Haland to Utd, but stick Grealish and Adama Traore in this side and United would be immense going forward.”Who will United get?34 mins: HOW HAS THAT NOT GONE IN?! Williams arrives on the overlap and lifts a cross over everyone to James at the back post, his original shot bounces out to Martial six yards from goal and he smashes it at goal, only to have it cleared off the line from Bardsley. Incredible stuff from the Burnley full-back.32 mins: Burnley finally create an attack which looks like it is going somewhere until Bardsley completely fails to find Westwood five yards away from him. United then break and it ends up with Rashford on the right who drives a cross from the byline straight at Mee who finds himself in the perfect position to stop the cross. 30 mins: Rashford thwacks another free-kick form 35 yards, which clips off the top of the wall and heads over the bar. The corner is headed clear by Bardsley, who then checks to make sure his hair is still in place.

Jack Monroe thanks the calm, reassuring presence who has helped her through 10 years of motherhoodIt’s been nearly 10 years now, and I’ve never really managed to put into words what I’m about to say, because the words are so big, and so small, and there are so many to choose from, unspoken, unbidden, I never really know where to start. So I’ll start from the beginning.I still remember the first day we met, at the Basildon coffee shop we worked in. I was new and you were laughing as you showed me the ropes: how to froth the milk differently for a cappuccino and a latte how to pour the coffee so the crema on the top was just right. You were patient with my clumsiness, and everybody respected you, and more importantly, enjoyed your company. Little did we know, then, how it would all turn out. “I think that cream is off”, you furrowed your brow, holding out a frappuccino for me to test. As I leaned in to sniff it, you dunked my head in. I flicked it at your face, and mayhem ensued.A few years, and many more practical jokes later, I nervously told you I was pregnant. You didn’t hesitate. “Anything you decide to do, anything you need, I’ll support you,” you said. I was so frightened, and you were so strong and steadfast. It’s been that way ever since. Our patchwork family – mother, father, our partners, your additional children, your parents, my parents, our partners’ parents, sisters, cousins, and everyone in between, have all helped to raise this small boy between us.We don’t fight. I don’t recall a single argument we co-operate without drama or disarray. I’ve done some stupid things in the past 10 years and you have quietly picked up the pieces each time. At every new school, after every failed relationship, you have been there with your silent reassurance. I’ve been a mess, but I’m doing OK now, and one of the threads holding this whole damn scruffy tapestry together is you.I know this may slightly embarrass you, because you are modest and humble, but I want to thank you for the last decade, as we look to the next one and whatever it holds and for the greatest gift of all – our son – who grows more like his father every day, with his big blue eyes, his ability to hold a room and make everyone feel special his generous heart. I know we don’t really do feelings, but I bloody love you, and I couldn’t have done any of this without you. I am still frightened of motherhood, but knowing that my co-pilot on this journey is you is very reassuring. You’re the best, bravest and most decent man I’ve ever met, and I consider myself lucky every single day to be raising a son with you.Merry Christmas and, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf532242825998f739ce29f873fb189158c23e8/0_135_3195_1917/master/3195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9ad452bc16a8473ab12b4cdb31a2e2","title":"michael rosen family history jewish culture","story":"Searching for the missing pieces in his family brought poet and author Michael Rosen closer to the horror of warEvery time the poet Michael Rosen found out something new about what happened to his Jewish relatives during the Holocaust, he would send a round-robin email to his extended family. “My research brought me face to face with the destiny of Jews in Europe, seen through the prism of my own family.” Suddenly, he could imagine the “very real” journeys his relatives had taken, the places they’d hidden, the fear and hope they’d felt. “Because of the kind of person I am, I wanted to tell that story.”The result is his latest book, The Missing, which will be published next week. A mixture of poetry and prose, it retraces Rosen’s journey as he searches for information about his European relatives who went “missing” before his birth in 1946.When I confess to him that reading it brought me to tears, he explains how he coped with the pain of writing it: “Anybody who’s a writer knows you have that moment of the encounter, whatever it is. And then when you write about it, to make it safe for yourself, there’s a way in which you turn it into something else. It’s very hard to describe, but I know about it in relation to the death of my son. If you write about it, you put it outside of yourself.”His son, Eddie, died 17 years ago of meningitis, at the age of 18. Rosen thinks the effort of pouring feelings into words can be transformative. “It gives you the chance to be objective. You can read it as if you are another – as if it’s not you who’s written it, it’s that bloke Michael Rosen.”Rosen grew up in postwar Britain wondering about his missing relatives. He writes: “Stories hung in the air about French and Polish great-aunts and great-uncles, who were there before the war and weren’t after. ‘What happened?’ I’d ask. ‘Don’t know,’ my family said.”And yet, he wondered, how could anyone – even the Nazis – successfully “disappear” a human being? There must be traces: letters, photographs, diaries, documents, some kind of paper trail to follow. “Frustratingly, for years, there wasn’t. And so it became this kind of challenge.”There were two aspects of the book he says he found very difficult to write. The first was his discovery, after some amazing detective work, that his paternal great-uncle Oscar and great-aunt Rachel had almost made it out of France in 1943. They missed the boat they planned to escape on by just a few days and were then captured in Nice – in fact, “it could have been a matter of hours,” Rosen says. “It was all so near, and so far.”They would have been full of hope for the future at the moment the Nazis arrived. But instead of sailing to freedom, they were immediately deported to Auschwitz on a cattle-truck train. A moving poem in the book, Dear Oscar, explores what they must have gone through on that journey: “Did you see in the dark  horror on Rachel’s face?  Did she see horror on yours?”Poetry like this appears within the book at key moments. Writing poems, Rosen says, helped him to reflect on what he was discovering and, most importantly, it allowed him to search for the feelings and memories that are missing from the factual documents he finds. “It opens up forms of empathy and emotion.”The second piece of research Rosen found hard to write about was the report of his other paternal great-uncle Martin’s arrest. Four French police officers, acting on instructions from the Nazis, describe how they entered their fellow Frenchman’s house at 2.30am one wintry night and arrested him because, as they note down, he is a Jew. In a handwritten document, they state his appearance in officious detail: 162cm tall, brown eyes, oval face, straight nose. A scar on his left cheek. They even note down his meagre clothing: “Yellow cotton trousers, a grey cotton jacket, a Basque beret and low-heeled shoes.”“I do think about vulnerability differently since then.” Eddie was his second son. Rosen, 73, who brings his third wife, Emma, to our interview, is now the father of five children and two stepchildren. He says that when he sees one of them fall over or get a cough, he becomes painfully aware of what they have been through and how vulnerable they feel. “I have to do a little check inside myself… And then I have to make a little check back that all these people are still living, aren’t they, and to remind myself that it’s not that everybody’s dead.”His mother used to tell him that if the Nazis had invaded England, he’d never have been born. Finding out what happened to his relatives demonstrated the truth of those words, he says, and made him realise that they were not just victims they were also refugees.It has made him feel more European. “If you study history, as I have done, the way in which the narrative of Britain is told is that it’s separate from Europe. But I guess my life and my family’s life are utterly European. And I don’t think I’d fully sensed that before.”He sees shadows of the way his family were treated by the Nazis in the way refugees and asylum seekers today are treated here and by Donald Trump. “Rounding up people, putting them into containments, imprisoning them, taking their papers away – all that is having resonance with me.”Unusually, the book is aimed at children aged 10 and over, as well as adults. Rosen decided to write it that way after visiting a school where a pupil denied the Holocaust to his face. “This young man put up his hand and said: ‘It didn’t happen, did it?’” As the teacher panicked, Rosen remembers counting to three and patiently saying: “Well, no, it did happen.”Until then, Rosen (a former Children’s Laureate and the son of two teachers) hadn’t planned to write a book about his family at all. But after going into other schools to talk about the Holocaust, he realised he could explain what had happened to his relatives in a way that children could understand and engage with. “I thought: this is a meaningful thing to do, this is valuable.” Plus, he suspected children would be interested in reading about the mystery of his missing relatives – and how, by following “these tiny, separate bits of paper” he had managed to find out what had happened to them. “I do see myself as a storyteller and who do I tell stories to? Largely young people.”It is important, he says, that people – particularly children – understand “how these things happen in such banal and ordinary ways. It’s the contrast between the ordinariness of my life, and how near this stuff is to it.”Perhaps, Rosen says, his book will inspire other people to tell their own stories. Perhaps one day, his own descendants will read it. And while nothing will ever fill the gap the Nazis created when they murdered Oscar, Rachel and Martin, writing the book has brought him closer to family members all over the world. “I’ve met with first and second cousins who were related to them. I’ve put them back into the family. And that’s very powerful.”The Missing is published on 2 January by Walker Books at £8.99 order from bookshop for £7.91. An exclusive extract follows“What happened to them all – the brothers and sisters in Poland and France?” I asked. Dad shrugged.“I don’t know,” he said. “They were there at the beginning of the war, but they had gone by the end. I suppose they died in the camps.”In the camps? I thought. What camps?It made me think of school holidays: we used to go camping and it nearly always rained…But Dad didn’t mean camps like that.Sometimes, on TV, they showed what concentration camps were like. They said that hundreds of thousands, probably millions, of people were killed in these camps.I used to lie in bed and think about this. It seemed horrifying. Awful. But I didn’t really get it.Why did they put my great-aunts and great-uncles in these camps? And why did they kill them?And now they were gone. No way of finding out anything at all about them. They had just disappeared. We didn’t even have any pictures of them.All that was left was my dad’s shrug.There are gaps,there are blanks,in the house of my lifethere’s a face,nothing more,something gone from my life.She was here,he was there,in the rooms of my lifethere’s a placefor them both in the wordsof my life.Written for Holocaust Memorial Day, 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd000c72ad43bf0a420403ca4aa15c52a6d39c3/0_270_4240_2544/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f01faff43e38343a5fa415818476d85","title":"tim dowling my bands last gig the story i forgot to tell","story":"The mega venue, the lost afterparty tickets, the uncompromising security...Over the course of a year, a significant portion of my life ends up committed to print. Obviously, for reasons of discretion, certain unsuitable incidents are not related, but at year’s end I almost never have occasion to say, “Here’s a story I forgot to tell.”But you know what? Here’s a story I forgot to tell.Back in March, I wrote about two full days of rehearsal for one last giant gig before the band I was in took a year off. I made the gig sound like a really big deal – which it was – and then never mentioned it again. Maybe, at the time, it was too big a deal.When the idea of playing the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire first came up a year before that, I was sceptical. I’d driven past the place loads of times and seen the names of bands I’d actually heard of emblazoned across its marquee. I asked the guitar player how many people it could hold. He told me.“Holy shit,” I said.“I know,” he said.A year later, I find myself on the pavement with the piano player, staring up at the name of our band emblazoned across the same marquee.“Holy shit,” I say.“I know,” he says, taking a picture with his phone.Wheeling some equipment across the enormous bare stage, I meet a woman who describes herself as “artists’ liaison”.“If you need anything, just come to my office,” she says.“You have an office?” I say. I am used to playing in places where you can’t get from the dressing room to the stage without going outside.Because of the two full days of rehearsal, the show is pretty slick. The guest bagpipe player comes on stage on cue, hits his mark, plays his solo and walks off in the right direction. Only once, when the lights first sweep across the house and I see 1,400 people ranged over three levels, does my jaw drop. This, I think, was never supposed to happen to me.Afterwards, we have to pack up quickly – the venue requires everything to be removed immediately. This is easy when you have roadies and a giant tour bus double-parked outside, less so when your wife dropped you off that morning on her way to the supermarket. My youngest son comes to the foot of the stage while I’m coiling up cable.“Mum lost the tickets to the afterparty,” he says.“All of them?” I say. “I gave her, like, 12.”“All of them,” he says.I spend most of the afterparty trying to source enough spare tickets to get my wife and three sons back into the building. Security is uncompromising my wristband impresses no one. I think: the Dixie Chicks played here. Did this happen to them?Eventually I source four tickets. When the afterparty ends, I detain the middle one to help me get my gear into the lift and out of the stage door. I feel weird about saying goodbye to the other band members, because we have nothing, not even a rehearsal, planned for the future. By the time we’ve ferried everything from the lift to the street, they’ve already gone anyway. I’m the last one out.My son takes my phone and calls a cab. A few minutes later, a dark car approaches, slows, and then drives on.“I think that might have been him,” I say. “Was that him?”“The driver just cancelled our trip,” the middle one says.“He saw all this stuff, and drove on!” I shout. “That’s outrageous!”“I’ll call another one,” the middle one says. A few minutes later, a different car approaches, slows, and drives off.“Is this legal?” I ask.“I’ll order it from around the corner, and then make him pull over here,” he says.The middle one walks to the end of the road, leaving me alone on the pavement with two banjos, two guitars, an amp, a harmonium, a harmonium stand, a pile of clothes and a bag full of wires. I sit down on the amp and stare at the backs of my hands.Well, I think. That was that. When I next look up, I see that the name on the marquee above my head has already been changed to the next night’s band."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c668761df427984507ce1b8ffcf0500177be62/0_286_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b770c9b7dc7c2841d7a7e4b54a519e67","title":"2010 2019 a decade in pictures","story":"’s picture editors take a look back at some of the news photography that has defined the past 10 yearsFrom the earthquake in Haiti at the start of 2010, the decade was defined by successive international refugee crises, natural disasters and conflict.

When it comes to Ashkenazi Jews, it’s true … Ashkenazi Jews might have a marginal advantage over their gentile peers when it comes to thinking better. Where their advantage more often lies is in thinking different.”That prompted furious accusations that Stephens was using the same genetics arguments that informed Nazism and white supremacist thinking.“It’s hard to read this column as expressing anything other than a belief in the genetic and cultural inferiority of non-Ashkenazi Jews it’s hard to tell if that’s intentional or due to appalling sloppiness, but either way it’s not the sort of thing the Times should be running,” tweeted Tim Marchman, editorial director of Vice.New York Times contributor Jody Rosen offered on Twitter: “Speaking as both an Ashkenazi Jew and a NYT contributor, I don’t think eugenicists should be op-ed columnists.”“A Jew endorsing the idea that certain races are inherently superior to other, lesser races, what could possibly go wrong?” asked the journalist Ashley Feinberg on Twitter.The writer Carrie Courogen posted the phone number to cancel a Times subscription, “citing ‘too many awful Bret Stephens pieces, today’s eugenics propaganda being the final straw’ as why you can ‘no longer in good conscience subscribe’. It was easy \u0026amp painless \u0026amp I just did it you can too.”Stephens’ latest column is far from his first brush with controversy.In August, he became embroiled in a dispute with a professor who had called him a “bedbug” on Twitter, after it emerged the New York Times had become infested with the insect pest. The spat ended with Stephens cancelling his Twitter account.“Time to do what I long ago promised to do,” tweeted Stephens before he deactivated his account. “Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt. Thanks to all of my followers, but I’m deactivating this account.”Stephens is a regular target of liberals’ ire for other columns attacking climate change science, saying the activist group Black Lives Matter has “some thuggish elements” and for writing a piece about “the disease of the Arab mind”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4602d05ce21240d9392db2d3f8558d14a617dd28/0_10_3398_2039/master/3398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be8dbce4ac0a68cd09fbc26e4982163","title":"2020 guardian readers stories predict","story":"We asked you what you’d like to see from our coverage in the coming year, and we received hundreds of replies from around the world - with areas of interest ranging from the climate crisis to exposing inequality and fake newsWhen it comes to summing up an entire year, sometimes a single word will do. But we went further than that this year and asked supporters and readers what stood out for them in 2019 - and what they’d like to see more of in 2020.Let’s look back before we look forward. John Crace and Marina Hyde are names that crop up again and again. It seems that the darker the times, the more we need to laugh. “In a world full of seriously depressing news, they always help me to start the day with a smile,” wrote Cynthia Legge of Crace’s sketches.How do you find the comedy in serious times? Crace said that reader support helped.“Politics has been a brutal mix of the tragic, the incompetent and the surreal and it’s sometimes been hard to find the right words to sketch it,” he said. “But I couldn’t have done it without the feedback -- mostly positive -- that I’ve had from so many readers.”“Laughs have been somewhat thin on the ground this year, but I instinctively find myself turning to Chris Grayling over and over again. He is the failure’s failure. It takes a special kind of genius to award a ferry contract to a company that has no ferries, no ferry route and whose articles of incorporation have been cut and pasted from a pizza delivery firm.”Other supporters like the lean-back format of the Long Read, som 150 of which were published in 2019. Peter Greaves reminded us of the terrifying influence machine piece, while others cited Oliver Bullough’s blow-by-blow account of how easy it is to launder money.Laura King wrote. “I particularly enjoy seeing women’s issues being covered, such as the gender problems in medicine and medical research and the interview with Hannah Dines about her vulva surgery.”Lots of readers were moved, in a rather different way, by the rise and rise of Greta Thunberg in 2019, with some citing a definitive piece by our global environment editor Jon Watts as the moment they first became aware of the teenage Swede activist.“I was jolted by the realisation that this young, lone, insignificant little person got fed up with the establishment and gave the world a shove - - and the world moved,” wrote Bob Braddock from Chattanooga Tennessee. “Ms. Thunberg continues to inspire (and to shame) us and our political and industrial leaders into taking real today-not-tomorrow steps to fight climate change.”And it was the environment that dominated suggestions for coverage in 2020. Readers called specifically for expose(acute)s and campaigns to show up the bad guys, drive best practice and help bring about a revolution in energy use and environmental activism.“How is it possible that UK supermarket chains have been allowed to replace single-use plastic bags with even more indestructible heavy duty plastic bags?” Nicky Tomkins weighed in. “I’m sorry, but that’s just wilfully stupid. I respectfully urge the  to mount one of its impressive campaigns to legally require supermarkets to supply (or sell is fine) non-plastic re-usable bags, eg:woven paper, Hessian, heavy duty cotton etc.”John Nicholas wants to see more on “the science behind climate change. How different countries are responding. How much profit people are still making from fossil fuels and making plastics. How well different countries are greening their energy. Who profits from plastic materials and which should be banned.”Richard Gilyead noted that it will require massive changes to our personal habits to avert climate change, and wants to see more on how this will affect “how we work and play”. In particular, he suggested more work on how the measure of economic progress must be decoupled from crude statistics like GDP.Of course, 2020 won’t just be about saving the planet. There’s the small matter of another race to the White House in store, starting with the first Democratic caucus in Iowa in just two weeks. Brexit and the US-China trade antagonism will continue to dominate headlines. It’s a leap year (what will you do with your extra day?) and so an Olympic year too, with plenty of notable anniversaries: the UN’s 75th birthday, Glastonbury’s 50th, and the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death.It’s also the Year of the Rat. The last time we had one of these, there was a global financial crisis (2008).A lot of readers suggested that the growing controversy around gender transitioning merited deeper enquiry in 2020, particularly the antagonism between trans-rights activists and women’s rights groups.“I would like to see  uphold its journalistic integrity and not shy away from reporting on difficult issues that affect all of us simply because it is proving to be inconvenient or embarrassing to its ideological stance,” said Melissa from Edinburgh.Another reader from London called for “a proper debate around the theme of identity and belonging but from a black person’s perspective.”“The re-surfacing of the racist agenda in the UK seems all too apparent to me,” the reader wrote, asking for anonymity. “Is it fuelled by the Brexit movement and right wing policies? How do young black people express their fears and concerns for the future amid the knife crime epidemic? Is it driven by austerity and the years of government underfunding? Why are there double standards from governing bodies when it comes to punitive action against racist fans?”Other cute suggestions from readers and supporters included:• a ‘fake news’ column rebutting the most grotesque fibs of the week• a Brexit-free news day once a week• more biking and less football• more scope for student journalists to write for the • more coverage of the World Indoor Bowls FinalsFinally, readers made a plea for joy, optimism, hope.“Give us practical articles to make it easier for busy people to help the environment in their day-to-day lives,” wrote Nicki from New Zealand. “We don’t all have time to volunteer at the weekends but we can change some habitsroutines to make a positive difference.Alice Yoch from Ottawa called for “positive stories - stories of communities that are revitalising, people who are making a difference, politicians who are bucking the trend and making things happen, innovative companies that are providing shareholder value while at the same time not raping the earth.“It’s ugly out there but there is still so much inidual and collective beauty that we need to be aware of and celebrate.”Rachel Obordo also worked on this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9283c3cdf9de4f2deacf051dc4d0bc237a6f7ac/0_78_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1f6d972609402f1ec1771dc774a672c","title":"newham price rise steepest century property newry northern ireland","story":"A former down-at-heel corner of east London, the borough of Newham, has witnessed the steepest rise in property prices in the UK this century, according to data from Halifax, while the slowest increases have been in Newry in Northern Ireland.“When I started working here 18 years ago we were lucky to get £170,000 for a terraced house,” said estate agent Ian Merchant, of Bairstow Eves in Stratford. “We thought they would never go through £200,000. Now they sell for £500,000.”Only one local authority outside of London – Brighton and Hove – was ranked in the top 10 for price growth this century.The local authority with the lowest price growth has been Newry, Mourne and Down, in the south-east of Northern Ireland, where the average price rose from £78,843 to £162,222.In late 1999, the typical home in that part of the Northern Ireland, dominated by the Mourne mountains in the south and Strangford Lough in the north, fetched a few thousand more than the average home in Newham. But today, while £250,000 will buy a four-bed, three-bathroom detached home  in about a quarter of a hectare (0.5 acres) in Newry, it’s only enough for a one-bed ex-council flat in Stratford.Four local authority areas in Northern Ireland appeared at the bottom of the table for price growth in the UK, with Newry joined by Derry, Antrim and Lisburn.The factors driving house prices in Northern Ireland are markedly different from the rest of the UK. In the early part of the century, the peace idend spurred price rises, followed by the extraordinary Celtic Tiger property boom in the Republic that reverberated across the border into Newry, before spectacularly crashing. More recently, Brexit and its impact on the border with Ireland has dominated the property market.“House prices have always been on the low side here,” said Charlie Casey, Sinn Féin councillor and chairperson on the Newry, Mourne and Down council. But with the market soaring again in the Dublin area, some people are taking advantage of low prices around Newry. “We’re roughly halfway between Dublin and Belfast and we’re finding now that some people are buying here and commuting every day on the train down to Dublin.“A hard border would have been an absolute disaster,” Casey added. “A Brexit border down the Irish sea at least leaves the island of Ireland as more of a single economic entity. Let’s see how that works out.”In Newham, the Olympics sparked a construction boom in the area, which has transformed the skyline. “I remember very well the day they announced the Olympics were coming to London,” says Merchant. “We had a three-bedder on at £200,000. The day after the announcement, we had an offer of £250,000 on it.”Newham’s mayor, Rokhsana Fiaz, wrote to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, this week following the Conservative election victory. “Of all London boroughs, Newham spends the most on temporary accommodation, a figure of some £61.1m in 2017-18. We have a housing waiting list of over 27,000, and high levels of homelessness in our borough.

In a letter to the Observer, they say the issue of antisemitism was “constantly relayed back to us on the doorstep”.The intervention will be seen as an attempt by figures on the centre and right of the party not to allow Labour’s poor performance to be underplayed. It comes amid concerns about a party review of its performance that includes the former Labour leader Ed Miliband. Some in the party fear the review, led by the independent Labour Together group, will struggle to give a frank assessment of what went wrong.Among the signatories to the letter are Mary Creagh, who lost her Wakefield seat, Emma Reynolds, who lost her Wolverhampton North East seat, Anna Turley, who was unseated in Redcar, and Phil Wilson, who lost his Sedgefield seat.“The scale of this defeat means we have to look unflinchingly at what went wrong, way beyond a simple review, welcome as that might be,” they write. “We need to be honest about why our outgoing leadership’s reflexive anti-western world view was so unpopular, and address the reasons for that unpopularity. We were rejected on doorsteps not just because of our woolly, changing position on Brexit, or in Scotland, because of our weak commitment to the union, but because the very people we were supposed to be fighting for did not think the policies in our manifesto related to their lives.”They add: “The focus on nationalisation and uncontrolled spending commitments meant people simply didn’t believe us. Sadly, this was particularly true with those most affected by the poverty and injustice that 10 years of Tory government has created.“Lastly, the cronyism at the top of our party and repeated unwillingness to stand up to the stain of antisemitism was constantly relayed back to us on the doorstep, shaming the traditional values of our once great anti-racist party.“It is our duty to speak up now, so that our party leadership candidates keep these people at the heart of their campaigns to lead our party. The challenge for the eventual winner is immense. We need to win 150 seats in every corner of the country, gaining votes from a coalition of communities. Labour needs to be in government – and for that, fundamental change at the top of our party is required. Only this will help us recover from the catastrophic loss.”The letter comes with the race to replace Jeremy Corbyn still unclear, with only the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and the frontbencher Clive Lewis declaring their intention to run. The date of the election has not yet been set.Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, who had been widely seen as the favoured candidate of the party’s powerful left, is still regarded as a likely candidate, but has not yet set out her position since Labour’s election loss. Party chairman and Corbyn ally Ian Lavery is also keeping his options open, suggesting that the party’s left has not yet settled on a single candidate. Other likely candidates include Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, and backbenchers Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/804ff9846900cbf010b9dbf315064c631dcb1ea3/0_36_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a262b43efd4842fb1f4c64934409ad0f","title":"oddest foreign office queries 2019 request 50 cent phone number","story":"Inquiry from Nigeria is one of 10 most unusual dealt with by UK diplomatic staff this yearComplaints about airline food, queries about moving furniture into small flats and a request for a rapper’s phone number are among the more unlikely queries UK diplomatic staff dealt with this year.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has published its annual unofficial top 10 list of trivial inquiries from the 330,000 calls taken by staff in 2019, as a means to draw attention to what consular services can and cannot do to assist Britons overseas.Among the calls highlighted was a man requesting the FCO change him to a different airline for his return to the UK from a holiday, as the food served on the plane there was unsatisfactory.One British couple considering moving to Portugal contacted the UK embassy in Lisbon to ask how removal companies were able to shift bulky items of furniture into small flats in the city. A woman in Sweden called to ask what she should wear to an event she was due to attend at Windsor Castle.Another inquiry from a caller in Nigeria concerned a request for British officials to pass on the telephone number of the New York-born rapper 50 Cent.Other missives were less unlikely, if similarly ambitious. One person asked whether consular staff in France could call a hotel where they had been staying to retrieve a pair of headphones, while a woman emailed the consulate in Texas asking to buy 30 sheets of A4 paper as she could not find any.One man rang to seek consular assistance to replace a broken television in the hospital ward where his friend was staying in Australia.The FCO said the list was issued in the hope of reminding people what embassies and consular services can do, such as issuing emergency passports, helping Britons overseas who are in hospital or jail, or providing details of local services such as lawyers and doctors.“While we can’t hand out famous rappers’ phone numbers, collect your lost property or advise on Windsor Castle’s dress code, our dedicated consular staff are there to help Brits who run into trouble when they’re abroad,” a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b9fe31a4781699593d7f3c7a26029ce12aa01a5/109_14_2751_1651/master/2751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb48457404fe5bfe646e5f3ff7f9d6ce","title":"andy murray pulls out australian open","story":"Andy Murray, who has struggled with injury since the Davis Cup finals six weeks ago, has withdrawn from the ATP Cup, due to start in three cities across Australia on Friday, and the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on 20 January.Minor setbacks to his rehab programme and slow recovery from a pelvic problem have dissuaded the former world No 1 from going back on the Tour until February. He will continue practising at home to build up fitness.Murray’s withdrawal from the new ATP Cup initially threw into confusion the participation of the Great Britain team, who needed his protected ranking to earn a place in the tournament. Britain’s leading player, Kyle Edmund, who was in excellent form in the Davis Cup finals, did not have a sufficiently high ATP ranking to enable the team to make the list, and has since committed to playing in Qatar and Adelaide.However, it is understood the GB team, who will be based in Sydney, will now seek a replacement for Murray. Great Britain have drawn Bulgaria in their first tie of Group C in the new 24-team format, with Dan Evans, ranked 42nd in the world, to open the tie against the world No 424, Dimitar Kuzmanov. Murray was scheduled to play his old rival Grigor Dimitrov in the night match.Murray had to be persuaded to use his protected ranking when the final details of the ATP Cup were confirmed, so his doubts about his fitness have been in place for a little while. When he chose to spend Christmas at home with his young family rather than commit to his usual winter training block in Miami doubts grew. However, he gave no clear indication until Saturday that he was not fit to travel to Australia.He picked up an elbow injury when winning his first tournament in two and a half years, in Antwerp in October, and stretched his physical resources to the limit in a tough five-setter against the then world No 179 Tallon Griekspoor in the Davis Cup, during which a groin strain flared.Murray’s team hope he can return in February – he has entered Rotterdam and Montpellier – but he has given no guarantees. His withdrawal from the Australian leg of his season is a blow to what was shaping as an encouraging comeback from his second hip operation in January. His movement, speed and stamina were improving steadily and, after winning a doubles tournament at Queen’s in the summer, his confidence was high.Given the physical trauma of surgery and the frustrating stretches he endured after his first hip operation the previous January, Murray can look back on 2019 with satisfaction. He won 11 of 18 matches on the Tour, won titles in singles and doubles, earned $369,000 in ticking-over prize money and had a major documentary, Resurfacing, which went into some detail about his fight to return.However, he has said several times he will not rush his comeback, at the age of 32, in what is clearly the final stage of his long career. Murray hopes to extend his playing days as long as he can and his major target in 2020 will be defending his Olympic title in Tokyo.That seems the most realistic route back for Murray to win major honours, given the early matches in the Olympic tournament are the best of three sets. The prospect of enduring a fortnight’s examination of his fitness and form in best-of-five matches at the highest level in a grand slam tournament did not look promising.Murray has been more relaxed about his career since coming through the hip problem, which threatened to end his playing days after his first-round lost to Roberto Bautista Agut at the Australian Open 12 months ago. Patience has been a virtue so far he is not about to abandon that and risk a further setback."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1da215a54c33869e8980c01b5fe9cb76e5c3efea/192_210_3324_1994/master/3324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce98444dd58647c03567bf74202237a","title":"harlequins leicester premiership rugby union report","story":"Two teams played here as if they had forgotten how to win. In the end, they forgot how to lose as well. A 30-30 cliffhanger might suggest rather more quality than was on show here, at the Big Game Whatever Number That Is Now. The truth is Quins threw this game away, but scraps from the table is all Leicester are after these days. They duly took them, Telusa Veainu levelling the scores with five minutes to go, after Leicester had trailed 27-13 on the hour.One area the Tigers did dominate was at scrum time, even if the referee’s interpretations had Paul Gustard seething afterwards. “I think we were the most dominant team by far,” he said. “It feels more like a loss. I’m gutted and disappointed with the referee today. There was one offside given all game. We were on the wrong end of the penalty count in open play, yet we were the one team playing with ball in hand.”Will Collier carried the can for multiple Quins infringements at scrum time and saw yellow to render Quins vulnerable at the most vulnerable stage of the game. He had just replaced Kyle Sinckler, who left the field limping ominously with the Six Nations heaving into view. With Joe Marler pressed into emergency service at tighthead, Leicester’s advancing scrum set the stage for Veainu’s late score.The draw leaves Leicester looking over their shoulders still, with Wasps rediscovering their winning touch and Saracens on the hunt all those points adrift. We know Dai Young cancelled Christmas for Wasps, with some effect, winning at Bristol at the death on Friday night. It is hard to imagine Geordan Murphy encouraged his boys to fill their stockings over the festive season, either. This strong finish might vindicate any policy of austerity, but no one at Welford Road is going to be fooled by another mediocre showing beyond the set piece.Undoubtedly, the highlights of the match were supplied by the “home” team, with Leicester almost entirely absent in the first half. A win here could have moved Quins into the top four for the new year. They were the most proactive throughout. One sequence of interplay between backs and forwards in the first half was particularly pleasing on the eye, if worthless on the scoreboard, and the one try of the opening period was theirs.Danny Care looked as lively as anyone. A menacing dart down the left set up an attacking scrum. Marler and Sinckler held their England colleagues at that one, and from the platform Care sent Paul Lasike charging through Kyle Eastmond for as uncomplicated a try as a Harlequins fan is used to. That accounted for their seven-point lead at the break.It was over to Eastmond, then, to try to trigger a response, which he did early in the second half, when he intercepted Sinckler’s wild pass to sprint home from his own half and level the scores. Alas, all that did was to provoke Quins, and the role reversal was neat.A chastened Sinckler rampaged through Leicester’s defence to set up the position from which Elia Elia was held up. From the scrum, Lasike acted as dummy this time, and Care fed Marcus Smith, lurking behind, who picked on Eastmond just as mercilessly. Having stepped through the latter’s tackle he cut past two more for Quins’ second try.Eastmond did not survive the indignity, hauled off a few minutes later, but Sinckler had one last charge before he too departed, in his case with that worrying limp. England’s tighthead charged close from Quins’ latest foray, and England’s loosehead Marler drove his captain, Chris Robshaw, over for their third.A 14-point deficit finally roused Leicester. Jordan Taufua looks the closest the Tigers have to an invigorating new presence. There was nothing new about the penalty-to-the-corner routine they twice pursued, but the way he was driven through the heart of Harlequins’ lineout was decisive if nothing else.Step forward George Ford on the stage he knows so well. England’s maestro, off the back of another retreating Quins scrum, now rearranged following Collier’s yellow, chipped to where Harlequins were undermanned, having withdrawn a back, and Veainu was haring to the posts to draw Leicester level.It was more or less Leicester’s sole flash of class. Not enough, perhaps, to save a great club from danger, but something to build upon at least. That it should come to this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d02017fb069b9a64a1c7134841fe86e86598b06/0_168_3912_2346/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31de1b1fda8f316c03b3a32c39cc373d","title":"south africa england first test day three match report","story":"England’s highest opening partnership for three years, 92, allowed the travelling faithful to dream. But are two cricketing miracles really possible within six months? After South Africa were finally bowled out for 272 on a pitch that is supposed to be deteriorating, England were set 376 to win.“Surely not possible” mumbled the sages and statisticians. England have a team ravaged by the most obstinate of bugs they have been scrappy in the field, where some of their strategies have been strange on a surface where any self-respecting pace bowler fancies his chances. They were required to pursue the highest score of the match here, where it was rumoured the South Africa hierarchy was beaming when Joe Root chose to bowl on the first morning.Yet the dreams were still flickering thanks to a gem of an innings from Rory Burns, who was unbeaten on 77 at the close. He had some luck, which is probably essential for any surviving batsman here. He was dropped at first slip, on 20, by Rassie van der Dussen and there were a few close calls. But in between he timed the ball exquisitely, especially through his favoured leg-side against the paciest of the South Africans. He is starting to fit at the top of the order.Burns was given doughty support from Dominic Sibley, whose 29 was his highest score in Test cricket. He was gutsy and ungainly, except when clipping the ball away on the leg-side, while keeping Burns company for 28 overs. His dismissal was tame as he became the first to succumb to a spin bowler in the match, plopping a short ball from Keshav Maharaj straight back to the bowler. Still, England ended on 121 for one. Only another 255 required. There is still hope – which is remarkable given how the tourists began the day.It was hard to imagine how they could have started more shambolically, though it was not entirely their fault. Jos Buttler became the 10th player in the party to be laid low on this tour. At least Jonny Bairstow was around to take over behind the stumps, which was not the case in New Zealand. Soon it became evident that Root was suffering as well. He would join Buttler in the stands to leave Ben Stokes in charge then he returned to the field, despite a fever, partly to ensure that he would be able to bat in his normal position. When assessing this England performance it is worth remembering that no tour party for half a century has tried to function with so many men diminished by illness.Captain Joe Root and keeper Jos Buttler became the latest England players to be struck down by illness in South Africa. Buttler felt unwell on arrival at the ground, a frustratingly familiar story on a tour beset by sickness and flu-like symptoms, leaving Jonny Bairstow to retake the wicketkeeping gloves.Root lasted 40 minutes before he too began to feel under the weather, spending another 40 minutes in quarantine before briefly rejoining the fray looking decidedly unwell. Root and Buttler were both absent as England returned to the field after lunch but the captain later reappeared in the afternoon session. Root was the 10th member of the squad to report sick, with four members of the backroom staff similarly affected:Captain Joe RootAll-rounder and vice-captain Ben Stokes (dehydration on day one)Wicketkeeper Jos ButtlerBowler Stuart BroadBowler Jofra ArcherBowler Mark WoodBowler Jack LeachBatsman Ollie PopeBatsman Joe DenlyAll-rounder Chris WoakesEven so, the self-destructive streak of this side was in evidence in a chaotic first session when South Africa were able to ransack 125 runs from 24 overs for the loss of three wickets, one of whom was Anrich Nortje, the nightwatchman, who must have thought that Christmas had come a few days’ late.On Friday, his frailty against the short-pitched delivery had been exposed. Usually he headed towards the square-leg umpire. There is no disgrace in that for a dedicated No 11. So imagine Nortje’s glee when he was confronted by Sam Curran rather than Jofra Archer at the start.He did not receive a bouncer until the 24th minute of the day, whereupon he was given out. However, Nortje’s requested review demonstrated that Curran’s delivery had brushed his shoulder rather than his bat. Now he started to enjoy himself alongside Van der Dussen and his confidence soared along with the run rate. They stole tight singles, the shies kept missing the stumps and then the boundaries started to flow.When Archer was introduced an English review for lbw against Van der Dussen resulted only in an umpire’s call. Eventually a similar delivery from Archer defeated Van der Dussen and this time he was the unsuccessful reviewer. Still, he had already registered his maiden Test fifty and this unlikely pairing had added 81 runs in the morning.Quinton de Kock began spectacularly. All too predictably he was bounced by Archer – and he plays the short ball rather better than Nortje. Two consecutive sixes disappeared into the crowd beyond the leg-side boundary. Archer then had Nortje caught at short-leg from a rib-tickler for an unlikely 40, applauded deliriously by another good crowd.De Kock continued to attack Archer with vigour but at the other end Stokes was starting to pose problems in a manner that raises questions about how he is used as a bowler.There have been many unwelcome complications this week and it is understandable that England should not bargain for more than a dozen overs per day from Stokes. What is less comprehensible is when he is used as the bowler of the last resort. On his day he can be as potent as any of the others. Currently, he is part of a five-man pace attack but that does not mean he should always be the fifth bowler summoned. Sometimes his overs should be delivered relatively early in the innings. He was as dangerous as anyone and soon he was rewarded with the wicket of Dwaine Pretorius, neatly caught at slip by Sibley.There were more travails for England after lunch as the last three wickets added another 75. De Kock was more circumspect against anyone but Archer – because they were bowling a conventional length at him – and he edged to Bairstow off Stokes. Maharaj and Vernon Philander eventually fell to short balls from Curran and Archer, who finished with a five-wicket haul (for 102) that he is unlikely to remember with any great affection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac48338491378b624d40eaeebcd77a9ec12e552a/0_1134_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ba35bea61ab641e801739ad249beef","title":"alfie allen game of thrones six pack","story":"The Emmy-nominated actor (and Lily’s little brother) talks new films, family and fatherhoodWhen Alfie Allen was nominated for an Emmy earlier this year, for his performance in Game Of Thrones, many were quick to point out that the boy from the 2007 Lily Allen single Alfie had finally proved his big sister wrong. In the song, Lily pleads with her weed-smoking little brother to get off his “lazy arse” and stop wasting his life away. After eight seasons of HBO’s epic fantasy drama, Allen, 33, appeared to have done just that. But the truth is more complicated.It didn’t bother him that people might have him pegged as a waster? “She was on the rise. She was killing it. I was like: as long as it helps your creative juices flow, then go for it. I just remember asking for it not to be a single – but then obviously record labels don’t give a shit what family members think, do they? So that was that.” Alfie, released as a double A-side with Shame For You, peaked at No 15 in the UK charts.If the gamechanging Emmy nomination for his role as Theon Greyjoy hasn’t drawn a line under the song, then this next chapter certainly will. Prior to Game Of Thrones, Allen’s most high-profile work was fleeting roles in films such as Atonement (2007) and The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Next month, he’ll star alongside Scarlett Johansson in the black comedy Jojo Rabbit, which won the top prize at the Toronto film festival. In spring, he’ll play the love interest in the highly anticipated big-screen adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age novel How To Build A Girl he’ll also appear in the forthcoming true crime mini-series White House Farm, with Stephen Graham.It’s a sunny autumnal day when I meet Allen, who is casually dressed in a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt, black cap and shorts, by the pool at his secluded hotel‑style apartment building in a bohemian part of Los Angeles. It’s a temporary living arrangement that could turn into something more permanent: he has a one-year-old daughter, Arrow, with his former partner, Allie Teilz, a DJ who is based here.I imagine he is enjoying a more settled lifestyle after being contracted to a juggernaut such as Game Of Thrones for almost a decade. Is it like being released back into civilisation: no more schedules, night shoots or relentless promo tours?“I was excited to move on, without a doubt,” Allen says. “I think there was always that fear from when we started: God, you know, this is going to be for quite a while. You don’t want to get sucked into thinking negatively about something that’s essentially a very positive thing, but I would fluctuate. The majority of the time, the feeling for me was: I either give it my all, or I piss and moan about it. Even if you are going to piss and moan about something, you’re going to use that emotion to the betterment of your character, and that’s what I tried to do.”A record 10 cast members were nominated for an Emmy this year, including Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington was there competition between them when the cameras stopped rolling?“At the beginning, me, Kit Harington and Richard Madden were definitely in some sort of competition about who could be in the best shape. It’s not like we were comparing, but there was definitely a macho vibe going around,” he cackles. “But I wouldn’t say there was competition in any sense other than who had the best six-pack. And Kit will always win that.”Allen admits his judgment of the finale may be impaired by the fact that he was so satisfied with his own character’s heroic demise in episode three. He says it allowed him to move on from the show in a positive way particularly as his character was so polarising and damaged Theon orchestrated and endured violence so brutal that he was, in one season, captured, castrated and treated like a pet, mockingly named Reek. “It felt very isolating,” Allen says of the role. “The character was ridiculed at times.” Jojo Rabbit, which has Golden Globe nominations and has been tipped for Oscars, couldn’t have come along at a better time. Allen auditioned fresh from a post-Game Of Thrones holiday, looking for something new. Directed by the New Zealand director Taika Waititi (What We Do In The Shadows), the film is certainly unconventional. Set in Nazi Germany, it follows a single mother (Johansson) raising a 10-year-old son who is desperate to join the Hitler Youth and has an imaginary friend, a goofball version of Hitler, played by Waititi himself. Allen plays Finkel, the second-in-command to Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) who runs the youth camp. It’s deeply moving at times, but its comedic treatment of the subject matter has polarised critics.How To Build A Girl is a family affair for Allen. Lily has a small cameo and their mother, Alison Owen, produced it. Allen laughs awkwardly when I mention this. Did his path cross with his mother’s when he was filming? “She was there. Mum is very committed, very professional. She’s not one of those in-and-outs,” he says jovially, suddenly sounding very cockney.With Owen and actor Keith Allen for parents, Allen and his older sister had a childhood that exposed them to parental narcissism, drugs and often neglect, according to Lily’s 2018 memoir My Thoughts Exactly, but Allen is reluctant to talk about it. Did he read the book? “I did. I thought it was brilliant. It’s really important that everybody is allowed to have their own truth. Lily’s book was beautifully written. I was scared about reading it, but then I found it to be really beneficial.”Are he and Lily close these days? He nods.I ask what his upbringing taught him about being a parent. “Oh God,” he replies. Another pause. “I don’t know. Just that you have to just, you know – know that we all are in it together. We are all going to go through these similar journeys together, so let’s be nice.” What’s he like as a dad? “I’m very lovey-dovey. I like to put her on my chest. She’s the cutest little thing and I can’t wait till I get to see her.”When Allen was in his 20s, and better known as the boy in the Lily Allen song than for anything else, he was portrayed in the tabloids as a bit of a party animal, hanging out at music festivals and rolling out of clubs. Dating Ray Winstone’s daughter Jaime – a fixture on the London social circuit – on and off for seven years probably didn’t help. The pair even appeared on a night out in a Madness music video in 2009. Do people’s misconceptions bother him?Walking me out, he says there is something exciting on the cards in the new year, but that he’s still grappling with how he feels about it. “It’s really dark and controversial,” he says, “but there’s a certain amount of humanity they want me to bring to it…” I say it sounds like an ideal next move, but Allen is still thinking about my last question.“I think I am ambitious, but I don’t want to lose sight of my own emotional integrity and happiness.

Following the change in policy, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took out advertisements on Facebook purposely making false statements to draw attention to the policy.Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, over the policy change in a congressional hearing in October. “Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of factchecking on political advertisements?” Ocasio-Cortez asked, as Zuckerberg struggled to answer. “So, you won’t take down lies or you will take down lies?”Meanwhile, other tech companies took the opposite stance. TikTok, whose reported 500 million users makes it one of Facebook’s largest rivals, made clear in a blogpost in October it would not be hosting any political advertisements.And Facebook rival Twitter banned almost all political advertising in October. Google stated in November it would no longer allow political advertisers to target voters based on their political affiliations.At one time, tech giant acquisitions were shrugged at. But the instant skepticism that met Google’s acquisition of Fitbit represented a shift in how regulatory agencies are looking at big tech: investigations are coming.Throughout the year, tech giants faced congressional hearings on issues such as privacy, antitrust and misinformation. The US Congress announced in June it would investigate tech firms over anti-competitive behavior. In July, Facebook, Google, and Amazon faced a grilling before the House subcommittee regarding antitrust. A week later, the US justice department announced it was opening a broad antitrust review into Facebook, Alphabet’s Google, Amazon and Apple.Shortly after, Facebook said it had agreed to pay a record $5bn penalty in the US for mishandling user data in the Cambridge Analytica breach.Later in 2019, Facebook’s Zuckerberg spent hours in the hot seat as Congress members grilled him over the social media giant’s privacy practices and its plans to launch a digital currency.While the hearings did not immediately result in legislative action, the tone of questioning underscored growing bipartisan animosity against tech executives.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said Facebook showed “breathtaking arrogance” in attempting to launch a digital financial service after a number of major privacy scandals and called Facebook “dangerous”.In 2019, US lawmakers and regulatory agencies began to direct at tech firms the kind of criticism that has been advancing in the European Union for years. In the year since the the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018, the US has started to look at its own regulation addressing what data is collected on its citizens.“Throughout the world, you see that people are fed up and you see more and more laws popping up,” Yared said. “And it’s coming to the US now.”As the average American became more aware of the privacy issues and the magnitude of data collection, calls for legislation intensified, said Hayley Tsukayama, a legislative activist at the not-for-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation. Major scandals such as Cambridge Analytica and Amazon’s growing network of Ring doorbells have caused voters to request more action from their lawmakers.“We have heard from many lawmakers saying they introduced legislation due to calls they were getting from constituents,” she said. “In a lot of cases, people will say they do not like what Google or Facebook is doing, they find an ad creepy or are upset about an invasion of privacy.”The calls for better privacy protections have grown steadily each year and show no sign of slowing down, said Chris Babel, chief executive officer of privacy compliance firm TrustArc. Consumers are increasingly aware of privacy violations after their own data was mishandled by Equifax, Facebook and in other massive breaches.“Privacy has become an even bigger theme in 2019,” Babel said. “Things have fundamentally changed – consumers care more about their personal information than they did in the past, and businesses do, too.” In 2019, over 150 pieces of legislation on consumer data were considered in the US on the state and federal level as criticism over the companies’ growing reach and power intensifies.Nevada, Maine, Washington, New York, Texas, Oregon and Maryland all passed laws related to data breach notification requirements, privacy and cybersecurity in 2019.The California Consumer Privacy Act, which was passed in 2018, was finalized in 2019 and is set to go into effect on 1 January 2020. It is set to enact privacy regulations similar to Europe’s GDPR, giving consumers the right to know what data is kept on them and request it be deleted.Among consumers and legislators alike, 2019 brought a growing awareness that the explosion of the gig economy has come with huge challenges for workers.California attempted to address that in September 2019 when it passed a landmark workers’ rights bill threatening to upend the gig economy. The bill, known as AB5, will change the way contract workers are classified. With tech giants including Uber and Lyft headquartered in California, the bill is likely to resonate far beyond state lines.When the law goes into effect in January 2020, it will implement a three-part standard for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors, requiring that (a) they are free from the company’s control, (b) they are doing work that isn’t central to the company’s business and (c) they have an independent business in that industry.Gig economy startups, including Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have pledged millions of dollars against the bill, threatening to fund a ballot initiative to counteract it in 2020.Tech companies also faced intense backlash from within – the year of 2019 was “pivotal for worker organizing”, said Shona Clarkson, an organizer at Gig Workers Rising said.The rise in activism marked a breaking point for the gig economy, Clarkson noted, with workers increasingly uniting to address workplace issues affecting employees at all levels.“This was a year we saw workers rising up across the board,” Clarkson said. “It is long overdue – workers have been suffering within tech since the industry began, and now we are seeing the rising up of workers who are building the power necessary to win.”At Google, repercussions from internal protests over sexual harassment policies that began in November 2018 continued into 2019. Workers at fundraising startup Kickstarter organized to fight for workers rights. Gig workers at Instacart and Uber also organized strikes to fight for better pay and benefits.Companies have responded by allegedly cracking down on worker activists. Google hired an anti-union security firm and fired at least five employees involved in organizing. Two Kickstarter employees allege they were fired over their activism.The protests were not only over worker treatment, but technology’s responsibility to larger political issues. In June, workers at online furnishings retailer Wayfair walked out of the job to protest the company’s contracts with detention centers for immigrants. In July, Amazon workers and activists protested the company’s contracts with government agencies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_234_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc1341c808d0e89b37a34007895a089a","title":"10 best winter walks uk 2019","story":"Frosty landscapes, pale winter light and the promise of a pub fire … nothing blows away the post-Christmas cobwebs like a bracing walk. Our writers pick 10 great trails“Unless a man understands the Weald, he cannot easily write about the beginnings of England,” Hilaire Belloc noted early in the last century, admiring “all that roll of land which lies held between and above the chalk of south-eastern England” and that crosses Sussex, Kent, Surrey, Hampshire.The point at which the High Weald arcs into Kent is to my eye the English landscape at its most sublime – a stretch of ancient woodland and oast housed-prettiness, where the combination of earth scent and leaf shade seems to suggest that here the land sits at its deepest. Every season brings its own particular joy for walkers, but the winter months hold the landscape’s subtlest pleasures: goldcrests, linnets and hawfinches frosted hazel and hornbeam the red hips of the wild dog rose. The paths are clay, and soft underfoot, which makes for occasionally muddy though always pleasurable walking.Head out from St Dunstan’s Church in Cranbrook. Known as the Cathedral of the Weald, the church is more than 500 years old, and the depictions of the pagan Green Man, in both wooden shields and a porch stone carving, nod to the time when the surrounding area was covered by dense forest. From here you head northwards, away from the town and the main road and out into woodland. There is an intimacy to the landscape here, in part due to the patchwork of small, oddly shaped fields, a remnant of medieval times when the land was first cleared for farming: the hedgerows you pass today evolved out of the strips of woodland – or “shaws” – that once ided them.This particular walk is long, though easy to abbreviate, and guides you through some of the county’s agricultural history – past fruit orchards, hopper huts that housed workers from London during the picking season, former millponds, and clothiers’ houses. At one point you will spill out on to the intriguingly named Digdog Lane — so-called for the stray dogs that would dig up plague victims buried in the land nearby.The jewel in the walk is undoubtedly Sissinghurst Castle, once home to the writer Vita Sackville-West and her husband, author and diplomat Harold Nicolson. Over the course of 30 years, the couple transformed the one-time farmstead into one of the most revered gardens in England. Winter, when Sackville-West’s exuberant planting stands in relief, is a fine moment to relish the formality of Nicolson’s garden design: the series of garden rooms and immaculate hedges, the long walk of pleached limes.From the castle you may turn towards Sissinghurst itself, a handsome village built on the wealth of the Wealden iron and cloth industries, and then back to Cranbrook. Or head east towards the Three Chimneys, an oak-beamed and open-fired freehouse, winner of the Good Pub Guide’s county dining award, and a fine place to sample Kentish ale.Laura Barton, journalist and author of Twenty-One LocksStartfinish A832 by Loch MareeDistancetime 4 miles3½ hoursRefuel Kinlochewe Hotel, KinlocheweSetting out from the luscious banks of Loch Maree, this walk climbs through pine woods to an icy quartzite plateau with stupendous mountain views. The ascent is hard work, but the steepness makes it special. In few other places can walkers cross so many habitats, or seem to see so many seasons, quite this quickly.The ascent is up a well-marked but extremely rugged path that’s unalleviated by flat ground (a free guide to the route can be picked up in the car park). It’s worth taking this route up Coille na Glas Leitir (the Wood of the Grey Slope) slowly, because there’s an extraordinary amount to see. The pines on the lower slopes accommodate rich communities of mosses and liverworts. Look out for pine martens and woodland birds. Soon, these tall trees give way to stunted rowans and the bird-life becomes sparse. But an eagle – white-tailed or golden – might drift above.Climb higher, and things get stranger. Look for polygonal patterns of frost heave underfoot, and spiny prostrate junipers that cower in fissures in the rock. You might spot flurries of snow buntings, and even orange liverwort (the species is found in only four known sites the other three are in Norway). The greatest appeal of this walk, however, is the scale of the view as you breach the plateau. This is the kind of scene that you can only usually get from the highest peaks (which would require crampons and ice axe) catch it on a cold, clear day and these mountains will be etched in your memory for ever.Winter sees the Peak District at its bleakest, but as vegetation disappears and pasture is stripped of wildlife, the landscape gives up clues to its history. The linear village of Chelmorton is famous for its distinctive pattern of drystone walls, which delineate thin strips of land said to predate the enclosure acts. From Main Street, the hill of Chelmorton Low, topped by two prehistoric tumuli, looms over the village. At its foot is St John the Baptist, said to be the highest church in Derbyshire, where a golden locust weather vane glints atop the spire.The road ends at Bank Pit Spring where Illy Willy Water cascades into an underground stream. The uphill path runs through the remains of a rake, a mined vertical vein of lead. Some of the undulating grassy mounds in the fields are old mine workings. The industrial is never far away in the Peak District.At the top, it is worth taking a short detour along the concessionary path to Five Wells cairn, one of the UK’s highest megalithic burial chambers, with fine views across Taddington Moor. There are many ancient tombs on the hills around Chelmorton, most of them excavated (or desecrated, depending on your point of view) by Victorian antiquarians.Back on the bridleway, tramp through the fields until you meet the Limestone Way, the long-distance footpath through the White Peak plateau. Head towards the village of Flagg, whose Elizabethan manor was once renowned for its “haunted” skull, which repelled all attempts to give it a decent burial.The final leg, crossing fields on signposted footpaths, leads to a junction known as Chelmorton Thorn, a reminder of the old tradition of planting hawthorn bushes at crossroads and other liminal places. From here, it drops back down into Chelmorton and the 18th-century Church Inn, with its excellent food and an open fire that keeps temperatures inside close to tropical. A welcome contrast to the Peak District bite.Sarah Ward, author of the DC Connie Childs crime novels (Faber Books)For a journey into winter wonderland, the circular walk up Meall a’Bhuachaille (the Shepherd’s Hill) takes some beating. Stunning views, rare wildlife and native woodland regeneration: think of this walk as a whisky the Cairngorms distilled into pure, rich form. Climbing this peak, I always experience “that joyous release of body” that Nan Shepherd terms feyness.From the visitor centre, follow a track uphill through the forest. Keep your eyes peeled for red squirrels, roe deer and pine martens. As the track narrows to a path, you emerge on to open southern slopes. The hard edge of the forest is beginning to soften. Deer are carefully managed to enable pine, birch and willow trees to self-seed and grow up the hill. Among the new seedlings, regal old granny pines stand tall. When the sun reflects off the snow, the crowns of these 100-year-old survivors glow a wonderful warm copper colour.Gaining the ridge, continue uphill to the bulky granite cairn. At 810 metres high, there are excellent views across Glenmore Forest, the Cairngorms plateau, the Moray Firth and – on an exceptionally clear day – Ben Nevis. It can be very cold and windy, so lunch is best saved for the shelter of Ryvoan bothy then turn right along the Thieves Road, an old drovers’ route that was also used by fearsome cateran (cattle raiders). The track leads into a dramatic glacial valley: meltwater once poured through this channel now the steep sides are lined with regenerating Caledonian forest.Leave the track for a moment to visit Lochan Uaine (the Green Lochan). The water is a distinctive turquoise because fairies wash their clothes here (although the wee people must struggle in winter, because the lochan is often frozen).Turn right on a smaller path that soon winds uphill through beautiful old Scots pines with views to the Northern Corries. A gentle descent on forest track leads back to your starting point. Call into the Reindeer Centre to see if Rudolph is at home. Finish up in the cosy wood-panelled Pine Marten Bar for a taste of Cairngorm après ski.• Check weather forecast and mountain guide advice before setting off, walkhighlandsAnna Fleming, writer and climber, whose book, Time on Rock: A Climber’s Route into the Mountains, will be published by Canongate in 2022Pick up an almond croissant from the town’s Angel Bakery. You’ll need energy, because after a gentle (pre)amble past the castle, along the River Usk and then under the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal using a low, vaulted, dripping foot tunnel, you start the steep ascent of the Blorenge. The climb follows the route of Hill’s Tramroad, built in the 1820s to transport pig iron and limestone to the canal, a reminder of the area’s rich industrial heritage. Luckily, the stone sleepers are still there to provide steps.Two-thirds of the way up, turn left and follow the mercifully flatter path along the Cwm Craf, a hollow on Blorenge’s north-east face, past Keeper’s Pond, cradled by the Punchbowl, once the scene of bare-knuckle fights, and along a sunken road between huge, ancient trees described by Richard Mabey as “a whirlpool of wood … immense gargoyles of beech”.Climb again now, above the trees, squelching through bog and gorse, to the bleak, tussocky summit plateau, the world around you opening up. To the north the Skirrid and Sugar Loaf loom proprietorially over Abergavenny to the west is Pen y Fan, south Wales’ highest peak and to the south the Bristol Channel glints under the winter sun, if you are so blessed. Take extra clothes, for the Blorenge can be a beast when she blows.Near the summit (561 metres) is a bronze age burial site, and a plaque marking the place where Foxhunter, a champion showjumper, was buried in 1959. The ashes of his rider, Sir Harry Llewellyn, were scattered on the same spot in 1999. Find a place in the lee of rocks to eat your sandwiches and contemplate the two words in the English language that rhyme with orange. You’re sitting on one.Turn for home now, the hard work done, dropping down around the western flank of the mountain, past a Somme-like wasteland on the hillside, until recently a magnificent larch wood before the rampaging ramorum disease wiped it out.Back in Abergavenny, bag one of the sumptuous leather sofas next to the roaring fire in the wood-panelled Foxhunter bar of the Angel Hotel – 2020 Cesar Welsh Hotel of the Year – and order a pint of Sir Harry, named after the late, great showjumper. You will have earned it.Mike Carter, whose latest book is All Together Now: One Man’s Walk in Search of His Father and a Lost EnglandIt would be perfect to arrive in picturesque Clare by train to start this stroll amid quietly magical countryside, but Richard Beeching took that from us in the 1960s. The ornate Victorian station building is now the friendly, warm Platform One cafe.Clare country park is hard to tear yourself away from, with its lofty ruins of a Norman castle, its greens, woods, old priory, ponds and railway platforms. And then there’s one of southern England’s most charismatic rivers, the Stour, of Constable fame. His most famous painting, at Flatford Mill, depicts scenes 30 miles south-east, in the more frequented Dedham Vale. But Clare revels in its relative obscurity, with a profusion of well-signposted walks starting from the country park.This route to another characterful village, Cavendish, takes walkers south initially, past the handsome Mill House and across the Stour into Essex. Here it turns east along a never-ending line of hedgerows alive with the flitterings of small birds, including linnets and corn buntings. In front of 16th-century Bower Hall, the swiftly flowing Stour is shrouded by willows, a perfect spot to watch for kingfishers and, less likely, the otters now re-established on this stretch. Nearing Cavendish, at Pentlow hamlet, an evocative early medieval church, St Gregory’s, with an unusual round tower and in great nick, appears between trees.Now turning north and crossing the river back into Suffolk, the route passes gardens and eccentric cottages as it enters Cavendish. The unpretentious, Greene King-serving Five Bells commands the large village green and is an ideal pit stop. Behind is St Mary’s church, where it’s claimed that in 1381 the local big cheese, John Cavendish, was seized, later to be killed in revenge for the slaying of peasants’ revolt leader Wat Tyler.Cross the green and pass the cemetery to head west across low hills and vast fields, gold, green and black under the lowering winter sun, and through woody dips back to Clare. The village finally appears below, dominated by yet another Grade I-listed church. Drop in at the traditionally styled Swan, which serves Adnams, Timothy Taylor’s Landlord and solid homemade pub grub, including four veggie options and pizzas. But beer aficionados who aren’t hungry might prefer to walk through the village for 10 minutes to The Globe, a lively Camra-award winner, with guest ales and live bands. Both are dog friendly.• clarewalksAdam McCulloch, author of the Kent Walks Near London guideNew Year’s Day is my New Year’s Eve. I celebrate when the first light of a new year hits the skies. For day one I need to be outside, with a face full of cold sea air and a view of some broiling waves. This walk delivers exactly that. It is a point-to-point walk along the North Cornwall coastal path. The path is clear but requires scrambling in places. It’s one of those you might decide upon casually, perhaps the morning after a night in St Ives, thinking a walk to a pub would be nice then halfway through you remember it’s four hours long and that’s quite a long time. After a couple of hours, the headland becomes wild Atlantic coast. You might see seals below, basking on black rocks by turquoise, ice-cold water. You consider scrambling down the cliffside to strip off and dunk yourself in that refreshing scene as a baptism of faith – in the days and seasons to come. The walk becomes a meditation of sorts, where all that needs to happen is to reach point B and you will find civilisation again but for now the work of putting one foot in front of the other brings space and peace.Just when you feel thoroughly fatigued you take the path away from the sea to Zennor, and find yourself in a low-ceilinged 13th-century inn with a roaring fire, ordering thick-cut salty chips and sipping cold beer through wind-chapped lips. DH Lawrence called Zennor “the most beautiful place”, with a view of the “infinite Atlantic … lovelier even than the Mediterranean … It is the best place I have been in, I think.” Made even lovelier by arriving on foot, the whole walk is a fantastic way to process the year past and begin anew.On reaching Zennor you can book a taxi back to St Ives, or take the bus, although as there are no buses on New Year’s Day, you could make this a circular walk back through the countryside, via Tremedda and Trevalgan – a total distance of 12 miles.• stivesKate Friend, photographerAt the entrance to the Kentmere valley a perfect wooded dome rises behind the village of Staveley. The path enters Craggy Woods at a small wooden gate on the back road to Littlewood, then traverses the hillside beneath the eponymous vaulting crags. The route winds its way steeply, affording views south over the valley of the River Kent. Buzzards frequent Craggy, as the wood is known, and with the right conditions they can be heard mewing contact calls as they surf thermals.On reaching the top, the rewards are great. Not only do walkers continue at the level of the ancient beech canopy, but looking north, a zen landscape of rocky outcrops and sheltering field hawthorn unfolds, leading the eye into the head of the Kentmere valley and the summits of Shipman Knotts, Kentmere Pike, Froswick, Ill Bell and Yoke.The path continues through a sheltered vale of ancient yew and beech, accumulations of last season’s golden leaves and beech mast crunching underfoot, then passes a pair of four-foot-high stone obelisks. The pillars mark the position of air-vents used during the construction of the Thirlmere-to-Manchester aqueduct. This feat of engineering, which opened in 1894, transports water directly from the centre of the Lake District 96 miles into the heart of Manchester, and tunnels directly underneath the wooded hillside. It’s the longest gravity-fed aqueduct in Britain – there’s not a single pump along the route.Elsewhere, a series of black gates inserted into drystone walls mark the ongoing route of the aqueduct.At the woodland boundary turn right over the fields to Littlewood, along the lanes at the back of Craggy, passing beneath the slopes of Potter Fell and winding past a discreet little tarn hidden behind an outcrop fusion of rock and tree.Staveley offers a choice of excellent hostelries, from the Mill Yard’s Wilf’s Café, on the banks of the River Kent, More Bakery or, further along the main street, ale and good grub at the Eagle and Child. Karen Lloyd, author of The Blackbird DiariesA shifting and moody landscape, one minute frozen solid, then squelching through mud, this is the perfect walk to shift gear into winter. It’s not a taxing route, but encourages a steady rhythm, allowing the mind to wander and random conversation to ensue while bumping into the odd fell runner or solo walker. The landscape provides a rich tapestry of colours and textures you can’t help but pause to take in, savouring the moment and allowing yourself the pleasure of setting your own pace.Dick Hudsons Pub was formerly a hostelry that was famous for its food and wine between 1850 and 1878, long before it was taken over by the eponymous Mr Hudson, who was a farmer and food lover. A cosy country pub complete with roaring log fire, it welcomes “muddy boots and paws”. Savour a hot chocolate or a warming whisky as you look out onto one of the best views in the country and plan your next ramble.• See another version of this walk at ilkleymoor.orgShanaz Gulzar, presenter of Yorkshire Walks on BBC Four, available on BBC iPlayerTaking in some of Northern Ireland’s most picturesque coastal towns and villages, this 16-mile trek sees beachy vistas and country parks give way to tucked-away treasures and much more besides.After taking in postcard-worthy panoramas at the esplanade in Holywood, start off in the morning towards Bangor via the Royal North Yacht Club. In this first section, navigating a little public footpath before rejoining the coastal path is a pay-off in itself – with the consistent promise of beautifully rugged coastline, by way of winding gravel and asphalt pathways, blooms of winter wildflowers, offshore grey seals and a soul-affirming sea breeze.A jewel in the crown of windswept North Down, even in winter, Helen’s Bay Beach in Crawfordsburn country park is as idyllic as it comes. Set aside some time to take in its gently shelving sands, which are framed by the wooded headlands and meadows.Ready for a little rest? Mosey into the village of Crawfordsburn to warm up in The Old Inn, which is also a fine boutique hotel (doubles from £80 B\u0026ampB) located on one of the island’s most ancient highways, leading from Holywood Priory to the Parent Abbey at Bangor.Still kicking? A further two-mile amble down the coast to rest up at the supremely cosy Grace Neill’s in Donaghadee will seal the deal. Opened in 1611, it’s a perfectly secluded little inn to come into from out of the cold, sip a hot whiskey and reflect upon sore heels and a day well spent.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

This walk takes in his favourite views, his local pub and final resting place‘The Woolpack is my local. It used to be, as the name suggests, a place where the pack horses from the hills, bringing the wool down to the Stroud mills, used to stop for refreshment. It’s got great character, as you can see.”I certainly could see. Laurie Lee had invited me to his local to talk about a television programme I wanted to make about him and the ways in which this part of his world and its landscapes had shaped his writing. It was early spring 1994, and we were chatting in the bar that he reckoned had not changed all that much in generations – apart, that is, from the price of its beer. That initial meeting had led to a series of recorded conversations. Now, 25 years on and following their publication, I was going back to walk Laurie Lee’s valley.I decided to begin my walk in The Woolpack Inn. Less than three miles north of the Cotswolds town of Stroud, it’s the only pub in Slad, the tiny village in which Laurie had spent his early years. The circular walk, at a pace appropriate to the style of the writer in whose footsteps I was walking, would take me about 2½ hours. It’s a walk you can round off with a late lunch in his local – in “his” bar, even.The day I had chosen was bitterly cold but bright, the sky a deep blue there had been an overnight dusting of snow. After a warming coffee in The Woolpack (it opens at midday) I set off along the road up the hill. After no more than a few hundred yards, I paused … looking down the steep slope towards the house in which Laurie spent his childhood, one understands immediately the significance to him of the physical character of this area of Gloucestershire. “Living in our valley was like broad beans in a pod,” he wrote. “All my beginnings were hatched into this very compact series of narrow, brief valleys, which are like seed pods.”Just beyond the house I took a right fork, and leaving the busy road I followed the lane, passing some houses dating back to the 17th century. In those days this lane was the only road through the village, hugged by The Woolpack and a few houses as it followed the contours of the valley. A new road, slightly above, was built in the 1830s. Both the school Laurie attended and Holy Trinity, the church in which he sang as part of the choir, followed. The Woolpack, according to Laurie, just added a storey and turned to face the passing trade on the new road.I followed the lane as it wound its way down to the valley bottom and then took the path adjacent to the village pond. It’s a mill pond, one of a number in the area that were built to drive a series of woollen mills that once helped shape the character of the valley and its cottage industries. Most of the ponds were destroyed in a great storm in the distant past, but this one, unlike the woollen mills it once served, survived. Laurie had brought me here in 1994, to emphasise just how special it had been for him. Back in his youth it had been one of the regular haunts of the village boys and girls, as they gathered for “fun, games and secrecy. It was the centre of all our juvenile recreations, from winter skating to summer bathing.”In spring, its banks are covered in daffodils in summer, stargazer lilies burst through. It’s home to families of mallards, coots and dabchicks.The pond and the dabchick were the inspiration for some of Laurie’s childhood writing. In July 1925, aged 11, he won a prize for an essay about the dabchick in a competition organised by the RSPB. In beautiful copper-plate handwriting it begins: “A dabchick or a little grebe is a waterbird. Its haunts are rivers, ponds and lakes. It is called a dabchick because it dabs and dips very well.”In winter the pond has an altogether different feel my only companions were a pair of mallards and an egret, peering into the dark water from the pond’s edge. As I was shivering just a little beside the cold stillness of the water, it was time to move on. I followed the path up through the field, keeping close to the hedge on my right. There’s a kissing gate in the corner at the top of the field, on the edge of a wood. I went through the gate and made my way along the valley side towards Furners Farm (now a bed and breakfast). Once through the woodland there were fine views across the valley back towards the village, bathed in warm, low, winter light.I stopped to take a look. It was now so cold that my toes and fingers were beginning to feel numb and I could see my breath clearly. It was this intense, bone-chilling, winter weather that inspired some of Laurie’s early poetry, especially for a poem commissioned by the BBC in the early 1940s, in the depths of a freezing cold winter of war. Christmas Landscape begins:Tonight the wind gnawsWith teeth of glass,The jackdaw shiversIn caged branches of iron,The stars have talons.That’s how it felt to me as I moved on, crunching along the frosty path, past an old apple orchard. The path took me through what had once been the farmyard, then left up the lane to a crossroads. I turned right, following the road as it dropped and swept round to the tiny hamlet of Elcombe. There was smoke drifting upwards from fires burning in the hearths of cottages the cottagers, I imagined, huddled cosily around them.Coming out of the wood, I turned left and followed the track as it climbed and drifted to the right. It leads to the magnificent Swift’s Hill, commanding, as Laurie put it, “the whole of the valley like a great ancestral hump”.Around the hill I spotted the remains of small quarries where, he recalled, a quarry man from Elcombe used to pick up ragstone and limestone to repair and build any number of the drystone walls in the area. Laurie once characterised his good friend, the poet Frank Mansell, as “Cotswold as a drystone wall”. For Laurie and many others, the drystone wall is an elemental part of the Cotswolds landscape.The views from the summit of Swift’s Hill, especially on a cold and clear winter afternoon, were breathtaking. Slad was easy to spot, its houses “snug, enclosed and protective” in the hillside like “peas in a pod”. To the south-west the landscape unfolded towards Stroud and, beyond, backlit by the sun, the vale of the River Severn … superb.There is so much that is special about Swift’s Hill. It’s home to a host of rare chalk plants, including no fewer than 14 different species of orchid. There is archaeological evidence of continuous settlement on the hill dating from the stone age: that sense of continuity was as important to Laurie as the inordinate beauty of the natural landscape.“It’s not only the trees and the stones and the houses, it’s the people,” he reckoned. “They are all equally endemic, they are rooted to this part. They are the valley, they are the Cotswolds.”I left the hill, following the steep path down to the road, passing Knapp Farm – another nod to the important role the woollen industry played round here – and then following the footpath sign to Upper Vatch Farm. I clambered over a stile and crossed the field, enjoying the splendid views towards Swift’s Hill, the afternoon winter sun casting long shadows across the landscape. I followed the path, crossing another pond and a small apple orchard to yet another stile. Now I was retracing my route from earlier in the day, through Furners Farm and on towards the village pond.I passed on old hay meadow on the left. This was the field where, in the height of summer haymaking, the young Laurie Lee encountered Rosie, in a scene that has become one of the best-known in 20th-century English writing.“We did not go over there to be seduced, we went over there to be a man and to help the men with the haymaking, but there was always, well not always, a Rosie type in the grass, waiting to waylay one of we sturdy lads … I stuck my fork into the ringing ground and followed her like doom.”That was then. On my walk there was no one waiting anywhere to waylay anyone. It was far too cold and getting colder as the sun began to disappear over the hill. I headed back more quickly now, beside the pond, up the lane and into the village. Before I reached The Woolpack I crossed the road and followed the path to the church. During our conversations in 1994, Laurie had reflected on matters of life and death.“I’ve found a place halfway up the churchyard, near enough to the church to be aware of, in a spiritual sense, matins on Sunday morning, but also to be within reach of, in a temporal way, orgies on Saturday nights in The Woolpack. And alternating between the temporal and the spiritual is the way I wish to spend what eternity is left to me.”He was true to his word. He died on 13 May 1997, and he’s buried in the churchyard, just as he had requested. His grave overlooks The Woolpack. Inside the church I took a moment to gaze at the window devoted to his life. It was funded by Laurie’s family and a public appeal. The beautiful stained glass panels include a map of Spain, a violin and his distinctive signature. It’s an elegant tribute to his life in the village and beyond.I stayed a little longer and looked at the small exhibition devoted to his life, then crossed the road and returned to The Woolpack. With photographs and paintings of Laurie, and a good selection of his books scattered around the bars like confetti, the pub has become almost a shrine to Slad’s most famous son.It was 3pm my walk had taken two and a half hours. As I sat in the bar, I could not help but reflect on my first meeting with Laurie, 25 years earlier. At one point in our conversation his thoughts turned to the history of the area. “My village, Slad, didn’t have much history,” he reflected, almost regretfully. I know what he meant. Slad was never the setting for the great battles that shaped England’s destiny, or the location of the fine houses of its kings and queens. Its history is altogether more modest. It’s woven like a tapestry through the stories of its families, its houses, its fields, its buildings and, of course these days, though he would never have admitted as much, through the life of Laurie Lee himself.• Laurie Lee: Down in the Valley – A Writer’s Landscape, the edited conversations between Laurie Lee and David Parker, is published by Penguin Classics (£12.99 or £9.74 at  Bookshop)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Photograph: Nick BradshawThere is only one candidate for the story of 2019 in Irish politics: Brexit dominated everything. So much did Irish politics progress in the shadow of Brexit that for long periods it seemed that the true epicentre of Irish politics was in Westminster, or occasionally, Brussels. That was how the year began, and that was how the year ended.Twelve months ago, a weakened Theresa May finally concluded a withdrawal agreement with the EU after months of painstaking and painful negotiations. But the House of Commons threw it back at her with a record defeat. She began the new year determined to try again, but – despite concessions, extensions and missed deadlines – May couldn’t deliver the majority.On May 24th, having failed for the third time to get the withdrawal agreement passed, she announced her resignation. After a lengthy leadership battle Boris Johnson was elected Conservative leader, and became prime minister.GovernmentIn Dublin, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar played it cool, waiting days for a phone call and weeks for a meeting with the new occupant of Number 10. When the two men did meet, they seemed to rather hit it off. Varadkar told Johnson on the steps of Government Buildings that Ireland would be Athena to his Hercules. “Ring me!” gestured Johnson as he departed.They met again in New York and then, with the clock ticking towards a no-deal Brexit, Varadkar dashed to the Wirral near Liverpool for a supposedly private meeting. They emerged hours later with the makings of a deal: changes to the withdrawal agreement that Ireland could live with and that Johnson could pass.Johnson accepted some checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK Varadkar gave up the backstop. It was now, the headlines shouted, a “frontstop”.It was the deal that unlocked agreement, and unlocked Brexit. Johnson promising to “get Brexit done”, romping home in the subsequent election.But if Varadkar played Brexit cannily, he spent much of the year under domestic pressure.Early in the year, the Government was hammered on the spiralling costs of the Children’s Hospital project, about which it seemed frequently unsure. At the same time the cost of the national broadband plan, an ambitious design to bring high-speed broadband to every home and premises in Ireland (whether they wanted it or not) was also rocketing towards €3 billion.With overspending across a range of Government departments – health led the way as usual – and the sharp criticism of the Fiscal Advisory Council for its budgetary plans, Fine Gael’s reputation for prudent and responsible management of the public finances, always more vaunted within the party than without, took a battering.The trouble with Fine Gael, social welfare minister Regina Doherty told an RTÉ interview, is that we have been too prudent and too responsible. This was not a proposition for which there was an abundance of evidence in 2019.Appreciating the reality of this, the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe cleverly used the threat of a no-deal budget to dampen expectations of a giveaway pre-election budget. It went some way towards rehabilitating Fine Gael’s economic management credentials, even if that remains very much a work in progress.By and large, the various strands of the opposition observed the traditional practice of demanding responsible budgeting while endorsing the spending demands of every lobby group that knocked on their door.Micheál Martin’s late-year difficulties with his TDs’ curious voting habits demonstrated once again that his biggest problems are often found in his own party. Yet he finishes the year in a better position to put together a coalition than does his chief rival.It was a difficult year for the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who presided over a massacre of half its local authority seats at the local and European elections in May. The party took refuge in incessant campaigning for a united Ireland as the answer to Brexit, but this seemed more designed to comfort its supporters than convince unionists.The party took solace in a spectacular byelection win in Dublin Mid-West and in John Finucane’s unseating of Nigel Dodds (facilitated by the SDLP standing aside) in North Belfast in the UK general election.But the decline in the party’s vote across Northern Ireland showed that it is not just in the Republic where Sinn Féin declined this year. The once-irresistible rise of Sinn Féin has not just been arrested it has gone into reverse. The next election could decide the future of Mary Lou McDonald’s leadership.For the Green Party, new possibilities opened up this year. The party capitalised on public concern about climate change to record its best ever local and European results and has the opportunity next year for a significant breakthrough if it can maintain momentum.Leader Eamon Ryan has his sights set on government, though many within his party are nervous about the compromises required to wield power – and about doing a coalition deal with either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Ryan knows it will have to be one or the other.The Labour Party, still scarred from its last experience of government, made some progress towards reviving itself this year, with decent local election results (they outpolled the Greens) and good showings in the Wexford and Fingal byelections. But the party’s chances of a meaningful comeback remain concentrated in a handful of constituencies. Even if it succeeds, the question of government will be a difficult one for the party.ConductThe year saw a sharp focus on the conduct of inidual TDs. Maria Bailey’s personal injuries case against a Dublin hotel became a cause célèbre which spiralled out of control for her after a disastrous radio interview. The controversy ultimately resulted in her being removed from the party’s general election ticket.Fianna Fáil TDs Timmy Dooley, Niall Collins, Lisa Chambers and Barry Cowen apologised after voting irregularities, while the Galway Independent Noel Grealish was widely criticised after comments about asylum seekers at a public meeting, and further accusations about immigrants’ remittances to their home countries in the Dail.The Fine Gael candidate in the Wexford byelection Verona Murphy also apologised after comments about asylum seekers, and her continued position on the general election ticket remains an open question as the year ends. The year demonstrated that the immigration and\u0026nbspasylum issue is edging its way into Irish politics – but also that there is little tolerance in any party or the media for anti-immigrant rhetoric.Dara Murphy opened a sore for Fine Gael that will fester through to the general election. If this year is anything to go by, that campaign is likely to feature aggressive media scrutiny of candidates.Meanwhile, the preparations for the inevitable election continue. Like in the movie Casablanca (sure to be on television over Christmas), they wait, and wait, and wait..."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4126690.1577546328!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government exposes addresses of new year honours recipients","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish musician Sir Elton John who was recognised in British Queen Elizabeth’s new year’s honours list was one of those who had his address published. File photograph: Vickie FloresEPAMore than 1,000 celebrities, government employees and politicians who received honours in Queen Elizabeth’s new year list have reportedly had their home and work addresses posted on a government website.The accidental disclosure of a tranche of personal details of those being celebrated for their service to British society is likely to be considered a major security breach, particularly as senior police and ministry of defence staff were among those whose potentially sensitive addresses were made public.Many of the more than a dozen ministry employees and senior counter-terrorism officers who received honours had their home addresses revealed, along with countless others who may believe the disclosure has put them in a vulnerable position.Prominent public figures including the musician Elton John, the cricketer Ben Stokes, NHS England’s chief executive, Simon Stevens, the politicians Iain Duncan Smith and Diana Johnson, and the former director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders were among those whose home addresses were published.Others included Jonathan Jones, the permanent secretary of the government’s legal department, and John Manzoni, the cabinet office permanent secretary.A member of the public contacted the  after downloading a spreadsheet from the government website page where the 2020 new year honours list was posted.It is thought the document seen by the , which contains the details of 1,097 people, went online at 10.30pm on Friday and was taken down in the early hours of Saturday.A small number of ministry of defence staff who had been named publicly in the honours list had their addresses redacted in the spreadsheet. However, the vast majority of people had their house numbers, street names and postcodes included.A cabinet office spokesperson apologised for the error and said it had reported itself to the Information Commissioner’s Office.“A version of the New Year honours 2020 list was published in error which contained recipients’ addresses,” the spokesperson said.“The information was removed as soon as possible. We apologise to all those affected and are looking into how this happened. We have reported the matter to the ICO and are contacting all those affected directly.”The honours list was drawn up and approved during Theresa May’s premiership.The ICO has been contacted for comment. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4125454.1577460645!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"partisanship sates a deep lust for belonging in america","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJaden Rams (13), yells his support for Donald Trump, the then Republican presidential candidate, during a rally in Grand Junction, Colorado in October 2016. Three years later, Rams would call the presidential campaign and its aftermath “a travesty for American unity”. File photograph:  Damon WinterNew York Times Politics is increasingly likened to sport in its tribal allegiances. This is to do sport an unconscionable disservice. The authentic fan is healthily cynical about their own team, after all. Scathing, even. Blind enthusiasm tends to be the mark of the try-hard newcomer. No, a political party is capable of inspiring a kind of mob loyalty – a credulity – that is well beyond a mere Manchester United or New England Patriots to arouse.The point was made again last week, when the US House of Representatives voted almost exactly along party lines in the impeachment of President Donald Trump. As for the public, from whom politicians take their cue, surveys record almost all Democrats supporting the action and almost all Republicans opposed. A voter’s political priors are the best predictor of their judgment on this question. The balance of evidence matters less, as does the president’s near-confession in front of television cameras when the Ukraine scandal first broke.The depth of American partisanship is well understood. The reasons for it are not. We know that supreme court nominees are confirmed by narrower, bitterer margins than in the days of cross-party unanimity. We know that no president has won 400 electoral college votes since 1988. We know that Republicans once renounced their own president, Richard Nixon, in a way that is hard to imagine 45 years later. Right-wing noiseWe just do not know why. Explanations come as grand as the absence of a geopolitical threat to bring Americans together since the fall of the USSR. They come as small as the deregulation of broadcast media in the 1980s, exposing Americans to Fox News’s right-wing noise and the too-easy liberalism of the Daily Show.As another partisan decade winds down, I wonder if the ultimate answer is simply the human need to belong. As politics was coarsening in the 1990s, the Harvard academic Robert Putnam was recording the collapse of associational life in the US. Americans, who had once found meaning and togetherness in trade unions, bowling clubs and other voluntary groups, were less and less likely to belong to such things. The US had a giant market and a formidable state, but not a textured civil society to fill the space in between. And this was before the decline in religious affiliation that constitutes perhaps the single most important social trend since then.Seen from this angle, political tribalism starts to make more sense. Perhaps it is nothing so much as a substitute for these vanished forms of human contact. It allows an atomised inidual to plug into a kind of fellowship. It sets up an Other against which one might define oneself. What it might lack in face-to-face intimacy, it makes up for with an enclosed world of partisan media, in which a person need never leave the (virtual) company of the like-minded.Notice the unimportance of ideological content here. Trump overturned a generation of laissez-faire economics and interventionist foreign policy and Republicans still cherished him over dozens of politicians of superior doctrinal purity. If he reverts back again – and he has, a bit – they remain with him yet. What matters is his aggression on behalf of the tribe. People crave the fellow-feeling, not the substance.Social fragmentationIt is hard to establish a causal link between atomisation and political tribalism. As with other theories for the rise of partisanship, all we have to go on is historic correlation. The social fragmentation that Putnam documented took place between the mid-1970s and the millennium. America’s bipartisan politics broke down over more or less the same period, from the (relatively) cross-party ousting of Nixon to the hardened tribes of 1990s Washington. Last week’s impeachment vote is the terminal point of at least three decades of my-party-right-or-wrong. Reversing this baleful trend will require a clearer understanding of why it emerged in the first place than any leading politician has demonstrated so far.In a debate with fellow Democrats this month, Joe Biden showed his nostalgia for the collaborative Washington of his early career. Such sweetness of intent explains his national popularity, but it also leads him to underrate the problem at hand. The former vice-president tends to imply that the old dealmaking culture faltered through a lack of goodwill among political elites or something equally fixable in short order. His rival Pete Buttigieg is another who sets huge store in conciliatory leadership as the way to a more unified America. The deeper structural and even psychological forces behind partisanship, the possibility that elites are merely channelling an animus that already festers in the country – these are missed in the haze. Source of identityFor millions, politics has become less a means to an end than a source of identity and belonging that used to come from other things. If this is right, then the US will not overcome partisanship by refining the manners of its political class. It will need to revive the associative life that used to provide citizens with those spiritual essentials. One of these tasks is easier than the other.In 1974, Republicans could turn against one of their own because Republicanism was not the basis of their entire identity. That is true of fewer conservatives in 2019, and fewer liberals too. The extent to which people now build their sense of self on their political affiliation is grim. But in the absence of other collectives in which to subsume themselves, it might also be entirely natural. The human impulse to associate takes whatever outlet it can find. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Priti Patel: violence on Britain\u0026#39s streets is being fuelled by guns, knives and drugs trafficked from abroadBoris Johnson takes lead on EU talks as Brexit unit gets rebrandedHS2 could undermine the \u0026#39infrastructure revolution\u0026#39 that Boris Johnson has promised, former government aide warnsComment: HS2 is a super turkey.

syrians seek shelter olive groves assad bombings intensify","story":"A man rides in a truck as civilians flee a Syrian military offensive in Idlib province on the main road near Hazano, SyriaIn the olive groves of north-west Syria, tarpaulin sheets stretched across barren trees do little to keep out the sleeting rain.The families huddle for warmth as the temperatures drop to nearly zero degrees celsius. Babies are bundled in coats and blankets, the adults burn wood and use up the last of their dwindling gas supplies. They are among the 235,000 people who have fled air strikes and shelling elsewhere in Idlib province in recent weeks. The exodus was triggered by ramped-up Syrian and Russian attacks on some of the most densely populated areas of the country’s last-remaining rebel bastion.So many have fled in such a short period that even the sprawling makeshift tent cities that abut the Turkish border are now full, forcing thousands to sleep out in the open.Aid agencies warn the situation is untenable and is now threatening to turn into one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the eight-year war. Syrians are seen with their belongings who have been forced to displace due to the ongoing attacks carried out by Assad regime and Russia, during winter season at makeshift tent area in Harbanos town of Idlib, Syria Even President Donald Trump, who is not usually moved to speak out about the plight of Syrians, tweeted on Thursday: “Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib Province. “Don’t do it! Most of the 3.5 million people living in the province had been displaced from formerly rebel-held areas across the country and as a result have nowhere left to go.Turkey, which is already hosting the largest number of refugees of any country in the world, closed the frontier with Syria in response to the 2015 migrant crisis and built a wall to stem the flow.They have been sending in truckloads of aid into Idlib and accepting some of its most urgent medical cases, but have signalled they are not prepared to offer much else.It is in Europe’s interest to help avoid a large-scale humanitarian disaster. Ankara has threatened to send new arrivals its way if it is pressured to open the border.Syrian families, who have been forced to displace despite attacks carried out by Assad regime and Russia, sit on soil field despite the cold weather during winter season at Harbanush village in Idlib, SyriaEarlier this month, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, told the EU to prepare for a “new wave” of Syrian refugees, saying his country “will not carry the migration burden alone.”Civilians in Idlib say they feel abandoned by Turkey, which has been the opposition’s main backer during the uprising against the government.Turkey has been strengthening its alliance with Russia, a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, in recent months. Western diplomats say they believe Ankara agreed something of a quid pro quo with Moscow - if the latter turns a blind eye to the former’s operation against Syrian Kurdish militias, it will not stand in its way over Idlib. The move has effectively sold out the revolution.Families unable to find tents due to overcrowding sleep under the olive grovesMustafa Sejari, a senior official in the Turkey-backed rebel Syrian National Army, pleaded with Mr Erdogan in an open letter, asking for him to take a “historic stand” by opening Turkey’s borders to women and children, and resuming military support to opposition forces.The Syrian offensive is part of the regime’s strategy to secure the M4 and M5 highways running through Idlib, both key routes connecting the government-controlled cities of Aleppo and Hama with capital Damascus.Assad has promised to retake “every inch” of Syria, but the rebels, who are largely aligned with Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), have had years to dig in.The city of Maaret al-Numan, which had a population of around 100,000, has been at the centre of Assad’s most recent campaign. It had become known for its fierce resistance to the regime, but also in more recent times for its resistance to HTS and the hardline groups who overran it.Intense shelling and strikes has driven out virtually the entire population. Footage captured by a handful of remaining residents shows a decimated ghosttown.Dareen Khalifa, a Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group, said she believed government forces have been “overcompensating” for the slow progress made so far in Idlib by using “devastating levels of air force.”A smoke plume billows following a reported Syrian government air strike on a residential district of Maaret al-Numan in the northwestern Idlib province“If the regime continues and if the rebels don’t surrender, this will mean the worst humanitarian disaster we’ve seen in Syria,” she said. “The casualties and displacement levels are catastrophic.”Mahmoud Sadeq, a 30-year-old father of two young children, was forced to flee his house in Maaret al-Numan last week. “On Friday, Dec 20, we woke up to the sound of warplanes and airstrikes,” he told the  by phone. “The regime and Russia began a brutal aerial assault as well as shelling from troops on the ground. Friday is a day to remember because the bombing didn’t stop for a minute, it was continuous, fierce, and hysterical.“I waited until the bombing eased down. By dawn of Saturday, I rode a motorbike with my wife and two children, who are three years old and one month old, and we fled the city towards Binnish in the northeast of Idlib, I drove slowly because the weather was so cold, so we suffered a lot, the trip took two hours.”The family is now seeking shelter in a building next to an orchid field. All they managed to take with them was a change of clothes, a gas cylinder for cooking, a small amount of food supplies and photographs. Few places are safe. Earlier this month a refugee camp was bombed, leaving at least 16 civilians dead and 50 wounded. There have been at least 65 attacks on 47 health facilities in Idlib since the offensive began in earnest in April, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS). Earlier this year, UN officials alleged Russian forces may be deliberately targeting hospitals and schools as a tactic to terrorise civilians - accusations denied by both Damascus and Moscow.The UN in Syria on Tuesday sent an email to local NGOs saying its request for a pause in fighting had been met, and encouraged people in Maarat al-Numan to leave. Hours later, Russian warplanes bombed a school, killing six children.The bombing campaign has killed more than 5,262 civilians, including 246 children, since April, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group. More than 100 of whom died in the last week.Russia and China last week vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have allowed aid to continue flowing to Idlib. The UN, US and its European partners have been able to do little other than issue statements of condemnation.“It seems that 2019 was the year the international community and the UN completely abandoned Syria and politicians have even run out of words of condemnation,” said Raed Al Saleh, head of the White Helmets civil defence this week. “My biggest fear as the year comes to a close is for the attacks to intensify further, causing new waves of displacement because there is nowhere left for people to run to. Every olive tree has become a tent and every camp has exceeded its capacity ten times over,” he said. “I still cannot understand how the world’s most powerful nations can meet those horrors with silence and inaction.”Tony Blair sought EU funding while trying to stop BrexitThree-quarters want BBC licence fee abolished, poll findsPolice using AI tech with \u0026#39troubling\u0026#39 secrecy, says former MI5 chiefNew legal battle at Wentworth as ex-CEO sues club after Chinese owner\u0026#39s daughter gets his jobJames and Charlotte are the most popular baby names for  readers over last 50 yearsFive killed in Louisiana plane crashBritish teenager accused of Ayia Napa gang rape fabrication suffered \u0026#39clear breach of fair trial rights\u0026#39, lawyer claims Heads of MI5 and MI6 expected to stand down in 2020 despite \u0026#39dangerous times\u0026#39 for BritainFather shot on doorstep in Battersea may have been target in mob revenge hitRobbie Williams backs friend\u0026#39s call for social media firms to stop online bullyingTake a DNA test to check Alzheimer\u0026#39s risk, urges businessman who lost both parents to the diseaseComment: My Christmas showed me how much smartphones have become our mastersIvor the Engine could be back on the tracks as creator\u0026#39s son reveals film plans Mother who lost husband and two children in Costa del Sol pool tragedy in row with police Death of Euromillions winner expected to set in motion Scotland\u0026#39s biggest inheritance case as future of his football club remains uncertainTrump under fire for retweeting name of Ukraine whistleblowerThree of Abu Hamza\u0026#39s sons arrested on suspicion of £1million scam with the \u0026#39help of a bank worker\u0026#39Tobias Ellwood urges Boris Johnson to hold off granting Huawei further access to the UK’s 5G networkComment: One Nation Toryism rests on patriotism, a concept the Left struggles to understandKate comes into her own: How the Duchess of Cambridge took centre stage while Team Sussex were awayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/27/15/artificial-intelligence-china-baidu-google.jpg","title":"ai china baidu artificial intelligence google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Artificial intelligence competition previously dominated by US tech giantsChinese technology giant\u0026nbspBaidu\u0026nbsphas overtaken\u0026nbspGoogle\u0026nbspand Microsoft in an\u0026nbspartificial intelligence\u0026nbspcompetition designed to test how well a machine can understand human language.Baidu, which is often referred to as\u0026nbspChina‘s Google, achieved the highest ever score in the General Language Understanding Evaluation (Glue) – widely considered to be the benchmark for\u0026nbspAI\u0026nbsplanguage understanding.The firm’s Ernie (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration) model became the first to score above 90 on the test, topping a\u0026nbspleaderboard\u0026nbspdominated by US tech firms and universities.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe feat also makes it one of only 10 AI systems to surpass the average human score of 87.1 on the GLUE benchmark.Ernie used a similar method to Google’s Bert (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which transformed natural-language understanding for AI when it was created last year.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM740 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1840 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken.

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM740 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1840 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken.

No other film has reflected society in the 21st century more succinctly. AWA magical reprieve from much of the queer romance canon,Barry Jenkins is destined to be one of the most important cinematicCLIt could start within a year, said Stephan Beringer, chief executive of Mirriad, a virtual product placement company that has worked brands including Pepsi, Geico and Sherwin-Williams into ABC’s Modern Family,\u0026nbspCBS’ How I Met Your Mother\u0026nbspand the Univision program El Dragon.Streaming services are more likely than traditional TV companies to pull off this specially targeted version of product placement because they have direct access to far more information on their customers. With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display. Roku, which spent $150m\u0026nbsp(£115m) this fall buying software provider Dataxu to help companies plan and buy ad campaigns, then shares insights about the audience with the company behind the ad.Created with Sketch.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving.

(RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell?

This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)“It is a different climate. But we have to remain true to the characters, to who they were,” Jones told The Sun.“Characters in Gavin \u0026amp Stacey are kind and big-hearted, I believe. So I think no one is going to be intentionally hurtful. But by the same token, they’re not necessarily going to be completely politically correct or be aware of political correctness.”Rob Brydon: ‘James Corden lost his way for a bit. I felt for him’The BBC has also now responded in a statement that reads: “\u0027Fairytale of New York’ is a very popular, much-loved Christmas song played widely throughout the festive season, and the lyrics are well established with the audience.”The anticipated return of the popular sitcom marked the best Christmas Day viewing figures for more than a decade.\u0026nbspThe Christmas episode, which was broadcast on BBC, was watched by an average of 11.6 million people, making it the biggest Christmas special since 2008.Read our review here.Gavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspFairytale of New York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a Facebook post on a fansite for the popular BBC sitcom, they pointed out that Nessa actually reveals the age difference between her and Stacey (Joanna Page).\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“This means that she is 18 years older than Stacey when the show first started, it says that both Gavin and Stacey are 26, meaning Nessa was 44 at the start.\u0026nbsp“Add 10 years onto that, and now she’s 54, meaning she’s around the same age as Bryn.\u0026nbspPlease correct me if I’m wrong, I’m just using the information I’ve got from the show and behind the scenes.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 30 best TV shows of the decade Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour.

Mr Coban founded charity My Life My Say, which aims to make democracy accessible for young people.He said: “My parents always instilled into us to give something back to our community, so for one of their children to receive an MBE for the work he has done with his community – that will be huge.”Some well-known civil society figures have also been given top honours, including damehoods for Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizen’s Advice, and Julia Unwin, the former chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. There is also a CBE for Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter.Stokes’ golden year ends with OBE honourGoldsmith gets peerage so he can stay as minister despite losing seatIain Duncan Smith knighted despite fury at Tory welfare policiesIn politics, Tory MP Bob Neill receives a knighthood along with his party’s controversial former leader, while Labour MP Diane Johnson – who worked on the campaign for a public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal – receives a\u0026nbspdamehood.Meanwhile\u0026nbspin sport, several members of the England cricket team and coaching staff have been recognised in the honours list following their ICC\u0026nbspWorld Cup triumph.

Some 11 per cent of recipients consider themselves to have a disability: the highest proportion for this category since numbers on disability started to be reported in 2016.Yet only 9.1 per cent of recipients come from a Bame (black, Asian and minority ethnic) background, down from 12 per cent compared to last year, and 3.3 per cent of recipients identified as being LGBT+, down from 5 per cent in the 2019 list.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But as other online platforms restricted their political ad inventory, advertisers were on the hunt for new options.”The new policy will cover US political groups such as candidates for office, elected officials, political parties, political action committees (PACs) and SuperPACS, as well as content that advocates for or against those groups.Spotify will no longer sell ads pushing for changes in legislation and judicial outcomes.The move only applies to Spotify’s ad sales, not advertisements embedded in third-party content, though those will still be subject to Spotify’s broader content policies.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border.

I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade.

I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so.

He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Universal Credit claimants could have Christmas benefits slashed  bosses pay wages early this month.Meanwhile, a five-week wait for Universal credit payouts has pushed a young family into debt and forced them to rely on handouts.And with changes coming into force in  around how Universal Credit works - find out how they will affect your payments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be. The Andrew scandal is far from over and  could be a pivotal year for the Duke, who has yet to face the FBI.So when you watch the Queen give her Christmas message tomorrow afternoon, spare a thought for someone who has served this country so dutully and for so long.An amazing woman of true decency and honour.We remain lucky to have her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Reduce immigration. I mean really reduce it. To something like nine people per year. I get to choose who the nine are. Most of them will be from Hong Kong. Don’t underestimate the strength of feeling against unlimited immigration, BoJo. Andyou reduce immigration you won’t need to pave over half of our remaining countryside to build new houses.

How low-carbon can you go  Reduce meat and dairy consumption, as beef and sheep livestock have a high carbon footprint. If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers. Buy strawberries, for example, from Norfolk, not Morocco.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest. Christmas truce will not last long.THE anti-democratic effort to block Brexit cost time, but it also cost money.Fine, ious big businesses might prefer we had voted Remain.But we didn’t.After the referendum, the private sector stood ready to do what it does best: Adapt and get on with le.But what businesses really dislike is not change so much as uncertainty.And Parliament made uncertainty an art form in the past three years.Now that we’ve got a new deal, a new Commons and a new Government, we should see new investment unlocked.Including money and decisions which were shelved during all the political hurly-burly.Let’s get Brexit done, and get Britain booming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

James Blunt continued putting out brilliant, self-effacing tweets, and Julian Richer of Richer Sounds handed control of his company to his staff as he turned , giving them % of his shares and proving you don’t have to be a greedy b*****d to be successful at making money.  But no one was cooler or braver than Stormzy, who became the first black solo British artist to headline Glastonbury, wearing a Banksy-created stab-proof vest emblazoned with the Union Jack, and who called out Boris Johnson all year for fuelling racism in Britain. BEST WOMAN Baroness Warsi called out the Tory Islamaphobes but no one heard her as they were too busy worrying about Labour’s race problems. Meanwhile, Miriam Margolyes spoke for the nation by telling Australian TV that former Tory PM David Cameron should be “boiled in oil”.  Phoebe Waller-Bridge deserves a mention for everything she wrote, and Keeley Hawes for every role she took on. However, runner-up is American footballer Megan Rapinoe, who, when hearing President Trump wanted to press the flesh of the World Cup winners said, “I’m not going to the f***ing White House.”  And the winner had to be Greta Thunberg, for giving Trump THAT stare, and winding-up all sanctimonious, middle-aged male bores on this dying planet.

Gripes include undercooked bacon and too few rashers in sarnies, soggy jam roly-poly and eggs taking too long to fry. And a veggie Christmas sarnie was deemed too expensive at £.. The complaints, published by the House of Commons under transparency rules, emerged as taxpayer-funded subsidies for bars and canteens hit £.million last year. The contribution was up from £.million in . And the list of gripes, covering the  months to summer , sparked a call for Westminster to “appreciate” its perk and its hard-pressed caterers. One person mithering about soggy jam roly-poly sent in photos of a “properly cooked” example. Another grumbled about coffee and muffins, writing: “Please make sure your baristas can pour a flat white, my previous   orders were signicantly below the standard I have come to expect. Muffins, colleagues are concerned about selection.” One diner unimpressed by their sausage sarnie said: “The way it is done is not good. I had to butter the bread, get the sausages cut in half then put them on the bread.” Another disagreed with “proper English mustard” being replaced “with a disgusting ‘mild’ mustard”. And one user moaned: “Is there any prospect of you ing to cooking the bacon properly instead of waving it briefly over the griddle ” Other beefs included salty shepherd’s pie and coffee being from a machine. One diner would prefer mince to steak in their Mexican quesadilla, while a lasagne was a touch dry.  One diner blasted the “pathetic offerings of haggis, neeps and tatties”, saying: “I was given portions which filled % of the packaging. “The point is it is a filling Scottish dish of veg and meat-oatmeal, meant to be plentul. By giving miserly portions, you fail to understand its background, its roots.” And another diner said: “A bit of unnecessary sexism: ‘shepherdess pie’, Quorn topped with mash. ‘Quorn shepherd’s pie’ would have been clearer. There’s nothing inherently female about a veggie option.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sara wallis return bbc 1s","story":"NewsopinionSara Wallis: Return of BBC s Worzel Gummidge with Mackenzie Crook is a winnerOnce viewers get used to Worzel Gummidge, a scarecrow with a turnip-headed face and spidery root fingers, the show isnt creepy anymore and will have your family belly-laughing in delightShareCommentsBySara Wallis:,  DEC Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv video the-bbc-classic-worzel-gummidge-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news sara-wallis--bbc-s-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mackenzie, star of The Office and Pirates of the Caribbean, wrote and ­directed the films and spent three hours in make-up every day for the role. And the cast was top notch. We had Michael Palin as the Green Man, creator of the ­scarecrows, Zoe Wanamaker as an ­eccentric local aristocrat and Steve Pemberton and Rosie Cavaliero as farmers Mr and Mrs Braithwaite. All of them scene stealers. Newbies India Brown and Thierry Wickens as city foster “chillun” Susan and John also held their own. Then there was the eco message about saving the planet – Worzel’s own gentle Extinction Rebellion,you will. Worzel is worried about the weather –the crops are late, the birds won’t fly the nest, something is wrong. We see them litter picking and Worzel’s arch-enemies the crows agree to remove harmful plastic bags that had caught on branches. They carefully put them in a recycling bin, one assumes the correct one. The humour is sharp throughout. I dare anyone not to be tickled by Worzel ­downing a glass of milk that gushes straight out of his trouser leg on account of his not having insides. At the end there was a nice speech that gave me all the feels without being preachy. “I’m worried, sir,” Worzel says to the Green Man.  “I’m worried about the ­weather and the seasons and all the plastic everywhere. I’m worried about the hedges and the ditches and the bees and the flowers. They’re all having a tough time of it, sir.” “You think two children can turn it \u2028all around ” "},{"url":null,"title":"anthony knott new cctv footage","story":"NewsAnthony Knott: New CCTV footage released of missing firefighter around time he vanishedSussex Police are hoping that the grainy new footage will help with inquiries into the disappearance of Anthony who went missing in Lewes, on Friday, December ShareCommentsByAmber HicksNeil Murphy:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video police-release-cctv-missing-firefighter-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news anthony-knott-new-cctv-footage-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Sussex Police have released new surveillance footage showing Anthony walking on the opposite side of the road in the hope it will help with enquiries.A police statement on Facebook read: A man believed to be Anthony was captured on the opposite side of the road from the Elephant and Castle at .pm on Friday  December. He was walking away from the town towards Offham Road, but at .pm walked back into town towards Market Street where he was seen walking at .pm.It’s not very clear, but he has distinctive walk and we’re hoping that someone who was in the area at the time may have seen him.  The new video comes after investigators released an image of his last known sighting before he went missing during a Christmas pub crawl with workmates.The black and white CCTV still shows the dad-of-four walking outside while dressed in a jumper, jeans and dark jacket. Anthony was with a group of friends at The Lamb pub in Fisher Street, Lewes, when he left alone about .pm. His family confirmed a sighting of him walking up Market Street – back towards The Lamb – at .pm. It is  minutes after his phone was switched off, according to the time captured on the CCTV image, but still provides no clues as to his current whereabouts. Specialist teams have carried out extensive searches of the area surrounding the pub and the Pells Pool area, which has been severely affected by flood water over the past few days.  Bins, alleyways and aposdark areasapos have also been searched, but so far there has been no trace of family man Anthony.His distraught fiancee, Lucy Otto , is among the dozens searching for him.She made a direct plea to him and said: I’m coming to search for you again today, I won’t rest until I know what’s happened to you. Chief Inspector Sarah Godley, from Sussex Police, is urging anyone with information to come forward. “We have reviewed CCTV footage from a number of premises such as homes and businesses, and we are continuing to retrieve and review further footage as we attempt to find out what happened to Anthony, she said in a statement. We hope this latest image of him may jog someone’s memory or help provide some new information about his disappearance.  “Our searches have included local officers, drones and the dog unit, and we have also been assisted by London Fire Brigade, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, the National Police Air Service helicopter, Sussex Search and Rescue and the Coastguard agency in our quest to locate Anthony. “The area we have searched includes Pells Pool and Pellbrook Cut, as well as bins, street furniture, alleyways and dark areas. “In addition to the local area, we have also extended our search of the River Ouse north towards Hamsey, and we will continue to search for Anthony until we get the answers his family are so desperately seeking.

Christmas with your ex isn’t as weird as it sounds – I should know, I’ve just done it.  This year, Ray came over on Christmas Eve and spent Christmas Day with me and the three kids. We had the best time. Because it’s sad when you’ve spent so much of your le with someone and all you can focus on is the bad stuff. I’ll admit, Ray and I had a hard three or four years at the end of our relationship. But we had  fantastic years together and we have a beautul daughter. And now we get on better than we ever did.  The kids didn’t need to spend half a day with me and then half a day with him. But I was glad – and it’s a joint feeling – that he was leaving after two days! I would encourage couples to rise above the other rubbish and give it a try. Obviously,it’s been an abusive relationship it’s never going to work and you should not even consider it. Butit’s just a case of the marriage coming to a natural end, then why not be friends  Before Christmas, Ciara and I went to New York and Ray came over and looked after the house and pets. We have family parties and no one is left feeling awkward, either. We are both dead happy now so there’s no point in being bitter or stuck in the past. And I’m equally as good friends with my ex, Shane. Le is too short.  The last two years have been hard and me and Ray weren’t getting on. It was really dficult so I’m happy we’ve got our friendship back. This Christmas was amazing. Ciara made us all Christmas Eve boxes, which we opened together and Ray stayed over… in the spare room, of course. In the boxes were pyjamas and face masks so we all put them on. She got him Grinch ones as we used to always call him the Grinch at Christmas. We got up in the morning and did the presents, then I did a Full English for everyone before the turkey dinner with all the trimmings.

The coupleaposs world was rocked when the dad-of-five was diagnosed him with incurable cancer.It spurred on the pair to finally get hitched - and the day was exactly as they had hoped, reports Derbyshire Live. Kirsty said: All Garry wanted was to get married and it is all I wanted too. The couple, who live in Winshill, were left living in a weird bubble following the diagnosis. Garry had been vomiting and suffering with a runny nose. When his symptoms got worse, he went to the doctors and was told he had a tumour in his oesophagus which has spread to his liver.

Bath resident Jo Macphersonaposs excitement at eating at The Bathampton Mill on Christmas Day soon turned to dismay. She claims her partner Simon Wright, , his mum Beryl Wright, , and his daughter Harriet Wright, eight, were booked in for .pm but had to wait an hour before their first course arrived on Christmas day. Jo, , claimed the service and kitchen staff were arguing with one another, one waitress was aposvery rudeapos to them and they were so fed up that they left at .pm. Bathampton Mill has apologised to the family over their experience and said they gave them a full refund, Somerset Live reports.  But she told of how unimpressed the family was after looking forward to their Christmas meal. Instead of enjoying a five-course meal together at the restaurant, they found themselves back at Mr Wrightaposs home thoroughly dejected, and sharing a meal of frozen pizza, cheese and crackers, as that was the only food left. Jo said: It was nothing short of a disaster due to lack of staff and organisation. It also seemed the service staff were arguing with the kitchen staff. I was told by the waitress, who was actually very rude, when we complained about poor slow service, menu changes and a cancelled amuse-bouche. She stated that she was not happy either as she could be at home with her family enjoying Xmas. She obviously didn’t want to work on Christmas day.This was not an isolated incident.  Other guests arriving for the .pm sitting were also complaining, some worse off than us, waiting up to  minutesfor their table which should have been available from .pm. We were the first to complain and demand a refund , which we received without hesitation. I feel they were happy to see us leave as we started other complaints demanding full refunds, from more polite guests.I went home to a meal of cheese and crackers and a frozen pizza. Not what I’d expect on Christmas Day. It was the worst Christmas I’ve ever had!I was a regular visitor but the service has always been poor with staff shortages. I assumed this would not happen on Christmas day. I was very wrong. Jo vows she will neverthere after this experience.  She said: It is such a shame because we have been regulars. We used to go twice a month, she said. We recommended this place to lots of people but now we feel stupid. It ruined our Christmas Day. When we got there, they were clearly short-staffed and those that were there were very stressed. The manager wasnapost visible at all. There was a queue of people waiting for ages. We had to wait  minutes for a bottle of wine. We eventually got it after I went up to the bar to get it. We waited an hour for our first course, one of which was a course we did not order. At .pm we had had enough. My partner wanted his money back. He was polite, quite forceful but not rude. Everyone was watching and looking at us. Jo was surprised they received a refund after the dire experience they said they endured. For the price we paid, you expect good treatment, she said. We asked for the refund and we got it. I was a little surprised that we did. When we went up and complained people were applauding us for doing it. Some said aposwell doneapos to him. We will never go back there. It is such a shame because it is a lovely spot in a beautul place and it has a lot of potential. It needs to be managed properly and they need more staff. To come home to some frozen pizza, cheese and crackers was a real let down. We had purposefully not bought much because we had the dinner to look forward to, so that is all we had left. But tonight we are using the refunded money to have a meal with all of us at the Aqua restaurant in Bath, so that should be good. I just hope others donapost have the same bad experience as we had.

Peter Beaumont arrived at the Wagon and Horses pub in Gloucester on Wednesday with his dad and partner hoping for a quality roast dinner. The former Channel Tunnel chef and Gloucestershire Regiment corporal, who likes to think he knows what makes a good meal, says that dinner he received ruined Christmas. Mitchells  Butlers, the firm which owns the pub, has since apologised and contacted Peter directly - something he disputes, Gloucestershire Live reported. The troubled visit got off to a bad start when the party say they arrived to be told they have only booked a table for two, not three. Have you had a Christmas disaster  Email webnews@mirror    Following an uncomfortable discussion, the group was led to their table where they say they did not receive their complimentary glass of Bucks Fizz, as advertised when they stumped up £. for the pre-paid meal. While they waited for a third place at the table to be set, the trio say they sweltered in extremely hot heat caused by the boiling radiators. We sat and sweat for a while, said the army veteran, whose request to open a window was refused. As they waited for their food and became increasingly warm the family looked at their surroundings. I noticed gravy splashes on the light fitments above our table and cobwebs dangling from the ceiling, Peter said.  When the starter arrived they say it was tepid and lacking sour cream or garlic croutons. The baguette portion that accompanied it was a mere three inches of crusty stick-end. It was the main course that really got Peter fuming however. He said: We did not get a jug of gravy as per the menu. The turkey was moist and fairly warm the sprouts were under cooked and quite hard and tepid.  The carrots were un-peeled or scraped and were not even topped and tailed, and also very under cooked and hard. The broccoli was edible - just - but tepid. The roast parsnips were under cooked. The embarrassing roast potatoes were tiny, mushy and boiled in oil, and certainly not like a roast potato.  The stuffing ball were the tiniest things, about the size of a marble and just as hard. My pig in a blanket was disappointing, the blanket was thread bare. Despite having asked at the beginning of the meal, the Bucks Fizz only arrived halfway through the main course, they claim. The Christmas pudding dessert was also deemed not up to scratch and was doused in tepid brandy sauce. Mr Beaumont said his request for a refund was rejected.  He was not pleased with the customer service and claims staff did not respond to his complaints on the day or since. He said: Christmas Day was a ruined event because of the dinner.

The royals were snubbed when their team approached the Deep Cove Chalet, an upscale eatery in North Saanich, Vancouver Island, to make reservations for dinner. The seafood eatery, run by husband and we Bev and Pierre Koffel, was scouted by Meghan and Harry’s security for a potential dining spot. But the owners say they had to turn the couple’s request down due to the high security that would be required. The Sussexes have broken with tradition this year and are enjoying a Christmas break with Meghan Markleaposs mum in Canada rather than staying in the UK.Bev told local paper Vancouver Sun: “They said ‘How did you figure out who we were ’ And I said ‘It wasn’t too hard’.” She said her husband was the one who answered the phone when the royals wanted to make a reservation, and turned them down due to the security required. She said to the local paper: “You know what Pierre’s like. We’ll see what happens.” Mrs Koffel said she wanted the Sussexes to have the best time possible and also privacy as they celebrate their first Christmas with baby Archie.  She said: “They jog around, so they’ve been seen. It’s kind of exciting. I hope everything goes fine for them. “They’re breaking away from tradition and I just wish them all the best.” “Let them have their peace and quiet. For us to be so lucky to have them in the area, how lucky is that  “I wish them all the privacy they can possibly get. They deserve it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles aide who played","story":"NewsMeghan Markles aide who played key role in Royal Wedding is honoured by QueenClara Loughran, who is the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs senior programme coordinator, has been awarded a Member of the Royal Victorian Order by Her Majesty the QueenShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video meghan-markle-releases-sweetest-christmas-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markles-aide-who-played-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Her devoted fans are know as the Hinch Army and sheaposs had such an impact cleaning your home is now often referred to as aposhinchingapos. Mrs Hinch keeps all her cleaning products, including her beloved Minkys, in a cupboard she dubs Narnia . She started to clean as a wayof helping her overcome her battle with anxiety. The busy mum now devotes at least  minutes of every day to keeping on top of her cleaning. But what are Mrs Hinchaposs tips for cleaning every room in your house, and which products do you need in your very own Narnia  Here, she reveals all. Kitchen  Weaposd all love to have a kitchen like Mrs Hinchaposs - itaposs absolutely immaculate. The worktops aare spotless, the floor gleams and the sink sparkles. So, how does she get it in such tip top shape  First, she starts with the sink. Mrs Hinch uses soda crystals in her plugs. She pours some down and then follows it with white vinegar. Once itaposs fizzed she makes the whole room smell amazing by pouring a capful of her favourite Zoflora and leaves for five minutes. Next, she pours a kettle full of boiling water down the sink to get rid of the soda crystals. To achieve the amazing sparkle on her sink Mrs Hinch uses her go-to favourite, Pink Stuff, wiping it all over the sink and then wiping it away.  She then uses a pine disinfectant and wipes the whole sink with her Minky - a must-have for any member of the Hinch Army. And to get that all important shine, Mrs Hinch then uses C Stainless Steel, sprays it on, leaves it for  minutes and then she wipes it off with Buddy, her name for the Spontext Microfibre Kitchen cloths. Next, she tackles the floor. Using her trusty Vera , she uses diluted Zoflora mix to mop floors. This works on laminate or or tiles and the instructions of how to make up the diluted mix are on the box. For a deep clean, Mrs Hinch mops with Trace . She vaccums up all the crumbs on her work tops, getting right into the corners, and makes sure she shakes her toaster to remove all the bits of bread.  Mrs Hinch uses a Zoflora mix, which she puts in a spray and works across her work tops, using a Pinky to clean away any mess. She makes sure she does this every night before she goes to bed. On her halogen hob and glass oven door, Mrs Hinch uses her Kermit, a Minky M Cloth, and some white vinegar. She wipes plugs and light switches down with C Power and Shine wipes. And how to get the bottom of your frying pans super clean, Mrs Hinch style - she uses Fairy Power Spray, which she leaves on for three minutes and then and scrubs away. For a basic oven clean, take the racks out and soak them in washing up liquid and warm water. Then roughly wipe them down with C Power and Shine. Put a tea towel on the floor and open the oven. Using a generous dollop of Pink Stuff on your Minky, which youaposve dipped in a glass of warm water and washing up liquid. Wipe the oven to remove crumbs from the door and then rub the Pink Stuff in with Minky. Do the same to the inside of the oven and leave it for five minutes.  Go back to the racks and use Minky to rub excess Pink Stuff into them then leave. With Minky still a bit damp rub it all into the racks, squeeze it out and rub it in again with a little water. Rinse out Minky and use other side to get rid of all the Pink Stuff. Rinse Minky again with no bubbles and use it to finish wiping the oven. Then dry with kitchen roll and make sure you all the seals are completely dry. Then spray your oven door with pine disinfectant to clean the outside and rub in with Minky. Use a white vinegar spray to clean the glass and rub it all in with Minky. Get rid of the bubbles in the sink and rinse racks. Use an oven liner in the bottom of the oven to catch the dirt and wipe down with a damp Minky onboth sides and then leave to air dry. Put everything back in.

And then comes the toilet, using Harpic bleach, make sure you get the nozzle of the bottle right on the rim of the seat. Wipe the whole toilet, starting with the lid, moving onto the body and then the seat, with C Power and Shine wipes.  Pour Flash Bathroom into the sink and use your Minky to wipe it down. Next, pour Flash into the bath and rinse with water from the tap. Them spray the shower and taps with Viakal and leave for no longer than five minutes.

The Duchess of Sussex’s mum Doria, , is joining the royal trio – along with a royal protection team, who are staying in a cottage in the grounds. The property is believed to be owned by a powerful Russian businessman who is so secretive that he insisted the estate agent handling his purchase sign a non-disclosure agreement. And it has everything a modern royal could desire – the gourmet kitchen is fitted with a top-of-the-range pizza oven, perfect for Harry, who has spoken of his love for a deep dish and thin crust. One local, who runs a deli close to the sprawling home in British Columbia, told the Sunday Mirror: “We know that it’s owned by a Russian businessman, but he’s never around.” Another told us: “It’s an incredible property, and one of the most prestigious around here. “I wasn’t surprised when I found out Harry and Meghan are staying there. It’s certainly fit for royalty.” The Sunday Mirror has decided not to reveal the location of the royal couple’s holiday home. Built just over a decade ago in several acres of manicured grounds, the estate was described by one previous visitor as “a sanctuary” rather than simply a home. The rooms of the main house alone cover more than , sq ft – almost half as big again as Love Island’s summer complex on Majorca. As well as a wealth of opulent bedrooms, multiple bathrooms and a formal dining room, it has a games room with wet bar, a media room and even a wine-tasting room. The two-storey living room has spectacular sunset views looking across a magnicent stretch of water. And despite being relatively new, there is even a th century French fireplace imported specially from Europe. The guest cottage in the grounds adds more than , sq ft of indoor space, and there is also a luxury summer house. The Duke and Duchess, celebrating seven-month-old Archie’s first Christmas, are understood to have arrived at the property  days ago and are expected to stay until Friday.The region on Canada’s west coast was a favourite of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, who admired its rugged beauty. But despite their luxury accommodation, Harry, , and Meghan, , ate out on Christmas Day – taking a private suite at a nearby VIP resort, with caterers they hired just for the day. An insider at the upmarket retreat, where the eco-conscious couple were seen arriving in a parade of xs, said: “The high-end caterers were called in to supply the lunch, which included vegetarian options, right at the last minute. “There were  to  people in the suite, including their security detail. A fleet of SUVs was outside the resort, which the group had used, including Range Rovers.  “And as well as security from England, there were also members of the Royal ­Canadian Mounted Police there too.” The couple’s British security detail for the trip is paid for by the taxpayer. The source revealed that, during the lunch, talk had turned to how the group should go for afternoon tea at a hotel once visited by both Harry’s father, Prince Charles, and his grandmother, the Queen. The source added: “Harry and Meghan laughed about it. They wanted to go there, but it was thought to be too public at this time of year.” The couple had needed to change their Christmas Day plans at short notice after another restaurant turned down their reservation due to the tight security required.  And while Prince William, Kate and their eldest children George, six, and Charlotte, four, greeted crowds at Sandringham on Christmas Day along with other Royals, Harry and Meghan were instead spotted taking Archie for a quiet family stroll in nearby parkland. A dog walker who passed them said: “I saw them on one of the trails. They were with three security men. I saw the security men first – I just thought to myself how unusual it was.” It is unclear who footed the bill for the Christmas Day lunch, or who is paying for the couple’s luxury stay – estimated to cost as much as £, a month.

When we flush the toilet, have a shower or use the washing machine the contents simply disappear - and itaposs easy to just forget about it. But the waste has to go somewhere- which means itaposs someoneaposs job to take care of your business. And then there is the smell.The staff at Severn Trentaposs sewage works, gave a Leicestershire Live reporting crew a tour of the site to demysty the question of where our everyday waste ends up - and who has to deal with it.At the Wanlip Water Treatment Works, site and sewage treatment veteran Dylan Thorley led a tour of the works, offering up his two decades of insight into the industry. Surprisingly the smell only reached us as we passed the point that sewage first enters the site, apart from that the air smelled the same as anywhere not a little eggy. He carries around a gas protector with him, warning that it goes off and he starts running- then we should too. With that in mind, we ventured to our first stop: the preliminary stage of the fascinating sewage treatment process. Workers have found wedding rings, wallets and moneyThis is the point where the sewage from the Rothley line and the  Leicester City  line first enters the site.Here, the smell is horrendous, after all it is , litres of raw sewage making its way into the plant every second. There was nothing comparable to the stench. Mr Thorley, however, didnapost flinch and claimed that the  years of being in the business had hardened him to the smell and he just didnapost notice it that much anymore. The sewage is not just made up of human excrement as many might think, indeed a lot of it comes from showers, washing machines and rain, grey water as Mr Thorley described it. At this stage aposragapos is separated from the water by four conveyor belts. The aposragapos made up of things like toilet paper and large objects thrown up by the sewage line is then compacted and pushed out of pipes resembling huge cigars. When the aposragapos reaches the end of the pipe it drops off just like ash from a burning cigar.  Left on the floor is essentially a pile of steaming toilet paper amongst lots of other solid debris removed from the sewage - Mr Thorley said that one of his workers once found £ in notes at this stage whilst on sht. Workers have also found wedding rings, wallets and driving licences that have made their way to the works. Rag is one of our biggest problems, not everything can be flushed, or put down the sink, he explained. Andanything happens to our machines or blocks the network we have to get in their and clean it out, itaposs not the nicest thing. The rag is collected in skips and taken off to landfill, another reason why people should use biodegradable products added Mr Thorley.  Mounds of sweetcorn and grit Next, but still part of the preliminary stage, finer solids that have escaped the first part are picked up. Again, this is to remove things that could potentially cause machinery to clog up or mal but also to remove solids from the water. Amongst the debris are all kinds of grit which is extracted and piled into mounds before itaposs recycled to be used in the making roads, for example. Looking at these mounds the first thing you notice are little yellow dots amongst the mostly black grit. What are they  Sweet corn, thousands of little kernels which cannot be broken down by the human body during the digestion phase. After the mounds of sweet corn and grit are removed the water moves on to giant rectangular pools called primary settling tanks.  aposI put all my cooking waste in a jarapos Looking into these pools you can still see some of the fat and impurities within the water. This is a big issue says Mr Thorley, because like aposragapos the machinery can be clogged up by grease and fat. I put all my cooking waste in a jar and wait for it to go hard, then I bin it. I donapost want to block my sewer up or the networks with fat traps, and at this time of the year the temperature is cooler so everything solidies quicker he said. This stage is also where apossludgeapos is removed using scrapers which move along the bottom of the pool. That sludge is then carried to the end of the tank where pumps extract it and send it onwards to the sludge treatment process. The liquid left behind, goes over the edge of the pool and onto the secondary stage.  The second process the sewage goes through is equally as important. Up until this point there had been a particularly unpleasant smell. As we walk up to the third stage in the process you can here a whirring of machinery. The pools here were built in  and are due for refurbishment, said Mr Thorley. No smell at all This stage is certainly the most spectacular, and itaposs important to note that none of the sewage has been touched by a single chemical by this point.  Itaposs known as an activated sludge plant and Mr Thorley said that itaposs at this stage that aposbugsapos are introduced which then feed on harmful bacteria within the water. The whirring that could be heard on approach was in fact multiple spinning metal stirrers which theatrically blend the brown and murky water with oxygen, creating a kind of tidal wave effect as it thrashes around. This process helps introduce oxygen into the water which in turn creates a healthy environment for the bugs to survive. And as we walked along the metal bridge over the whirlpool of sewage, careful not to get a splash of brown liquid to the face, there was no particular smell at all. In fact it smelled of nothing. After the bugs have worked their magic the water moves on to one of  circular shaped pools.  These pools are the final stage and are where the water that is left moves on to the river Soar, which is just behind the facility. Water is transparent When you compare the colour, smell and just complete repulsiveness of the raw sewage when it first enters the site to the water that is discharged into the river, itaposs worlds apart. Here, a small stream runs from the site towards the River Soar. Mr Thorley stands over it with a metal bucket.  Lowering it into the running water he pulls it up by a chain and pours it back. The water is transparent and looks like any water that you would see coming from a tap, although he suggested you would probably be best not to drink it. You would never believe that this water started off as raw sewage just a couple hundred metres away. In fact, Severn Trent maintain that the water that goes into the river is of better quality than what is already there. As mentioned in then primary stage, sludge is redirected towards sludge treatment plants.  These are huge drum like structures that store the sludge at C - the same temperature as a human stomach. This aids with the production of methane, which is then turned into energy that fuels four massive engines. aposSomeone has to do itapos Mr Thorley said that the whole facility uses about £, worth of electricity a month and these engines help to keep the facility somewhat self-sufficient. Severn Trent have also made a triple carbon pledge, which means that they hope to achieve zero emissions,  per cent renewable power and an all-electric fleet of vehicles by .

But thanks to the incredible CLIC Sargent Homes From Home, -year-old Jake was able to open his gts and eat a family dinner on December  last year surrounded by his nearest and dearest. And all despite being on an isolation ward more than  miles from home. Jake’s mum, Kathryn, told us: “Cancer crushes a family in a way you only understandyou’ve lived it. Without a Home From Home just minutes from Jake’s bedside, I don’t know how we’d have coped. “Christmas was kept special… we will be eternally grateful.” Diagnosed with leukaemia in  aged just , Jake relapsed in August last year and needed a le-saving stem cell transplant. His younger brother Daniel was a perfect match – but the intensive radiotherapy, transplant and recovery process gave no hope of Christmas at home. Living at Holywell Bay, Cornwall, they were a six-hour round trip from Bristol Children’s Hospital. Kathryn, , said: “We simply couldn’t have afforded to rent a flat in Bristol for the five months we needed to be there. “Anyway, the family room we had at CLIC House was so much more than basic accommodation. The facilities were impeccable, with communal areas to share stories with other families.  “And it was just a stone’s throw from the hospital. We even had a big Christmas party there, with presents put under the tree for all of us. The thought and care we got were simply incredible.”Jake had his transplant on December , and had to stay in isolation for weeks afterwards because his immune system was so low. Kathryn and her parents had Christmas dinner in the room with him, with Father Christmas walking past outside and carols being sung.Kathryn said: “Jake’s treatment meant he felt terrible. For us to be so close by meant what would have been a stressful time was actually rather special. “As a parent you want to be strong for your child. If you’re tired or too immersed in it, you simply can’t do that.  We also met other families with children going through similar journeys, and sharing stories really helped us all cope.” This Christmas the family celebrated at home. Kathryn said: “We all raised a glass to CLIC Sargent during dinner, to all those other families going through what we did last year. “We urge Sunday Mirror readers to dig deep to help.

Tanya Barad when she was diagnosed with Endometriosis at the age of . A decade on, the -year-old from Solihull has been through three painful surgeries and has been told she has only a   chance of conceiving. She is now desperately fundraising for the new oy freezing treatment she has been told could give her a chance at having a baby in future. The endometriosis awareness campaigner is also opening up about her personal health battle to raise funds in hopes of helping other women who suffer from the agonising condition.Tanya told Birmingham Live she apospretty much just assumed as a child that I would grow up and have kidsapos but now faces the chance of never having the future sheaposs always wanted.She has had three surgeries to remove the painful endometrial tissuethat has been growing in other places around her body but there is no NHS funding for surgery that could potentially help her have a baby.  She said:Endometriosis  is something which impacts every part of your le. It effects how much energy you have, which then effects what kind of job you can have.It affects your relationships, not just with your boyfriend but with your friends because you canapost go out a lot of the time because youaposre not well. It can affect your finance, pretty muchthereaposs anything it can affect it, will affect it. I found out that I had a   chance of having kids when I was  and for the last  years I have had a constant state of worry and depression around the fact that I may never be able to have children. I have looked into having some sort of fertility procedure before, the main one was looking at egg freezing but it ended up being quite a large procedure that would interact with the medication Iaposm on currently. The oy freezing is a new type of surgery that has now become available to endometriosis patients at Birmingham Womenaposs Hospital. Unfortunately, the NHS wonapost pay for this for endometriosis patients. I will be using this treatment for fertility treatment so thatin a few years time I have not been able to conceive naturally, they will be able to put younger eggs back into my body.  The other good thing about this treatment is that I can use it as a treatment for endometriosis so when I go into menopause I can have a natural version of hormone replacement therapy by using the oies of my current age as a treatment for the future. Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. It is a relatively common condition, primarily affecting girls and women of childbearing age. It is less common among women who have been through menopause. It can cause painful or heavy periods, and may also lead to infertility, fatigue and bowel and bladder problems.Approximately . million women in Britain live with endometriosis. While it is a long-term condition, for which there is no cure, treatments to ease symptoms are available. More information from the NHS is available here The potentially childless future for Tanya has taken itaposs toll on her mental health which has begun to affect work.Tanya raises awareness for her condition and was featured as one of Birminghamaposs  under   this year.My mental health goes up and down, Iaposve had some really bad depression and was on anti depressants for a few years now which does help but it can be hard to keep optimistic, she told BirminghamLive. I usually do an annual charity ball to help raise awareness but I just had to cancel it cause Iaposm physically not well enough. There are two sides to my depression. One is just being in pain, is depressing, but the other is the constant worry I have had for  years that I may never be able to start a family. Thataposs where this surgery comes in, since itaposs been an option my mental health has been better about the future and itaposs been a massive relief.You can give to Tanyaaposs fertility fundraiser  here.Why does Tanya have to pay for her surgery  Tanya claims that her condition is not well supported and said that she had never been offered the surgery in the last  years sheaposs been diagnosed. Although, she has had three dferent surgeries to remove her endometriosis making this one her fourth in the last decade.She said: Living with endometriosis really sucks. This will be my  fourth surgery in the last decade  to remove endo and adhesions. I get good days and bad but it affects my job, energy, le and especially my relationship as being intimate can really hurt and that puts strain on a relationship. Iaposm back at the pain point now where Iaposm cautious about where I go out to, what I wear is dependant on swelling or pain and generally itaposs just impacting my whole le. Iaposve had  three laparoscopy excision surgeries so they remove any endo or adhesions they find. Her new surgery will give Tanya the chance to preserve part of her oy which will help her chances of fertility and ease menopause in the future. Tanya is now trying her best to raise funds for the cost of the treatment as her condition does not make her eligible for the treatment on the NHS. The NHS covers this aposfertility-savingapos surgery for cancer patients but not for Endometriosis. The oy preservation procedure costs around £, but Tanya is aiming to raise £, as she pledges to give additional funds to Endometriosis UK, a charity that have supported her through her journey and also support  million other women suffering from the condition across the UK.

He said he was nervous for me to open my gt because he hoped I liked it, I figured it would be really thoughtful. However, as I opened the gt I was kind of upset at how generally insensitive it seemed. It looked ashe had frantically put it together with not much regard to my actual interests likes. Being that weaposve been together for some time it should be pretty simple for him to pick out things he may think I like as I have a pretty wide iety of interests. The things I was most upset about though is the fact he got me cheap dish scrubbers and a few cooking utensils that we already have.  The woman continued that her partner never does the dishes and has only cooked for her maybe once in their entire relationship. She added: So, he asked meI liked my gt and I told him not really and asked why he thought dish scrubbers and other ious kitchen items were okay to gt me. He told me he figured they would help me cook clean, which really p***ed me off because there are so many things I actually need for our homeand he goes out and purchases me a bunch of insensitive junk. The woman went on to say her boyfriend has branded her unappreciative and rude. Hundreds have since rallied behind the girlfriend with one saying: Honestly I’m amazed you didn’t break up with him on the spot.  Another wrote: Please dump his ass. This IS insensitive and very inconsiderate. Relationships are supposed to be about respect and a lot of give and take. Not saying that every relationship is the same but just the fact that you make dinner as well as the washing up every single time is enough to show how he just takes you for granted. If communication doesnapost work, find someone who is willing to communicate and appreciates you. Another said: Throw the whole boyfriend out.

Police found the heads of two persons, as well as five bodies. The cause of death is under investigation. Officials could not immediately confirm whether the heads belonged to the five bodies or were from two other people. Investigators described the bodies inside the shipwreck as being partially skeletonised, indicating that they could have been at sea for a signicant period of time.  The wooden boat had letters and numbers written in Korean on its outside, reports Japanese broadcaster NHK .The bow measures about . meters long, . meters wide and two meters high.A police officer first spotted the wooden boat on Friday afternoon but waited until Saturday before entering it due to unstable weather .The discovery on Saturday marks the second time since last month that a wooden boat has washed up on the shores of Sado island.  Ghost boats from North Korea are a fairly common discovery on Japanese waters and are generally empty or contain only human remains. Exposure and starvation are the most likely explanations for deaths of crewmembers during winter months Some speculation has claimed that some on board ghost boats are defectors or spies from North Korean leader Kim Jong-unaposs repressive regime. Poverty and a lack of food is forcing North Koreans to fish further from home, putting them at risk of death.  The grisly find adds to the troubles that Japan and South Korea have with their neighbour North Korea. Ongoing tensions in Northaposs nuclear arms programme could make an investigation dficult to carry out. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has given the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions as talks between the two countries have broken down.

The schoolboy strongman from Shalya in Russia, has being going to the gym since he was five, when he started training with his dad Arseniy. The proud father said the youngster developed his passion after imitating people down the gym. He just played at first, then he jumped rope, took hoola hoop and ran with it, he said. Then we noticed that he started to take light dumbbells, repeated after me and [other] people, looked at how they did it, tried to raise their dumbbells. Timofey now wven takes part in deadlt competitions and is able to lt more than a lot of adults. He weighs .kg, and is able to lt kg. At first, relatives worried about the boy’s interest, but Timofey was adamant. Mother asked me: aposWhy do you need this, Timofey  You will have big problems when you grow upapos. I answered: aposI am fascinated with it and it’s the most important thing in my leapos he said. The boy’s father doesn’t think that the workouts will have an impact on Timofey’s health in the long run. Every three or four months we are followed up with by doctors and surgeons.

It was so loud.“We did sprints before going back in to get changed and the noise was unbelievable from the away fans.“Even when we were down in the second half they were still there in big numbers and backed us all the way.“Even though the game is just down the road, the away backing we’ve had this season is brilliant.“Every week they turn out in their numbers and we need to repay that by getting a win tonight.“The fans love it, they are so passionate in these games.“Hopefully, tonight we can put things right because we didn’t in the other two this season.”Marshall has turned into something of a lucky charm for the Dark Blues in the last nine games.In that period, the Englishman has a % record after he missed the four-game winless spell through injury.He added: “I don’t think we’ve lost a game in this quarter – I can’t say I’ve been the dference but I’ve played five and won five!“So, hopefully, we take that unbeaten streak into tonight.“I’m feeling good, to be honest.“I didn’t feel anything after the game last Saturday and was fine on Sunday morning – the previous week, I was a bit tight at the end of the Dunfermline game.“I actually signalled to come off but hadn’t realised we’d used our three subs.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

Like its parent ldquopolitically correct, woke is a passion of the urban left. It is PC for the age of LGBTQIA+. suggested ldquowoke as word of the year, which arguably it should be, though not for the reason it thinks. For woke has changed meaning in the last  months, and become a term of derision, referring to a style of self-righteous, right-on thinking favoured by, well,columnists. It is now used to denote the metropolitan identity politics that contributed to Labourrsquos greatest defeat since the s.:Guy Stenhouse: Time to Get Over itNo-one is sure where the word ldquowoke came from, except that it emerged from African-American vernacular for ldquostaying alert, as in ldquostay woke, brother. In recent years it was adopted by the BlackLivesMatter movement with their hashtag #staywoke ndash meaning keeping black issues uppermost on social media.It was soon adopted by white millennials to emblemise not just racial awareness but a whole identitarian outlook on le. Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers. They adore so-called ldquonon-binary people who claim not to identy with any gender. No-one is quite sure what non-binary means. Do they swing both ways  No, thatrsquos bisexual. Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain. This compendium of woke identitarianism came complete with a middle-aged white dad. He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists. Who knew There is a sanctimoniousness and intolerance about woke culture that is itself sometimes redolent of the authoritarian right, especially its approach to language. Anyone who mistakenly says ldquocoloured people instead of ldquopeople of colour, for example, will be ostracised. Pronouns must be obeyed. Feminist academics are no-edthey question whether transwomen are biologically female.Barack Obama warned the Democratic Party to avoid this ldquowoke politics with its ldquocancel culture. This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes. It will take more than a landslide defeat to persuade them otherwise."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-fruiting-lichen-discovered-easter-ross","story":"But, for the first time, a rare ldquofruiting lichen known as Multiclavula corynoides has been discovered in the British Isles ndash growing unassumingly on a gravel road in the Highlands of Scotland.It is not known how long the moss-like plant has been resident north of the Border and it may never have been spotted but for a lucky encounter with a lichen expert working with Scottish Natural Heritage.The find of Multiclavula corynoides ndash sometimes referred to as Club-wielding Crust Lichen ndash was made by David Genney, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos lichen expert, while he was out mountainbiking around Ben Wyvis National Nature Reserve in the Highlands of Scotland.The lichen occurs across Scandinavia, in Iceland and in northern North America but this is the first record of the species in Britain.Most lichens are composed of a cup-fungus and an alga with distinctive circular jam-tart blooms, but this species is dferent because it forms tiny clubshaped ldquofruits which emerge from a mat of algae and fungal threads.It was discovered on the verge of a gravel forest road at the base of Ben Wyvis nature reserve, the slopes of which are home to a huge range of plants, mosses, liverworts and lichens.Mr Genney said: ldquoI was out with a couple of friends enjoying a dayrsquos mountain-biking around Ben Wyvis. While Irsquom usually focused on the trail ahead and wide mountain views I also keep half an eye out for interesting plants and fungi, especially on the long, slow uphill section.ldquoI suppose I was secretly hoping for an excuse for a rest so was delighted when I spotted something a little dferent out of the corner of my eye.The naturalist said he had been inspired to find rare lichens by a project run by Kew gardens in London that aims to seek out unusual and undocumented fungi across the UK.There are an estimated . million species of fungi worldwide ndash and possibly millions more ndash but, because of their often remote habitats, gaining information on their whereabouts can be hard.The Kew Gardens scheme is a five-yearlong effort calling on scientists and the public to rediscover lost species, to look for rare ieties, revisit sites known from historical records for a fresh look, and survey plausible locations for new populations.It was with this in mind that Mr Genney managed to spot the crop of Multiclavula corynoides, despite its remote location.He said: ldquoI recognised it because the Kew Lost and Found Fungi project have been encouraging citizen scientists to look out for rare or under-recorded species.ldquoThey had highlighted a related lichen as one of their target species so things like this were on my radar.ldquoItrsquos always exciting to find something yoursquove never seen but for it to be a species that has never been seen in Britain before made my day.ldquoThe discovery fills a gap in our knowledge of the global distribution of this little fungus. Itrsquos also interesting that it was thriving on an old forestry road siding, demonstrating how nature can sometimes benefit from man-made habitats.ldquoIt just shows the importance of keeping your eyes peeled when yoursquore out and about enjoying the outdoors ndash you never know what you might discover.The discovery may be down to next yearrsquos autumn delivering perfect conditions for fungi to bloom.A damp end to the summer and a wet autumn created fertile ground for them, with some species which usually haunt dark corners being seen in the open.Gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens and Partner Gardens have reported findings of unusual species, giant specimens and prolerations of ldquofairy rings made of red and white-spotted toadstools."},{"url":null,"title":"staffs-sake-put-end-boxing-day-sales","story":"When I worked in a city centre coffee shop, Boxing Day would begin with a glut of weary women pouring through our glass double doors not long after wed opened, laden with plump red bag after plump red bag from the Next Boxing Day sale.It started at what time  am  You started queueing at WHAT time  am  For clothes  The first time I came across it my mind was boggled. Could. Not. Compute.After the slew of early morning shoppers, it would be relatively calm as there wasnt an awful lot to come into the city for.New Years Day, too, would be eerie on the way into work as every other shop front was shuttered. By lunchtime we would be jam packed with stragglers who had come into the city centre for a look around only to find the place a ghost town. Mostly it was tourists, holiday makers who didnt realise the entire country was also on holiday.Now, in the city centre, youre spoiled for choice on New Years Day. No need to stay home when you can head into town.My memory might be playing tricks, but around that time, Im sure, Next was a one-off for its early opening hour, which was why the sale created such a legion of annual fans. Not so now.This year Matalan advertised am opening hours for some of its stores. Yesterday at the Intu Victoria Centre in Nottingham, shoppers queued from am, their Christmas dinners still halfway along their alimentary canals. Thats barely enough time to have digested the clfhanger from the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special before heading to the shops.Marks and Spencer got in ahead of the crowd by starting its online sale at pm on Christmas Day.And this is where the annual handwringing about gross consumerism begins but now we have an added tension - the environmental impact.Of course weve long known that consumerism has a negative environmental impact but this year it cant be ignored, Greta Thunberg has made sure of that.As Australian bushfires rage out of control, as children strike for climate action and as Donald Trump ties himself in knots over what wind is or isnt, we simply cant justy the unfettered desire for stuff that washes over us come Christmas time.Yet, as the planet is dying, so too is the high street.This year Scotland has seen some of the worst sales figures on record with store after store folding and hundreds of jobs being made redundant. Sales yesterday were expected to fall by . per cent on last year in real le shops, although online sales were expected to rise by  per cent.Boxing Day, for many retailers, remains the busiest in the calendar year and, against such bleak trading conditions, who can grudge them it Not everyone making the journey to the high street will be buying an entirely unnecessary set of hair straighteners to replace the nigh-on identical set of hair straighteners they bought last year. Not everyone will be buying their seventh pair of boyfriend jeans, each pair imperceptibly dferent from the last.Some people will be buying important household items that theyve waited all year to pick up, say. Or treating themselves to an item they otherwise couldnt afford. Something they might not \"need\" but that makes them feel better.Its not fair or reasonable to tar all frantic shoppers with one brush.As long as people are making justiable choices - without kidding themselves over what they want and what they need - then fine.For once we could perhaps look to Trump as a positive example. I mean, sort of. Grudgingly and at a push. Asked on Christmas Eve what hed bought for his we, the US President said he had only bought her a Christmas card. Im sure it was the most beautul and bigliest card ever but still, when you have everything you could possibly need, a card is enough.Hopefully Melania saw it the same way and wasnt expecting diamonds on Christmas morning. Still, Im quite sure shes used to being disappointed by her husband.Friends, this year for the first time, stepped back from gt buying. One of my friends doesnt want presents now she has children one feels we are too old for Christmas gts another feels the time of year is too stressful and so wanted to cut out the added pressure of buying presents.I love giving and receiving gts with friends because I feel its a way of showing thought and care. Yet I cant quibble with any of my now non-gting buying friends because, ultimately, I have everything I need and I fret over my environmental impact.Among the annual conversation about how much is too much, we often forget the other people at the heart of our consumer decisions - the retail staff who are giving up festive time with loved ones to facilitate our shopping habits.Of course, theres a flip side there too. Some will appreciate being able to earn double time, particularly at the most wonderfully expensive time of year. Others wont celebrate Christmas others might be lonely at the holiday season and enjoy being at work.Yet, do we really need to have retail staff on hand to serve us at am  We dont, of course not. Christmas is as much a time to relax, pause, take stock. We have whittled this down to one shop-free day, meaning retail workers have to sacrice this precious lull to folk can benefit from  per cent off a bath bomb.We must cut down on our spending habits. The high street will need to change and adapt as this happens.But for now, couldnt the Boxing Day sales wait until December  An extra day to reflect might even make people stop to think about what they are consuming and why."},{"url":null,"title":"major-highland-road-closed-serious-morning-traffic-collision","story":"The Aheading towards Elgin is closed in both directions after emergency crews were scrambled to West Road near the town in response to a multiple vehicle crash.Eyewitnesses reported seeing fire crews using cutting equipment to free those invlved in the collision.#UPDATE#.#A #CLOSED##A is #CLOSED# in both directions due to an RTC just west of Elgin due to a serious RTCThe road is likely to remain closed for some time@NETrunkRoads #DriveSafe #PlanAhead pic WgoTPwfMotorists planning to travel on the road have been advised to find an alternative route.Police and ambulance crews remain on the scene.More to follow."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-forget-ghosts-past-need-politicians-can-build-better-future","story":"There was former First Minister Alex Salmond fronting his show, joined by former Labour MP Chris Williamson fresh from losing his deposit in the General Election, and former LibDem MP and reality TV star Lembit Oumlpik.I canrsquot imagine it was essential viewing even in the Putin household this Christmas.For the Ghosts of Christmas Present, festive producers turned to two men who just wonrsquot leave the stage.

And there are some politicians on the UK stage who are offering us hope.Step forward Rory Stewart, the former Tory MP now standing to be Mayor of London. ldquoThis was politics untethered no longer bound to the old rules of achievable promises, affordable policies and reality, he said of the recent election campaign, asking what happened to leaders prized for their dignity, moderation and seriousness.But his solution is not to retreat from politics, and meekly accept that it is broken, but to do more to engage with society ndash not less.That could be volunteering for a local cause, or looking out for neighbours in need. ldquoWe can still recover from grandstanding and sloganeering, but we will do it by being more practical, more local and more humble, he asserts.Someone  looking to the future is former Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander.His guide to disagreeing better will be heard on Radio  on Hogmanay, with a central theme that we dont always have to agree, but its how we do it that matters. His show focuses on a friendship in Northern Ireland forged in the hatred of the past, and offers a vision of a hopeful future for the country and for society at large.Learning to disagree better should be a New Yearrsquos resolution for many who hold elected office, particularly given the constitutional battles ahead.Another politician who has refused to accept this is as good as it gets is Labour MP Alison McGovern. She has posed five questions for everyone in the forthcoming Labour leadership election.The final one is ldquowhat is your plan for the challenges ahead ndash climate, ageing, technology for example ndash or will you seek to define yourself via the battles of the past It should equally apply to politicians from all parties.As we enter the centuryrsquos third decade, itrsquos time to forget the ghosts of the past.

These two melting pots, rather unedyingly, have had global issues added to them .What is missing here  Labour. Who would have thought, even five years ago, that the Labour Party would be neither the irresistible force nor the immovable object of Scottish politics  Yet here we are, and it is no small irony that the man who Torrance credited with first coining the \"Ulsterisation of Scottish politics\" phrase was Aiden Kerr, a then-broadcaster who went on to join Labours communications effort.The Labour Party, north and south of the border, is lying face-down in the dirt. It is faced with the stark choice of closing its eyes and dying, or opening them and understanding how to rehabilitate itself.The party is in this position primarily for two reasons a lack of leadership and a lack of relevance. The first of those is both the most obvious and instinctively should be the easiest to solve. Jeremy Corbyn has been calamitous for party and country the toxic mix of suspicion about his loyalty to Britain, his indecisiveness on big issues like Brexit, his unconvincing reaction to the anti-Semitism crisis and his Marxism made him a figure of suspicion and despair amongst the mainstream, with his popularity limited to a cultist echo-chamber on Twitter.Like most cults, it thinks the problem is the opposite of what it actually is, and so it appears almost inevitable that Labour is ready to repeat its mistake ndash to meet Einsteins definition of insanity by doing the same thing over and over again and expecting dferent results ndash by elevating Corbyns chosen successor to the role. Rebecca Long-Bailey is a gt for Boris Johnson, wrapped in sparkly blue paper and tied in a bow.If she does win, Labours moderate MPs have one decision to make, but for the purposes of this article I shall place that to one side. For the more urgent decision must be made by the partys MSPs who,  months from the Scottish election which is likely to result in a final decision on the second independence referendum, have no role and no relevance.In order to get some, first Scottish Labour must accept its position and start to exploit it. In many ways, it still thinks and behaves like a large party, unable to understand the reality that it is no longer in either government or opposition. But it could exploit its position, particularly the position of not being one of the \"Ulsterised\" political poles.For Labours lack of relevance to the Scottish constitutional debate actually allows them to be far more nimble than either the SNP or the Tories it allows them to change, radically and quickly. The centrepiece of that change must be to sever all ties with the UK Labour Party.This is a change which is coming to all the pro-UK parties it is a matter of time. The truth is that we collectively bungled the set-up of the Scottish Parliament, andHolyrood had been populated by political parties of and for it, rather than limbs of their UK brethren, it is entirely possible that we would not be in the position in which we are. The Tories and Labour, in particular, recoil against accusations of being \"branch offices\", but having worked in that environment I know that the cold reality is that they are, re veranot de facto.Labour can gain a first mover advantage by shting towards a Canadian model, whereby it creates a separate identity for itself , unique, Scottish, with none of Londons baggage, and its own positions.With it, the party has a signicantly greater chance of creating a viable narrative on the key issue of the day in Scotland ndash independence. We should, by now, be past the point of seeing this as a short-term issue. It has been simmering for a  years, bubbling for  and boiling for , and whatever the result of the now-likely second independence referendum, its effects will remain with us for the rest of our lives. Scottish Labour cant sit this one out.By creating its own, fully autonomous party and brand, Labours MSPs can do what the SNP doesnt need to do, and what the Tories appear to be unable to do, which is to create the one solution to this conundrum that the Scottish people have consistently said they want but which has never been offered to them ndash the \"something in the middle\" option.Thus far, the debate within Labour has been how to again be one of the poles. Instead, Labour must accept that this is a game it cannot win, and instead it should invent a new game. Instead of attempting to replace a pole, it should create a new one of its own.Labour could be the antidote to the \"Ulsterisation\" of our politics which, as sure as night follows day, will in time repel and disgust a large swathe of the centre ground of Scotlands electorate. That is the future for Scottish Labours MSPs. A party with unique and bespoke positions on the constitution, on the balance between fair taxation and enterprise, between environmental care and economic growth, between public service investment and public service reform.In short, they could be a European-style social democratic party. And, in a post-indyref  environment, they could win again.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-queen-right-bumpy-old-ride","story":"IN her annual speech to the nationthe Queen described  as a ldquobumpy year.

The late author William McIlvanney once told us a story about the downside of fame. Willie was in a pub in his home town of Kilmarnock, attempting to enjoy a quiet drink. Up popped a chap who said: ldquoI donrsquot like to interrupt, but somebody wants to meet you. At the end of the bar was a man in a raincoat clutching a poly bag full of writing. The man began by telling McIlvanney he didnrsquot actually like his books but would value an opinion on his own work, which was lurking in the poly bag. ldquoIrsquom sorry, I donrsquot have my specs here, said McIlvanney, patting his left inside jacket pocket.

This week, we had the Boxing Day hunts, or faux hunts at least, where severe-looking people and their torn-faced hounds are pictured bouncing or scurrying along lanes, bringing entirely justiable terror to the countryside.Many sensitive people find such pictures disturbing. They think the horse-riders look insufferably pompous, which is undoubtedly unfair,entirely understandable. Itrsquos a good rule to guide you through le: never trust anyone on a horse. Far-right activist Hermann Goering believed it taught the rider mastery over another human being, which was a bit odd as most people looked down on him as a fat turd.All the same, to be up there, master of all you survey, might be accounted marvellous by anyone who doesnrsquot think he looks a perfect fright in a prissy wee protective hat and a tweed jacket that fails to cover the lower buttocks. Sadly, having failed to evolve, the onward march of civilisation has left the fox-manglers on the brink of extinction, with almost all decent ratepayers in opinion polls welcoming their demise. Such a shame. Human beings can be so cruel sometimes.Speaking of ratepayers, decent or otherwise, and foxes , a clash between these took place in rural London this week. In a case that the RSPCA is investigating, an alleged human, Jolyon Maugham, battered an alleged fox to death with a baseball bat while wearing a kimono .To be clear, the kimono belonged to the manrsquos we. It was made of silk. The man is himself a silk or QC, a Remain-obsessed barrister opposed to beastly migrants entering his garden illegally. To be fair, he thought the fox was after his chickens ndash you townies just donrsquot understand the reality of country le in London. And anyway, most of you will have done something similar over the festive season, though few would be so imprudent as to publicise the achievement on social media.I think itrsquos fair to say that many Earthlings get a bit soppy when it comes to animals. Irsquove seen YouTube videos where people recount terrible things that have happened to them and, in the comments below, people say: ldquoBut was the cat all right These beasties are often referred to as ldquofur babies and videos of them when young get hundreds of thousands of views, even though, while other animals do genuinely seem to be playing, the average kittenrsquos every move mimics pouncing, slashing, eviscerating and killing. All together now: aaaww!But I must admit Irsquom as soft and goo-goo-ga-ga as the next grown man when it comes to baby animals. And my attitude to cats is the same as it is to humans: I deplore them as a species but count many as inidual friends.A major story in the papers this week involved a cat that had been missing for six or seven yearsand came home on Christmas Eve. The amazing thing was how unfazed it looked, just carrying on as normal, licking its posterior and so forth.Asthat werenrsquot enough, many papers filled their festive pages with the most spectacular pictures of wildle taken over the year, usually featuring flying, leaping, faffing aboot in the sea or having a square go with other beasties. Le of Reilly by the looks of it.Itrsquos amazing to think how our attitude to animals has changed in the last  years. We used to want to blooter them all with extreme prejudice. Now we try to protect them. There are mutts and moggies everywhere you look. A horror of both commitment and poop means I can never have a pet, and I sometimes envy those who do, even where they have clearly taken leave off their senses and mollycoddle the beasts to within an inch of their lives.But better mollycoddled than mangled in my view.+++IF I might paraphrase John Lennon: imagine there were no bagpipes. The nation was shocked to learn this week that bagpipe tuition is on the wane despite a healthy interest in the instrument from young persons with bags of puff to spare.According to the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust, while between , and , pupils want to blow into the bag, only , in state schools get the opportunity to do so. The trust hopes to change that, partly through community initiatives and the revival of bands.Well, there are worse things to shout. And worse instruments to play . Yonder Hittites may have provided the first archaeological evidence for bagpipes but, lo, the instrument is Scotiarsquos noo ndash and ever will be so.++++MORE and more people are starting to live in vans. This is nothing to do with the great British tradition of homelessness. Itrsquos a lestyle choice. Theyrsquore norsquo mad. Theyrsquore nomads.Itrsquos the old story: the mortgage, suburbia, the job getting them down. They want to do something with their lives, which is never a good idea in my view, and, worse still, they want to travel, which can only ever lead to trouble.Itrsquos the Good Le without having to grow veg, and it popped up this week in the popular prints, with more experiences recounted on YouTube and pictures posted on yon Instagram. This appears to be an ulterior motivation for many: becoming a star on social media.This is, Irsquom sure, a noble aim, particularly among those who make the more educational films that deal with the vexed subjects of how to keep yourself clean and where to have a wizz or worse.The more irresponsible take their bairns with them, rearing them as rootless was, who look oot the windae and never see the same thing twice. Doubtless, theyrsquoll grow up to be criminals or estate agents, as they learn the lesson of le: all is vanity.++++LIFE in the ghetto is hard, as many Edinburgh residents can tell you. Irsquom thinking in particular of those living around the central areas of Rose Street, Hanover Street and Frederick Street. Quite posh, and not your normal idea of a ghetto, but thus itrsquos been dubbed after residents were gubbed by the controversial capitalrsquos Hogmanay party.Theyrsquoll need to wear special wristbandsthey want access to their own homes during the disgraceful Bacchanalia. The development has led to further accusations that the city is becoming a ldquotheme park for touroids.Residents are also having to ldquoregister guests attending their own parties. Why anyone would want tolive in the centre of Edinburgh, orattend the cityrsquos Hogmanay revels, orattend any sort of party, is beyond me.I didnrsquot know that many people lived on those streets ndash itrsquos all shops and pubs. All the same, what kind of liberty is it, readers  Correct: diabolical.One resident said they were being treated ldquolike criminals, with their details passed to the police for checks.

Richer and stronger than any European power, at its height the Mughal Empire ruled over more than  million subjects and extended across most of the Indian subcontinent.The extraordinary splendour of the Mughal court was captured by artists in intricate paintings and manuscripts. George III was given a number of these magnicent works, forming one of the greatest collections of South Asian works on paper outside the subcontinent.In , Lord Teignmouth, Governor-General of India, presented the King with six volumes as gts from the Nawab of Awadh. Among these was the mid-th-century Padshahnama , an illustrated chronicle commissioned by the fth Mughal Emperor Shah-Jahan as a celebration of his reign and dynasty, described by Teignmouth as lsquothe most splendidrsquo Mughal manuscript he ever saw.The rise of the East India Company was also reflected in the gts of manuscripts presented to successive British monarchs on behalf of the Company and by Company officers.Such works included a Quran owned by Tipu Sultan of Mysore with an illuminated frontispiece and gilt-stamped and painted bindings, presented to George III. Detailed architectural drawings were commissioned from local draughtsmen by Colin MacKenzie, the Scottish Surveyor-General of the Company. A pen and ink drawing, c., shows a plan of the temple at Srirangam, one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India.Following her accession in , Queen Victoria received many illuminated royal letters and gts of paintings and manuscripts from South Asia. A posthumous portrait of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of the Punjab, c., was sent to the Queen by his successor, Sher Singh, in an unusual jewel-encrusted gold frame with a letter of belated congratulations on her marriage and the birth of her first son.It will be displayed alongside a sketch of his son, Maharaja Duleep Singh, by Queen Victoria. Following the East India Companyrsquos annexation of the Punjab in , Duleep Singh moved to England where he became a favourite of the Queen, regularly visiting Osborne House and Windsor Castle.Queen Victoria received many books written about or dedicated to her from India, including a volume of her own published journals, The Queenrsquos Travels in Scotland and Ireland, translated into Hindi by the Maharajah of Benares.The Queen recorded the bookrsquos arrival in England: lsquoMy book, translated into Hindustani, beautully illuminated, containing a painting of me, by a native artist, receiving the present from the Maharajah of Benares, bound in inlaid marble, is very curious  really beautul.rsquoVictoriarsquos interest in South Asian culture continued throughout her le. Her studies of the Hindustani language, undertaken in her seventies with her Indian secretary Abdul Karim, are recorded in her Hindustani diaries, which will be displayed in the exhibition with her Hindustani phrasebook.Queen Victoriarsquos second son Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh was the first member of the royal family to visit India in , followed six years later by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales , who toured India for four months in -.This second trip acted as a precursor to the formal declaration of Queen Victoria as Empress of India in . During his tour the Prince was presented with several works of art from the Hindu courts of northern India including a series of vibrant paintings from Jaipur that reproduced verses from the Sanskrit devotional poem Gita Govinda .Although King Edward VII never ed to India, he sent his brother and later his son, the future King George V, on royal tours of South Asia.

Their tour was documented in photographs and souvenir books, including albums and scrapbooks compiled by Queen Mary herself in addition to inidual photographs mounted together to form a panorama of key moments of the  Durbar, an imperial assemblage, including when King George V formally proclaimed himself Emperor of India.Queen Mary noted in her diary from the tour of the subcontinent that she lsquowas particularly interested in the exquisite drawings by native artistsrsquo. She acquired numerous South Asian works of art, including Queen Tissarakshita, , by Abanindranath Tagore, founder of the Bengal School of Art, and several Pahari paintings, including  folios illustrating The story of Prahlada from the Bhagavata Purana, c.-, by the Nainsukh family workshop.After the death of King George V in , Queen Mary presented a number of her South Asian works of art to the Victoria and Albert Museum and a selection of her Indian books, photographs and archival material to the India Office Library.Many of the finest pieces in her collection remained in the Royal

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The name Vale of Scapa will be held in reserve and usedthe council decides in future to replace the third tug as well.A winner has been drawn from the votes for the most popular group of names. Isobel Thompson from Westray has been invited to take part in the naming ceremony for Odin of Scapa and offered the opportunity of a family trip aboard the new tug.Graham Sinclair, chair of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “As names that strongly reflect Orkney’s Norse heritage, these are an excellent choice for the new tugs.“Tugs operated by first class crews play a vital role at the heart of our harbour operations and have helped support the welcome growth in maritime activity we’ve seen in local waters in recent years“I am pleased we are investing in even more capable vessels, which will ensure the continuation of  years of support for the Flotta Terminal and, more recently, the signicant growth in ship to ship work # and allow us to make the most of current and future marine business opportunities, greatly benefiting the economy of the islands.”The design and build contract for the -metre tugs was secured by Sanmar Shipyards of Turkey after a competitive tendering exercise.Construction is taking place at Sanmar’s new specialist tug building facility at Altinova, about an hour south of Istanbul, where work on both tugs is progressing well # as can be seen from the latest photographs taken during a recent inspection by Orkney Marine Services towage staff.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

An exit poll at pm yesterday predicting a possible SNP gain from the Liberal Democrats ultimately proved to be wrong, with a comfortable majority of , for Mr Carmichael in the end.It was Mr Carmichael#s sixth win in the Northern Isles. He has been the MP for the seat since .The Lib Dem used his acceptance speech first to thank the ing officers, the other candidates for a #spirited and good-natured campaign#, his own campaign team, and we and family, who had been #staunch in their support#.He went on to say that representing the people of Orkney and Shetland had been, and remained, his #greatest privilege#.It was more of a #mixed picture#, as Mr Carmichael said prior to his election result announcement, for the Lib Dems across the board.The party were unable to capitalise on their strong anti-Brexit message in this election, making a net loss of one seat across the UK. They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives. Targeting leave-voting Labour areas seems to have paid off for the Prime Minister.Labour lost  seats on the night, prompting leader Jeremy Corbyn to announce that he intends to stand down.Their candidate Coilla Drake called it a #sad, sad day#.Mr Carmichael also used his acceptance speech to criticise Mr Johnson and his incoming government.#The next five years is going to be a dficult and dangerous for this, our United Kingdom,# he said.The newly re-elected MP, however, ended on an almost hopeful note, focusing on the need for #liberal voices#, unity and solidarity, which he said was #greater than ever before#.The turnout for the Orkney and Shetland election was just under  per cent, with , Northern Isles folk voting. raquoSo , how did the Remain parties# anti-Brexit policies work out for them  Ten years of Tory government, as a direct result.

As a Swede I feel a strong fellowship. Hope the outcomewon#t tarnish it.No Brian, the SNP only say they want to Remain, as a stick to beat Westminster with.Their defining policy, independence, was guaranteed to take us out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on independence Day. The EU has confirmed this #repeatedly#.They also know they would be unable to rejoin until we satisfy the EU#s onerous conditions, notably:. Austerity to cut necessary borrowing within EU Stability and Growth Pact guidelines. .Establish our own central bank and currency # this will take nine years .. Hand the EU control of our economy and trade, agriculture and fisheries.Throw in control ofenergy and our military and Scots will never vote for it. They know that, too. So expect a policy switch, replacing EU membership with EFTA. . It follows that they are only demanding Indyref  because they #ken fine weel# it won#t be allowed and will use that to stoke phoney grievance against Westminster, with the added advantageof it being over before we find out what kind of trade deals Westminster achieves with the EU, US, etc.Goodness, so the SNP did so well because they are aLeave Party!No, Brian. The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#.Why don#t you tell us, Brian After all, you are one of the ones who deserted Labour, jumping ship to the SNP.The reasons for Labour#s demise in Scotland were not much to do with Brexit. It was well under way, long before Brexit. So back to my original point.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

That is something which needs rectied, ahead of narrow political aims and to ensure that we legislate for those crucial decisions in particular fair pay for our health workers and other public sector staff. “On a personal level it has been a momentous year for me with the arrival of Charlie in May.

Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Heartbroken son’s emotional tribute to his road victim father...his ‘rock’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp opposes call to ban hunting with dogs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theyre a tradition which need to be maintained.\"On a wider point, I have never seen anything wrong with hunting for control, but people who complain about these hunts are missing the point.\"Its not about killing foxes, its about people with a love of horses and tradition coming together in a colourful occasion, occasions that have been held for years.\"The League Against Cruel Sports, though, maintains more than halfof respondents to polling carried out believe hunting with dogs is already banned in Northern Ireland as it is in England, Wales and Scotland.Janice Watt, senior public affairs officer for the campaign group in Northern Ireland, said hunting and killing animals for sport might satisfy a small minority, but most people find it repulsive.She added: \"With polling showing widespread opposition to this so-called sport, its clear that hunting should be made illegal in Northern Ireland, and the league is working hard to ensure that as soon as Stormont sits again we get a ban to bring our nation into line with the rest of the UK.\"In a poll of , people living here released by the group, % of respondents believe it should be made illegal to hunt deer with live dogs, compared to % who believe it should remain legal.When it comes to fox hunting, % of respondents believe that it should be made illegal to hunt the animals, compared to % who think it should remain legal.The polling, commissioned by the group, asked people aged  and over living in Northern Ireland their views on a iety of animal welfare topics, including hunting.Of those polled, % believe it is illegal to use dogs to hunt live animals in Northern Ireland, compared with % who think it is legal and % who did not know."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/8bf58/38816876.ece/BINARY/ars-Winners-Graphic%202.jpg","title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Eames said yesterday: “It is an honour for me to receive this award, as having had direct associations with the Royal Air Force, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, the Aircrew Association, the Royal British Legion and the Royal Air Forces Association continuously since , it helps bring attention to the work of the Royal Air Forces Association, especially the Fermanagh Branch, and their care for the welfare of ex-RAF personnel in my home County Fermanagh.”Ciara Nicholl, MBEThe mother of a Co Fermanagh girl who died of a rare brain disorder three years ago, says she is humbled after being awarded an MBE for services to bereaved families in the UK and Ireland.Eight-year-old Ellie Nicholl from Enniskillen is believed to have been the only child in Ireland to have suffered from the rare progressive neurological condition H-ABC syndrome, which left her unable to walk or speak.After her death, Ciara and Billy founded Ellie’s Retreat, a charity which offers free respite breaks for families who have suffered the loss of a child.Located at Castle Archdale caravan park, Ellie’s Retreat is a static mobile, providing bed linen, towels and a small welcome pack of groceries.Since opening in March , Ellie’s Retreat has welcomed  families from across Ireland and the UK between St Patrick’s Day and Halloween each year.But Ciara says her MBE was a complete shock. “As I often say to people, we don’t do this for recognition but it is an honour that someone has gone to the trouble of putting me forward.”Tracy Hamilton, MBEA director of Mash Direct, Tracy Hamiltonhas been the driving force behind the Comber-based agri-food company which has now become a household name.She will be rewarded with an MBE for her contribution to the industry in Northern Ireland.The Co Down-based family-owned business along the shores of Strangford Lough was founded by Tracy and Martin Hamilton in .Mrs Hamilton was the first woman to sit on the Board of NIFDA and also a board member of Food NI.She sits on the committees of NI Heritage Gardens and the Irish Tree Society and is also an active volunteer on the Mencap Special Events Committee and has been organising high profile events for Mencap since .The Mash Direct director was also recognised as Outstanding Business Woman of the Year at the Women in Business Awards in  and SME Director of the Year at the Northern Ireland Director of the Year awards in .Alastair Hamilton, CBEInvest NI Chief Executive Alastair Hamilton will receive a CBE for services to economic development in Northern Ireland.Mr Hamilton, who announced his plan to stand down from the role earlier this year, will have his last official day in the post at the end of December.The father-of-four said that he was “delighted” to be awarded the honour.“I received a letter in the post a few weeks ago and it came as a huge surprise,” said Mr Hamilton. “It’s a real honour. It has been an honour, too, to have served the place I call home for  years and I’m humbled and absolutely delighted by the award,” he said.The -year-old added: “It has been a privilege to work in the role and I’m leaving with a level of pride in how far Northern Ireland has come in inward investment and export growth, despite the economic down turn.“I’m delighted to receive the award and I’d also like to pay tribute to all the staff who have done such wonderful work.”Aaron Hughes, MBENorthern Ireland football legend Aaron Hughes will be awarded an MBE in recognition of his services to football.The veteran defender, who is originally from Cookstown, Co Tyrone, retired earlier this year after Northern Ireland’s Euro  qualier win over Belarus.Hughes, who made his international debut in  against Slovakia, won  caps for his country, including  as captain.

Read MoreSolicitors lives saved by Irish interventionEamon OTuathail, the assistant secretary of the Anglo-Irish Section at the Department of Foreign Affairs, was told that Sir Robert Andrew, from the Northern Ireland Office, was seeking to discourage wedges being driven between the RUC and the Garda as a result.The details emerge in Irish State papers released in Dublin under the -year rule.In one confidential note an Irish Government official also stated that he believes Mr Fenn should have been forbidden what he described as a \"typically troublesome and self-indulgent excursion\". The official complained that the Department of Foreign Affairs was not informed about the trip.In a separate note, Department of Foreign Affairs official Declan ODonovan told British charge Robert Stimpson that the unauthorised disclosure was a deliberate one at low Garda level.\"It was not believed at this point that the document had passed to or through the hands of a subversive organisation as had been alleged,\" Mr ODonovan added.In a letter marked secret, Mr OTuathail wrote to Michael Lillis at the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast stating that the protection of the British ambassador has nothing to do with the Secretariat or the Northern Ireland Office.\"As so far as advising the ambassador not to undertake any particular trip is concerned, we rely and must rely on the security assessment of the Garda Siochana,\" Mr OTuathail added.\"Needless to say, a decision to make such a request to the ambassador carries its own implications about the capacity of the State to protect the ambassador in the exercise of his normal s and therefore needs to be considered with particular care. I would add that it does not seem to me that forbidding the British Ambassador to undertake a visit to any of the jurisdiction is language appropriate to the diplomatic relations of two friendly, democratic States.\"During a later meeting between Mr Fenn and Mr OTuathail, the Irish official said that no one had used the words \"irresponsible\" over his boating activities.The official said he ended the meeting by telling Mr Fenn that Irish Ministers wanted to see the ambassador leading an active social le but within the constraints that \"unfortunately\" were needed for his personal safety.In  the IRA murdered Britains ambassador to Ireland Christopher Ewart-Biggs.The envoy was blown up in his official car by a landmine just yards from his official home in south Dublin on July , .It happened just  days after he arrived in Dublin to take up the post.The ambassadors driver Brian ODriscoll survived the attack but was seriously injured.At the time Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave said that \"this atrocity fills all decent Irish people with a sense of shame\".Prime Minister James Callaghan also strongly condemned the assassins as a \"common enemy whom we must destroy or be destroyed by\"."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/62958/38812320.ece/BINARY/cdb003.jpg","title":"welcome to the world northern irelands 2019","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

recipients could be viewed online from pm on Friday, shortly after news of their honours went public.The details were removed around an hour after the accidental disclosure.Its a farcical and inexcusable mistakeSilkie Carlo, Big Brother WatchThe Cabinet Office apologised, said it was contacting those affected, and had referred itself to the regulator.Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: “It’s extremely worrying to see that the Government doesn’t have a basic grip on data protection, and that people receiving some of the highest honours have been put at risk because of this.“It’s a farcical and inexcusable mistake, especially given the new Data Protection Act passed by the Government last year – it clearly can’t stick by its rules.”The list saw awards given to members of England’s World Cup winning cricket team, performers such as Sir Elton John and Grease star Olivia Newton-John, as well as former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith.Alison Saunders, the former director of public prosecutions, was also among the honours recipients, alongside -year-old D-Day veteran Harry Billinge, and -year-old schoolboy Ibrahim

soon as possible.“We apologise to all those affected and are looking into how this happened.“We have reported the matter to the ICOand are contacting all those affected directly.”In response to reports of a data breach involving the Cabinet Office and the NY Honours list, the ICO will be making enquiries.— ICODecember , Only six people honoured for services to defence were left off the list, according to the BBC.The ICO, which has the power to fine organisations for data breaches, said it was investigating.The introduction of General Data Protection Regulationrules in May  increased the penalties regulators such as the ICO are able to introduce.It means breaches can result in the ICO issuing penalties equivalent of up to % of annual global turnover or £ million – whichever is greater.Previously, the largest penalty the ICO meted out was to Facebook when it was fined £, – the maximum allowed at the time – for failing to protect users’ personal data.\" width\"\" \"\"

become the largest penalty ever issued by the regulator once the process is completed.The ICO later handed out an intention to fine the hotel chain Marriott International £ million after it admitted the guest records of around  million people had been accessed.Hackney councillor and charity pioneer Mete Coban, who was handed an MBE for services to young people, told the PA news agency: “If those responsible have apologised and it is a genuine error, then there is not much more that can be done.“I understand why others are concerned, but most of my details are online because of the council

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

And we visited all the local shops and businesses on Central Drive with gts to say thank you for everything they have done for us.

But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks.Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the “New World” and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.”This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.”The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. It is a matter of historical record that Englands King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after the Second World War that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day.An English farmer, Thomas Tusser. noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey, appeared as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That, of course, came in  when Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew.According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year – nine million of those for the Christmas season alone. However, that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the US, three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day.In Norway, for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway, they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany, the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile, in Jamaica Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At a traditional Argentinean Christmas dinner you’ll most probably find turroacuten at dessert. Turroacuten, also known as nougat, is typically made of sugar, honey and egg white, with toasted almonds or other nuts. It comes in dferent shapes, such as a rectangular tablet or a round cake. googletag.cmd.push   - Australia  It might be hot in Australia at Christmas time, but Australians still have a White Christmas. This is the name of their traditional Christmas dessert. It’s basically a mixture of raisins, cherries, dried coconut, icing sugar, milk powder and rice bubbles, with hydrogenated coconut oil as the ingredient that puts all the rest together. White Christmas is usually served cut into squares and because it’s very easy to make even children give it a try in the holiday season.  - Belgium  Belgians bake cougnou or bread of Jesus during Christmas time. This sweet bread is formed like a baby Jesus and is decorated with dferent elements such as flowers, circles etc. The composition includes flour, eggs, milk, yeast, raisins, sugar and is usually enjoyed with a cup of hot chocolate. googletag.cmd.push  - Brazil  One of the most popular Brazilian desserts is pudim de leite condensado or condensed milk pudding, containing condensed milk , regular milk, eggs and caramelized sugar on top. Whether it’s Christmas or other festive occasions, Brazilians take every opportunity to serve this custard dessert.  - Canada  The Yule log, a dessert shaped to resemble a miniature log or a chopped off tree branch, is a form of sweet roulade made of sponge cake. It is traditionally prepared for Christmas in other countries as well for example, in France it’s known as bucircche de Noeumll. The original Yule log recipe dates back in the th century and has developed many iations along the way. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate butter cream.   - France  In France, it is customary to serve  desserts at the Christmas table. Les treize desserts de Noeumllrepresent Jesus Christ and the  apostles and they include walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, apples, pears, green melon, black and white raisins, figs oranges and mandarins. The desserts are traditionally set out on Christmas Eve and remain on the table three days, until December .  - Iceland  Iceland’s Laufabrauethconsists of a round, very thin flat cake with a diameter of about  to  cm , decorated with leaf-like, geometric patterns and fried briefly in hot fat or oil. Baking this leaf bread is an important part of the Christmas preparations in every home in Iceland.  - India  A popular Christmas cake served by the Christian population of Hindustan in India is the allahabadi, a rum fruit cake originating and lending its name from the Northern Indian city of Allahabad. It’s made with maida flour, eggs, claried butter, sugar, petha - a translucent soft candy from North India, marmalade, nuts, ginger and fennel as its main ingredients.  - Italy  The cupola-shaped sweet bread called panettone is originally from Milan and it became an omnipresent dessert on Italians’ Christmas Eve dinner. The process of properly preparing the panettone in order to obtain its distinctive fluffy characteristics takes several days. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as dried raisins. It is served in slices, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine. In some regions of Italy, it is served with crema di mascarpone or crema di zabaione.  - Japan  Even though Christmas is not a national holiday in Japan - with only about  percent of Japan’s population being Christian - the Japanese do have a Christmas cake. The dessert is a type of sponge cake, covered with snow-white whipped cream and topped with red strawberries. The red and white in this cake reminds of the Japanese flag colors and this is probably why the cake became so popular in Japan that it even has its own emoji. The Japanese Christmas cake is a perfect example of Western traditions being adopted by the Japanese culture and given a dferent and fresh meaning.  - Mexico  Hot beverages are almost as popular as baked desserts at Christmas time. In Mexico, the drink that accompanies the festive meal is atole, which includes masa , water, piloncillo , cinnamon, vanilla and optional chocolate or fruit. Atole ies in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin liquid consistency. Instead of masa as a main ingredient, rice, flour, or oatmeal can be used.  - Norway  The most commonly eaten Christmas cookie in all of Norway is pepperkake - translated as pepper cake. It’s a ginger bread cookie spiced with black pepper and formed into a heart or other shape. Pepperkake is complemented with coffee, tea or especially gloslashgg, a spiced drink served warm, with or without alcohol.

The owner was visiting the city from the South. So, as you can imagine, he was absolutely overjoyed by our call.He was so grateful, in fact, he gave us pound to pass on to the girls.In recognition for their honesty and quick-thinking, the girls were rewarded with “Angel of Courage” certicates at St Johns Primary School Advent assembly.We are very proud of the children for making this Christmas miracle happen, said St Johns teacher, Amanda Murphy.Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilias, said: We are just so proud of Ciarrai and her two friends from St. John’s Primary School.They are such lovely role models to all in our schools and community - honest and kind.

Cllr Cusack said it was “reassuring” to have had the officers react so quickly to her request to try tackle the problem by installing surveillance cameras at the “hot spot.” She added: “I know that there’s hardly a street which is not affected by fouling throughout city and district and sympathise with residents and those affected. “However, given there are only a few of these cameras and a lot of resources needed to monitor them, it’s a case of having to prioritise areas.“Hopefully, the public will understand that a school deserves the attention and other areas can be looked at going forward.“There are also limitations with regards to where and how surveil- lance can be conducted. While this may help deter irresponsible owners allowing their dogs to stray and foul, realistically it will not eradicate the problem, it is a mindset which has to change and that is not easy. “I would keep calling on the public to report and assist Environmental Health with any information they may have.”Concluding Councillor Cusack said: “Meanwhile, I will be addressing the prospect of Council investing in more such cameras and resources to combat the problem.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

During the past year there have been a lot of successful partnerships including the Walled City Brewery and Tornion Panimo Brewery in Lapland linking up to create a new Golden Ale and a Gose style beer, following the success of their first collaboration in . There was also the creation of the Derry milk stout sausageand the Foyster stout made using the unique Lough Foyle Irish Flat Oyster.A number of innovative products have also been created, including Grainola Goddess which is made using the special spent grain from the by-product of the brewing process and the first of its type in the world.Jenner O’Donnell, tourism manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, said  was a hugely successful year in promoting local food produce and celebrating the wealth and quality of the local food industry.She added: “Among the success stories during  was the participation of  companies through  ious innovation projects as part of the Foodovation project.

She added: “We are really excited about this new brand and how it will allow us to showcase our food and drink offering and wealth of local quality produce.“The website will feature all our local food and drink businesses who become accredited under the new brand. “There are set criteria and requirements which must be met to become involved, and these are very important to ensure accredited businesses are fully supporting the brand and development of the food destination. “Businesses accredited will benefit from listing on the website, inclusion within marketing and permission to use the new brand. “We are encouraging all those involved in the food and drink business to get involved, and are keen to work with businesses to work towards accreditation.” Concluding, Ms Goligher said: “We strongly believe that a collaborative approach to promoting our region’s food offering is the best way forward and we look forward to a great ”Businesses interested in becoming accredited can contact Catherine for more information directly at catherine.goligher@derrystrabane .

This year saw the launch Derry City and Strabane District Councils forward thinking and ambitious Food and Drink Strategy and Action Plan alongside the establishment of a Food Network that consists of a -member committee and a wider network of over  food and drink related businesses.  This has been supported by Interreg Europe NICHE project that commenced in March  and runs to the end of December this year with a focus of supporting food and drink best practices from a number of regions across Europe including Romania, Finland, Crete, Estonia and Poland. googletag.cmd.push  DCSDC is one of seven partners involved in the collaboration. During the past year there have been a lot of successful partnerships including the Walled City Brewery and Tornion Panimo Brewery in Lapland linking up to create a new Golden Ale and a Gose style beer, following the success of their first collaboration in . There was also the creation of the Derry milk stout sausageand the Foyster stout made using the unique Lough Foyle Irish Flat Oyster.  A number of innovative products have also been created, including Grainola Goddess which is made using the special spent grain from the by-product of the brewing process and the first of its type in the world. googletag.cmd.push Jenner O’Donnell is Tourism Manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council. She says  was a hugely successful year in promoting local food produce and celebrating the wealth and quality of the local food industry. Among the success stories during  was the participation of  companies through  ious innovation projects as part of the Foodovation project. Over half of those companies were from the Derry City and Strabane District Council area and consisted of restaurants or small companies who wanted to develop a retail product.  The LegenDerry Street Food Festival that was held in July was attended by , during the three day festival which was hailed a huge success, while theof the Slow Food Festival as part of the Taste the Island Initiative was widely welcomed and expanded into a five day programme of events and experiences.  James Huey, Chair of the LegenDerry food and drink network says he has “no doubt that  will be seen as the year that the city and district experienced a step change in becoming an iconic Food Destination. The launch of the Food Network, which involves the industry working in collaboration with DCSDC council, is a unique model in Ireland. The benefits of this are already being seen, with the success of the inaugural Street Food Festival, and the incredible events based around the Taste The Island initiative, leading to many tour operators declaring Derry-Londonderry in their Top  attractions in the island!  Catherine Goligher, Food Tourism Officer with the Council said she was extremely proud of the achievements of the past year and the success in further developing and promoting Derry and Strabane as a leading food destination. She said the Council along with the LegenDerry Food and Drink Network have hugely ambitious plans for  including the launch of the new LegenDerry Food and drink Brand and website in February. “We are really excited about this new brand and how it will allow us to showcase our food and drink offering and wealth of local quality produce.  “The website will feature all our local food and drink businesses who become accredited under the new brand. There are set criteria and requirements which must be met to become involved, and these are very important to ensure accredited businesses are fully supporting the brand and development of the food destination. Businesses accredited will benefit from listing on the website, inclusion within marketing and permission to use the new brand. We are encouraging all those involved in the food and drink business to get involved, and are keen to work with businesses to work towards accreditation. We strongly believe that a collaborative approach to promoting our region’s food offering is the best way forward and we look forward to a great ”  Businesses interested in becoming accredited can contact Catherine for more information directlycatherine.goligher@ derrystrabane.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites.

In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
