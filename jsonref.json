But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

Czech Republic president Milos Zeman (pictured) is known for his pro-Kremlin viewsMeanwhile, the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said up to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent were used in the attack on Skripal and his daughter Yulia.Ahmet Uzumcu told the New York Times the amount of Novichok used - around half a cup of liquid - suggests it was created for use as a weapon rather than for research purposes.Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were left fighting for their lives in hospital after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury on March 4.The inquiry into the nerve agent attack in the Wiltshire city has involved 250 detectives who have gone through more than 5,000 hours of CCTV and interviewed more than 500 witnesses.Mr Uzumcu told the paper the Novichok could have been applied as a liquid or aerosol.He said: \u0027For research activities or protection you would need, for instance, five to 10 grams or so, but even in Salisbury it looks like they may have used more than that, without knowing the exact quantity, I am told it may be 50, 100 grams or so, which goes beyond research activities for protection.\u0027It\u0027s not affected by weather conditions. That explains, actually, that they were able to identify it after a considerable time lapse.\u0027He added the samples collected suggested the nerve agent was of \u0027high purity\u0027.

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/13/4BB4F23700000578-5691219-image-a-71_1525436953731.jpg","title":"Who Candace Owens Kanyes favorite free thinker","story":"    After being praised on Twitter, Candace Owens and her boss Charlie Kirk secured a meeting with Kanye West and the trio met in CaliforniaReturning to the social media platform after a breakdown in 2016, Kanye tweeted: ‘I love the way Candace Owens thinks,’ and followed up this tweet with one reading ‘Only free thinkers.’Frank Ocean parodied this tweet by posting: ‘I love the way Michelle Wolf thinks.’ But who is Candace Owens?Who is Candace Owens?Born in Stamford, Connecticut, Candace is an American writer and conservative commentator.While she was in high school, she received a number of racist phone calls that were later traced to a car in which the son of Governor Dannel Malloy was present.Candace’s family sued the Stamford Board of Education and won a $37,500 settlement.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns were VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.          Tami was forced to resort to using a sextant to navigate following the storm Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.          The couple had already covered more than 50,000 miles of ocean sailing together so the prospect of covering 4,000 miles together over the course of three weeks wasn\u0027t dauntingTrue, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’A disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.          The boat was flipped end over end after Richard ordered Tami below decks after he spotted a massive wave heading directly towards the boat when he was washed overboard Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.Overwhelmed with grief and shock, Tami was initially paralysed, unable to comprehend the truth.A serious head injury and blood loss meant that she drifted in and out of consciousness.On the verge of a mental breakdown, catatonic, she failed to move or eat, her life seemingly at an end as she explained movingly in her memoir: ‘I know in a blinding flash he’s gone overboard. Snatched by the boiling cauldron of the ocean, whipped to a frenzy by the hurricane. When I realised he wasn’t there, I wanted to die.‘From the depths of my soul, I feel an animal roar inside me. I scream and rage at the vast sea that’s torn my man from me… I slip in and out of consciousness, delirious, half-dead.’Briefly, she contemplated joining her fiancé in the depths of the now calm water.And it was then that the miracle took place: a voice in her head demanded she bail out the boat to prevent it from sinking. Confused, Tami at first feared she might have brain damage, yet the voice – sometimes Richard’s, sometimes her own, sometimes her parents’ – was persistent. It urged her to get up, to eat and to make a plan to get to land.Faint, dizzy, she tried to resist its demands before suddenly snapping-to as she explained, reliving the moment a few years later: ‘Virtually everything has been swept overboard. Then I see it, floating in front of me. A jar of peanut butter. I grab it, yank the lid off, scoop out a mouthful. It sticks to my tongue like a slug to concrete. I force it down. I need food, I must get my brain and body functioning.’And so the days went by with the voice as her only companion on the lonely waters. Tami found the boat’s tinned rations among the wreckage and calculated that she could make them last up 40 days before starvation would set in. Then she turned her attention to creating a sail.The original was shredded and the mast broken, but there was a heavy-duty sail still rolled up in its cover.Although Tami was still struggling with the head injury, she managed to attach the sail to a broken pole and raise it.At just 45 square feet, it was small – but it was enough. A second important victory.By day nine of her ordeal, Tami could both sail and steer and briefly allowed herself a degree of hope. Grief was, for now, pushed aside.          Tami, pictured, managed to navigate by the stars and found her way to Hawaii She rationed her water supply with life-saving discipline, taking only a few sips a day from the storage bag which supplied the shower. She also found some beer and – incongruously – Cuban cigars, which became her nightly treats.Tami had no electronic navigation, just an old-fashioned sextant, some waterlogged charts and the sun and the stars as she made for the safety of distant Hawaii.And at times, it became overwhelming, particularly when the wind and rain returned to lash the boat on day 11. Still, however, the forceful inner voice kept pulling her back to sanity. Stay the course, it said. ‘Fight for your life.’At other times she heard her mother or father, or her own voice. Sometimes, the voice yelled at her so loudly she jumped.Twice – on day 16 and then day 34 – she came within moments of rescue when a ship appeared on the horizon, but they failed to see her distress flares or the red T-shirt that she waved desperately at the end of an oar.Twice, too, a plane flew overhead, but again she was not spotted.At one point, she was so near Hawaii that she thought she might have overshot the islands, and was beginning to drift towards China – a terrifying possibility.In her absolute solitude Tami pondered whether she was already dead that she had become impossible to see, and the thought drove her close to ending her life.She loaded her rifle and put the muzzle her mouth, but the thought of never seeing her little brother grow up made her think again.It was just as well. For it was shortly afterwards, on Day 40, that Hilo Harbour on Hawaii – and salvation – came into view.It was nightfall and a perilous coral reef stood between her safety so, unable to risk going in until daylight, she endured one more agonising night before dawn broke and a rescue vessel sailed out from port to guide her home.It was time to contemplate her loss, yet Tami’s inner spirit once again counselled her to take courage. Few others would have survived the extraordinary voyage, it said. She should feel joy and pride before finally concluding: ‘I will always be with you’.It was the last time she would hear the voice that had truly saved her life.Tami arrived on land triumphant, but looking like a wild woman. It took three hairdressers two days to untangle her matted long blonde hair – which she was determined to keep long.‘I had lost everything, so there was no way I was going to give up my hair,’ she recalled.

It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.

The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

They also believe a white shroud will make it harder to spot on the skyline, sparking claims the tragedy could be forgotten.Instead they want it to be green, which is the colour that has been adopted by Grenfell survivors and campaign groups during vigils and marches, and on social media. Pulling down the sheeting and replacing it with a green one would cost up to £400,000, sources say.Officials had previously promised that the charred tower would be covered by early this year after psychologists warned that the sight of it was worsening the trauma of those living nearby.Scaffolding was put up in August – two months after the fire ripped through the building, killing 71. The first plastic sheets were put up in October and officials planned to cover up one floor every week.But the construction has been painfully slow and has stalled since the row erupted last month.

The anniversary is coming up and this is already a traumatic time for those affected by the fire. Now we will have to commemorate the dead with the charred remains still dominating the skyline. Once again, we have been ignored and neglected.’A group called Grenfell United – which represents many of those affected by the inferno – claims it asked for the shroud to be green back in December.It is understood to have copies of emails to officials proving this.

Tests have so far found that patients naturally ate 30 per cent less food after they were treated with the hormone injection which works in a similar way to a gastric band (file photo)To create the jab, researchers reproduced the satiety hormones without surgery.Professor Tricia Tan, a consultant in diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic medicine, who formulated the hormones, said: ‘While wearing the pump, you feel less hungry and you stop eating earlier.‘The sensation is like after you have eaten a big meal and you feel really full.‘What is even more exciting is that we are able to normalise blood sugar levels and they can come off diabetes medications.’One 38-year-old participant in the trial said he had had an \u0027instant reaction\u0027 to the hormones and that it made sweet food less attractive.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/05/13/4BDFFA9C00000578-5693961-The_97_tonne_plane_which_would_have_240_passengers_on_board_if_i-a-1_1525522962863.jpg","title":"Panicked residents plane fly just 2 000 feet test flight","story":"    An aeroplane\u0027s test flight flew as low as 2,000 feet over Bristol, sparking fears it was crashing          The 97-tonne plane, which would have 240 passengers on board if it was full, can be seen banking and flying low over treesThe plane, which will not complete any commercial flights until the end of 2018, flew low over Filton, Patchway and Almondsbury in South Glos on Thursday as part of a noise test.One of the videos posted on Facebook shows the plane moving slowly over the top of some houses while another shows it slanted to one side near some trees. One local resident said: \u0027Was so low to my mum\u0027s house, she was home alone and panicked.\u0027Caroline McMichael commented on Facebook: \u0027Not good for those who have anxiety.

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns were VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.          Tami was forced to resort to using a sextant to navigate following the storm Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.          The couple had already covered more than 50,000 miles of ocean sailing together so the prospect of covering 4,000 miles together over the course of three weeks wasn\u0027t dauntingTrue, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’A disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.          The boat was flipped end over end after Richard ordered Tami below decks after he spotted a massive wave heading directly towards the boat when he was washed overboard Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.Overwhelmed with grief and shock, Tami was initially paralysed, unable to comprehend the truth.A serious head injury and blood loss meant that she drifted in and out of consciousness.On the verge of a mental breakdown, catatonic, she failed to move or eat, her life seemingly at an end as she explained movingly in her memoir: ‘I know in a blinding flash he’s gone overboard. Snatched by the boiling cauldron of the ocean, whipped to a frenzy by the hurricane. When I realised he wasn’t there, I wanted to die.‘From the depths of my soul, I feel an animal roar inside me. I scream and rage at the vast sea that’s torn my man from me… I slip in and out of consciousness, delirious, half-dead.’Briefly, she contemplated joining her fiancé in the depths of the now calm water.And it was then that the miracle took place: a voice in her head demanded she bail out the boat to prevent it from sinking. Confused, Tami at first feared she might have brain damage, yet the voice – sometimes Richard’s, sometimes her own, sometimes her parents’ – was persistent. It urged her to get up, to eat and to make a plan to get to land.Faint, dizzy, she tried to resist its demands before suddenly snapping-to as she explained, reliving the moment a few years later: ‘Virtually everything has been swept overboard. Then I see it, floating in front of me. A jar of peanut butter. I grab it, yank the lid off, scoop out a mouthful. It sticks to my tongue like a slug to concrete. I force it down. I need food, I must get my brain and body functioning.’And so the days went by with the voice as her only companion on the lonely waters. Tami found the boat’s tinned rations among the wreckage and calculated that she could make them last up 40 days before starvation would set in. Then she turned her attention to creating a sail.The original was shredded and the mast broken, but there was a heavy-duty sail still rolled up in its cover.Although Tami was still struggling with the head injury, she managed to attach the sail to a broken pole and raise it.At just 45 square feet, it was small – but it was enough. A second important victory.By day nine of her ordeal, Tami could both sail and steer and briefly allowed herself a degree of hope. Grief was, for now, pushed aside.          Tami, pictured, managed to navigate by the stars and found her way to Hawaii She rationed her water supply with life-saving discipline, taking only a few sips a day from the storage bag which supplied the shower. She also found some beer and – incongruously – Cuban cigars, which became her nightly treats.Tami had no electronic navigation, just an old-fashioned sextant, some waterlogged charts and the sun and the stars as she made for the safety of distant Hawaii.And at times, it became overwhelming, particularly when the wind and rain returned to lash the boat on day 11. Still, however, the forceful inner voice kept pulling her back to sanity. Stay the course, it said. ‘Fight for your life.’At other times she heard her mother or father, or her own voice. Sometimes, the voice yelled at her so loudly she jumped.Twice – on day 16 and then day 34 – she came within moments of rescue when a ship appeared on the horizon, but they failed to see her distress flares or the red T-shirt that she waved desperately at the end of an oar.Twice, too, a plane flew overhead, but again she was not spotted.At one point, she was so near Hawaii that she thought she might have overshot the islands, and was beginning to drift towards China – a terrifying possibility.In her absolute solitude Tami pondered whether she was already dead that she had become impossible to see, and the thought drove her close to ending her life.She loaded her rifle and put the muzzle her mouth, but the thought of never seeing her little brother grow up made her think again.It was just as well. For it was shortly afterwards, on Day 40, that Hilo Harbour on Hawaii – and salvation – came into view.It was nightfall and a perilous coral reef stood between her safety so, unable to risk going in until daylight, she endured one more agonising night before dawn broke and a rescue vessel sailed out from port to guide her home.It was time to contemplate her loss, yet Tami’s inner spirit once again counselled her to take courage. Few others would have survived the extraordinary voyage, it said. She should feel joy and pride before finally concluding: ‘I will always be with you’.It was the last time she would hear the voice that had truly saved her life.Tami arrived on land triumphant, but looking like a wild woman. It took three hairdressers two days to untangle her matted long blonde hair – which she was determined to keep long.‘I had lost everything, so there was no way I was going to give up my hair,’ she recalled.

The project began in June 2017 in Grover’s church, where a parishioner invited him to see the clubs where he played “bones” or dominoes. “It was a revelation to me,” says Grover. “I had no idea that Caribbean migrants met three times a week for dominoes in Clapham, where I’ve lived for 30 years.”Intrigued, he began to visit domino clubhouses in Clapham, Croydon and Wandsworth. At first, people were wary of the stranger with a camera, but soon Grover was welcomed into homes, community centres, places of worship and even funerals.Grover discovered a much more important story waiting to be told: “I wanted to capture a Caribbean way of life that most likely won’t be around for ever.” He adds: “I feel so privileged to have been able to photograph the distinctive lives of this lovely community.”Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush at Tilbury in June 1948, the exhibition incorporates a number of interviews Grover conducted with Caribbean-born UK residents. “I knew I had to track down at least one surviving ‘Windrusher’ if I were to do justice to this story,” he says.His research took him to 92-year-old Alford Gardner in Leeds, who served in the RAF during the war as a motor mechanic. Having paid the standard £28 to cross the Atlantic on the Windrush, Gardner found work in Leeds with commercial engineers. Inevitably, as a Caribbean “room-seeker” back then he experienced racism (“Room to Let: Regret No Kolored”, ran the typical advert). Usually, though, there was no violence, as any aggressors fled once challenged. “I’ve lived a brilliant life here,” he told Grover. “It was supposed to be tough, but I never really had tough times.”In migrating here, the Windrush citizens believed they were exercising their birthright. “UK – Right of Abode” was stamped in their Commonwealth-issue passports. Teachers, lawyers, writers, artists and field labourers came in response to a recruitment drive and because they hoped for a better life. Not all of the Windrushers had intended to remain “in foreign”, but gradually it dawned on them that the dream of return was just that: they were here to stay. Curated by Katy Barron, the exhibition combines personal stories from first- and second-generation Caribbeans with a series of 12 themed photo-stories that, together, seek to describe the “totality” of their lives today. It explores the community, faith, love, death and friendship it looks at the lives of metalworkers, engineers, churchgoers and former NHS nurses.With his genial manner, Grover was granted access to photograph a Jamaican funeral and its Nine Night mortuary custom, where friends and relatives gather at the deceased’s house for food and drink. The tradition is fast disappearing among the young, but there is life in it yet. (As they say in Jamaica: “No call a man dead til you bury him.”)“Jamaican spirituality is such a beautiful thing,” says Grover, who wanted to capture Caribbean religious respect for a life well lived.His previous photographic exhibitions have documented a year in the life of a Clapham vicar, called Of Things Unseen, and the busy life of a neighbourhood, in last year’s 48 Hours on Clapham High Street. He shoots with a wide-angle lens: “That means getting in really close. At the Jamaican funeral I was literally standing at the grave’s edge. It required a good deal of trust.”For this project, Grover took photographs on 70 occasions. “In order to capture a dominoes match and its after-party, I sometimes had my camera out for long stretches – seven or eight hours. At other times, I just sat and listened to stories and watched life unfold in front of me.”The photographs are poignant and intimate. We see calypso-mento dancers in their “felts” (fedora hats) and domino hotshots banging down tiles. At crowded festive dance parties, or “bashments”, he photographed the elderly moving and flexing to jazz-tinged ska, rock-steady and reggae. The dapper Bockie, a regular at the Cosmo club in Wandsworth, told him: “Our generation… we’re rocking our bodies in our chairs.”Between 1948 and 1969, the formative years of the NHS, an estimated 5,000 Jamaican women came to the UK to work as nurses, while many others worked in different NHS roles. Monica Blair, one of Grover’s 12 photo subjects, arrived from Jamaica in 1964, aged 21, to marry Soney and worked as a cleaner at St Thomas’ hospital near Westminster, before becoming a seamstress. With her deep religious faith, Monica attends the same Anglican church in Clapham as Grover. In his photographs, she ministers communion wine and pores over a well-thumbed Bible, a gift to her as a teenager in Jamaica.By his own admission a “perfectionist” as a photographer, Grover scoured the south London streets in search of one of the famed “front rooms” and found one in Brixton. Once a part of every Jamaican home, front rooms typically contained framed family photographs, a picture of Jesus walking on water, sofas covered in protective plastic, leopardskin rugs and bouquets of artificial flowers. Often, a gold, plastic model of Big Ben or some other shooting-gallery prize graced a giant cocktail cabinet with a Formica top. The rooms are nearly all gone now. “They speak of a bygone era,” says Grover. “Sadly, to the second- and third-generations they’re just clutter.” Towards the end of his project, Grover was invited to photograph a Friday “open house” typical of Caribbean life. In the Brixton home of Hermine Grocia, as many as four generations gather each week for food, chat, a quiz or a game of Scrabble. “I wasn’t even sure I had space for it in the exhibition,” he says, “but I am so pleased to have spent the evening with Hermine and 21 of her family. It was so moving to see this wonderful family be so loving, relaxed and connected… they get together every Friday. It was the last thing I shot, and it ended the project for me on such a high.”Hermine met her future husband, Lester, on the Kingston wharf in 1959, just as they were about to sail for “Missus Queen’s” country. Like most of the Windrush generation, she had come to the UK determined to work. Grover’s moving and often beautiful photographs show the other side of the current Windrush scandal: they celebrate a community and a generation that contributed immeasurably to our cultural life.“The more I immersed myself in this project,” Grover says, “the more I realised that I was capturing living history. As this generation passes away, and the successive generations pursue their own lives here, some of these traditions will inevitably weaken. It felt imperative to document this way of life and to record these stories before it becomes too late.”Windrush: Portrait of a Generation is at gallery@Oxo, Oxo Tower Wharf, London SE1, 23 May-10 June.

There were around 1,000 amusement arcades in the UK in the 1980s, but that number had halved by 2011, according to the amusements industry trade body, Bacta.Now, the next generation of gaming – virtual reality – is once again making the arcade the prime venue for playing cutting-edge games.Back at the inception of gaming, fans went to video-game arcades. Japanese coin-operated games like Out Run and Street Fighter managed to draw in players once Pac-Man and Donkey Kong fell away, but they could not beat increasingly impressive home consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation, which came along in the mid-90s, and Microsoft’s Xbox at the turn of the century.Seaside arcades have clung on as “family entertainment centres” or “mixed entertainment facilities”, full of games aimed at small children alongside rides and attractions.However, VR Star in Bristol is one of several hundred virtual reality arcades around the UK that are persuading gamers to quit their homes for the high street. They mirror a global trend for dedicated “VRcades” springing up in the US, Japan, South Korea and China. With 380 such dedicated venues now operating around the world, could VR offer the arcade a route back in the shape of so-called “destination gaming”?While it’s possible to buy budget technology, good quality VR is expensive. HTC’s Vive headset is available for around £599 in the UK, but to function effectively it requires a computer with serious processing power and a high quality graphics card, raising the bar to thousands of pounds. Even then you’re not tapping the full potential of VR gaming.The driving simulators and shoot-em-ups in VR Star Bristol are further brought to life with motion sensors and high-quality sound, taking the experience to another level. The 360-degree visuals and depth of field take on another dimension when paired with hydraulics and tilting floors. LA-based Dreamscape Immersive’s Alien Zoo experience even uses wind machines to add to the sensation of movement.“To get the full experience, VR needs what we call SiSoMo: sight, sound and motion,” says Martin Higginson, the executive chairman of British developer Immotion, which owns VR Star. “If you want a truly immersive experience you need high-end components, and for that reason VR will be an out-of-home experience for some years. I’ve spent most of my life in digital media and it is the most exciting thing\u0026nbspyet.”Situated in a modest space in Cabot Circus shopping centre, VR Star was launched to test the waters in mid-December. By the beginning of March, it had admitted 4,000 customers, paying £30 an hour.The enthusiastic response has encouraged the company to open four more venues in Swindon, Cardiff, Manchester and Leeds. A total of 60 VR Stars are planned around the country, along with units in existing arcades and custom-made rides for brands such as Legoland. Just before Christmas, Immotion announced a £1.3m investment to launch its platforms in Europe and the US.The units in VR Star play games from a Chinese developer but Immotion intends to run its own titles following last year’s acquisition of Studio Liddell, a Manchester-based animation producer.Experts say VR has come at the right time for the arcade business. “Arcades have always had lifecycles reflecting changing innovation,” says Devi Kolli, the head of VR equipment firm AiSolve. “They can’t survive the way they are without reinventing themselves with cutting-edge technology, and we are part of that. The response to VR so far suggests the market is hungry for good products.”If they are prepared to invest in the new generation of VR, existing arcades could enjoy a return to prominence as gaming destinations, though they will have to compete with dedicated spaces like VR Star.Jeremy Dalton, a VR consultant at PwC, is more positive. He says the complexity of setting up VR experiences offers an ideal chance for arcades. “The set-up issues with VR provides a perfect opportunity for third parties ... and that’s gaming arcades. You just hand over your money and enjoy the ride.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"identity politics veered ideals kimberly foster","story":"A misuse of identity is not just a conservative problem – it affects well-meaning people on the left, tooIdentity politics have become a convenient scapegoat for the deepening political isions in the United States. Though evidence for the claim is thin, detractors blame Hillary Clinton’s presidential loss on her choice to provide a platform for discussions of identity and inequality during her campaign.In the months leading up to 8 November 2016, Clinton differentiated herself from her opponent by becoming the candidate who cared about America’s underserved groups: women, immigrants, the LGBTQ community, black and Latino voters, and the many people whose identities  multiple categories. Her supporters rallied behind the Big Tent slogan: “Love Trumps Hate.” But on election day, it did not. In an interview with 60 Minutes last fall, Steve Bannon, the former chief strategist for the White House and chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, warned, “The longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em.”A skittish left might view Bannon’s words as an imminent threat. But identity politics are not to be feared. Their effectiveness as a progressive political strategy, however, is undermined by their misuse.When a group of black feminists called the Combahee River Collective coined the phrase “identity politics” in 1977, they imagined that the “seemingly personal experiences of inidual Black women’s lives” would provide the foundation for a politics that is “actively committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression”. Their ideology began with self, but it was not self-obsessed. Ultimately, they knew their work would benefit everyone.Since then, identity politics have veered away from Combahee’s foundational ideals. We should return to them, not to appease the right wing but to reaffirm the importance of a progressivism that touts liberty and justice for all. Identity politics become flimsy when they devolve into shallow back-and-forths that conflate lived experience with sound political analysis. A worldview that moves us closer to equality doesn’t stem from living in a certain kind of body. It emerges from pursuing a certain kind of politics.When identities can be invoked to assert an unquestionable authority, marginalized people can get by making dubious or completely false claims because of their “lived experience”.As secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, has endorsed delays of anti-discrimination regulation in housing and called poverty “a state of mind”. Carson, himself, grew up impoverished in Detroit. He documented his journey to becoming a renowned neurosurgeon in a widely read autobiography, Gifted Hands. Because of his personal story, Carson is held up, by himself and his supporters, as a testament to the supreme importance of hard work. But the belief that grit is the key to escaping poverty is contradicted by decades of social science research. Poverty persists because of a crumbling social safety net not a culture of dependency.Carson’s anecdotes are compelling, in part, because our lives do matter. Marginalized people gain a unique insight into systemic inequality because we face it every day. For too long those stories have been doubted or dismissed by claims that only an “objective” or “dispassionate” viewpoint can be trusted.But lived experience is one form of knowledge that should be considered alongside others, and stories are most useful when assessed within a broader context of structural inequity. The Combahee River Collective argued that one’s political consciousness colors how one will interpret life events thus, similar experiences can lead similarly situated people to draw ergent conclusions. For example, every black American who grew up like Carson and went on to be successful will not share his views. In fact, based on the racial makeup of the Republican party, most do not. So sweeping generalizations about the lives of oppressed people that are backed up only by stories of iniduals should always be interrogated because so many of those conclusions collapse when examined more closely.A misuse of identity is not just a conservative problem. In the #MeToo era, women are empowered to call on their experiences with bias and sexual assault and create change within industries that facilitate abuse. But those traumas are not a pass for women to avoid difficult questions about the substance of their activism. Actor Rose McGowan emerged as a sexual assault activist in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal that upended Hollywood’s silence on the mistreatment of actresses. When a trans woman confronted McGowan about her past transphobic comments at a book event, she responded angrily. On Twitter she charged that the audience and her staff failed to protect her during the exchange, and she refused to apologize for the statements. Instead, the actor-turned-author cancelled the rest of the book tour. Though McGowan’s identities as a woman and a victim of sexual assault are central to her activism, using them to shut down criticism is unproductive for the movement she advocates. Trans women are also victims of discrimination in employment, housing and healthcare, and an inclusive feminism must invest itself in recognizing all who are vulnerable. These sorts of oversights are easily correctable if acknowledged, but treating identities as credentials discourages critical self-reflection.Thoughtful conversations and meaningful activism require a measure of openness that the current paradigms for identity politics don’t always allow. We have to make sure that our exchanges do not reproduce oppressive power dynamics, but every challenge is not oppressive. An identity politics that is not principally concerned with dismantling all forms of inequality quickly devolves into a never-ending game of oneupmanship where self-satisfaction is all that’s won.For marginalized people, our power comes from seeing identity as a starting point, not the end.

It begins filming next year.“It’s a series I’ve wanted to make for a long time because I think the porn industry is a really interesting environment through which to look at power and how we behave in the workplace,” Kirkwood told the Observer. “It’s not a simple subject and I found the grey areas, such as the fact that it’s one of the few workplaces where women earn more than men and one of the few industries that allows women to juggle work and childcare demands, really fascinating.”Jolene is a mother of three who has built a two-decade career in the industry. “She’s not quite Jenna Jameson, but she has a following,” Kirkwood explained, referring to the prolific American star known as “the queen of porn”. Jolene finds her world turned upside down after coming into contact with a younger woman, Amy, an aspiring dancer who turns to porn while recovering from an injury.“I wanted to look at the way the industry has changed in recent years – there’s a very high turnover of actors working very intensely over a short period now, and that obviously has had a seismic effect,” Kirkwood said. “Jolene considers herself a very maternal person, not only to her own children but also in the way she looks after other women on set, and one of the things that the series considers is how women take care of other women and the culture of complicity and silence that can occur. What it means if you fail to stand up for someone or listen to them when they tell you what has occurred.“It’s also not a straightforward series. The quality of writing on television these days means that you can’t deal in cardboard cutouts. I wanted people to be sympathetic to these characters, but for questions to also be raised.”Kirkwood, whose plays Chimerica and The Children have won multiple awards, researched the subject by talking to industry performers and directors as well as feminist anti-porn campaigners. The writer has a reputation for tackling difficult subjects, from geopolitics and particle physics to sex trafficking, and stressed that the industry’s darker side wouldn’t be ignored. “It’s a subject about which I have all manner of feelings,” she said. “It’s easy to just get angry about porn and the way in which it affects lives, but I don’t think it’s very helpful to simply dismiss another woman’s lived experience in that way.“It’s one thing to sit in a bar and argue abstractly about how porn affects us and quite another to talk to a woman whose life this is. I wanted to look at that sympathetically but not softly. I don’t think this is a subject that you can simply take a single strident position on. There’s a lot to be said about how porn is the product of a capitalist mindset and will always have people who, out of necessity or out of choice, are willing to provide it.”The series is sure to draw comparisons with The Deuce, a period piece by David Simon, the creator of The Wire, about the growth of the porn industry in New York in the 70s, although Kirkwood stressed that she had a slightly different focus in mind.“I really admire the way in which The Deuce focuses on the economy and the way in which it drives the porn industry and it’s interesting how little has really changed in the most basic sense once you remove the changes in technology,” she said. “But in some senses comparing the British porn industry to the American porn industry is like comparing the British film industry to Hollywood. There’s a sense that it’s less mechanised and more of a cottage industry in Britain and I wanted to reflect that.”Most of all though she hopes that Adult Material will force audiences to look at the industry in a fresh way. “It’s a story about women navigating their way through a difficult and constantly changing world and I hope that if anyone is dismissive of porn actresses at the beginning then they will reconsider that by the end,” she said. “What I would love is for everyone to feel that the industry has been fairly represented, but also that watching it you have been pushed into areas that you might not always want to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a35926c08e4137460045c2f3d6345f19d5ba781/0_15_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ca8f89aa198e16770b95090c1bb7991 940w","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons.

By Emma BrockesSean Penn walks into a low-key restaurant not far from his house and slides undetected into a seat at the back. It is a misty day in Malibu, 15 miles north of LA, and the actor appears in familiar, I-don’t-care guise: beat-up leather jacket, brushfire hair (which, in light of the views he will air about female vanity in Hollywood, I feel bound to report may be more vibrant than nature intended), with the jittery energy of a man who has stood for too long next to very loud speakers. The 57-year-old greets me affably, to my surprise: while Penn may be long admired for his acting, he is denigrated for almost everything else. He is known to be pugnacious, short-tempered, long-winded, a man who yells at photographers and smokes on TV. And now he has written a lunatic novel. “It’s the most fun I’ve had professionally,” he croaks and leans back in his chair.A few days before our meeting, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff was the subject of a full-page newspaper ad in which the publishers, rather cleverly, ran lines from the book’s worst reviews and asked readers to make up their own minds. The novel, which follows the adventures of its eponymous hero as he goes around selling septic tanks and murdering old people, is a satire of American consumer culture and the cult of image, and for weeks its excesses have been gleefully documented. Penn writes as if every word has been put through a thesaurus: for “face”, read “dermal mask” for “quiet”, “lingering symphony of silence” a man with good hearing has “extraordinary auditory augmentation efficiency”. So it goes on, until we reach: “Effervescence lived in her every cellular expression, and she had spizzerinctum to spare.”Was he edited?“He wasn’t looking to change anything,” Penn says cheerfully. “But he did send me great notes which said, ‘I don’t understand this. Do you want me to?’” (In most cases Penn replied “yes” in some, “not so much”.) The suggestion he was indulged because of his celebrity is one he finds baffling. “No, because I wouldn’t have done it any other way. When people listen to the advice they get, it usually robs the soul of the piece. In the movies, they’re not thinking about whether it has impact on them they’re thinking about whether it will impact the box office.”This rather quaint view of publishing – as an industry devoid of commercial principles and certainly not the kind of business that might judge a book by a famous actor to have greater value as a car crash than as something more credible – is the main source of Penn’s enthusiasm for novel writing, which he sees as a less mediated form of expression than acting. But why would he trade in something he is indisputably world class at – Penn has won two Oscars, for Milk and Mystic River – for something he is indisputably not? The answer is burnout, what he calls “my great source of alienation from my peers, actors who would rather sell a movie than make one”. Where these actors are “brands”, and where even a movie he loves “is the sum of compromises at its best”, Bob Honey, by contrast, is “all mine. It’s been said you never complete a film, you abandon it, and I didn’t abandon this. I stand by every line exactly how I wrote it.”Has he seen the worst reviews? “I have a sense of them. It’s keep-your-day-job shit. A bunch of children, schadenfreude, whatever. And in the end, some of the best laughs I’ve got have been the one-liners that have come out of the worst reviews.”Through long espousal of leftwing politics, including vocal protests against the Iraq war and support of Hugo Chávez and Raúl Castro, Penn is used to being unpopular. Does it hurt to be mocked? “Well, mocked means the person’s an idiot.” Penn smiles crookedly and shutters his lids. “I’m not vulnerable at all.”There are two images of Sean Penn that rival the memory of his greatest screen roles. Up there with Carlito’s Way, or Dead Man Walking, or his role as Harvey Milk – the 2008 biopic of California’s first gay elected official and a performance for which one could almost forgive Penn any amount of bad behaviour off-screen – there is the shot of him in a boat rescuing survivors of Hurricane Katrina, and the one of his handshake with Mexican drug lord El Chapo.The gung-ho activism is more complicated and, on closer inspection, much more admirable than the caricature suggests. If there is precedent for Penn wading into a job about which he knows nothing and nailing it through sheer bloody-mindedness, it is here, in his experiences with aid.In 2010, Penn went to Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake and set up the JP Haitian Relief Organization, an agency that has, by all accounts, been enormously successful and helped thousands of Haitians find shelter and medical relief. In a piece in the New York Times in 2011, by which time Penn had been in Haiti for almost a year, veteran aid workers lined up to praise him. The question of what he was doing in Haiti in the first place has roots in his inability to find equilibrium at home. The most persuasive passages in Bob Honey are those in which Penn writes of his character’s insomnia. When I ask if this comes from experience, he takes a big breath. “So this goes back as far as I, or my mother, can remember. I was born at 3.45am and I generally fall asleep at 3.45am. I’ve been to Zen centres, done sleep studies, everything. I could never get myself to go to sleep. I’d get up, sometimes, with no sleep at all. And I was getting older, so I wasn’t able to push through this thing mentally.” Eventually a doctor prescribed Ambien: “But it doesn’t work like it used to. It doesn’t keep me asleep, but I get to sleep and at least get three hours. Then you’re watching the clock for the time you have to get up, and it’s getting closer and closer.”Some of Penn’s wilder behaviour makes more sense, perhaps, when looked at in the context of a man who has never had more than three unbroken hours’ sleep.“Yuh. Judgment issues,” he says, raising his eyebrows in what is almost certainly a reference to the time, in 2009, when a court made him attend anger management classes after an altercation with a photographer.It probably didn’t improve your temper, I suggest.“No. Nor the thoughts that lead to a temperamental response.”One result of this is that Penn often feels himself to operate best in crisis mode. He quotes a line from Cutter’s Way, a movie from 1981 starring Jeff Bridges and John Heard in which a woman kills herself to get away from her alcoholic husband, and the final line of which is: “You know, the routine grind drives me to drink. Tragedy, I take straight.”“There’s been a lot of that in my life,” Penn says and he relates it, obliquely, to how he is able to function effectively in a destabilised environment such as Haiti after the earthquake. “I think tragedy can also be urgency. I find myself going calm, and being demanding. I can bring an American arrogance to anywhere in the world.” He smiles. “Look, in the movie business you tell your crew: ‘I need this set done yesterday.’ When I got to Haiti and I saw how NGOs worked, it would be like: ‘This patient needs this, now, and this is the person to get in touch with.’ Then I had six other people asking me six other things. When I circled back half an hour later to the first one and said, ‘Did you get it?’ they said, ‘We’re waiting for a response, we sent an email.’ I said, ‘You sent an email? Give me your phone, I’m going to call.’ And it drove me fucking mad.”Pretty quickly, Penn’s outfit became known as an agency that got things done quicker than the NGOs and he calls it “the easiest kind of work to do in an emergency, because it’s emergency related”. It was triage. He nods. “It’s the easiest, commonsense work. There’s a kid in the street, a truck’s going to hit it, do you know that the sidewalk is clear of paedophiles? No. I’ll make my apologies later.”It is fascinating that the self-important urgency of a Hollywood movie set can be translated to a disaster zone, but think about it, Penn says: “It’s the same business, the stakes are higher.” There’s even overlap with the sanitation logistics of shooting a movie. “You’ve gotta get porta potties for people.”Was he surprised when allegations were made last year that aid workers, including Roland Van Hauwermeiren, the head of Oxfam in Haiti, used sex workers? “I don’t know why it wasn’t a bigger scandal earlier. I was reading about it in the Haitian press when I was in Haiti in the beginning. Roland Van Hauwermeiren was probably the best country director of an organisation there. Of course, you’re not the best anything if you’re looking the other way on that stuff. Or, worse yet, if you’re participating.”In his own organisation, Penn had a policy of “no tolerance” right down to the rule that “if you smoke one joint, you’re fired”. In fact he ended up relaxing the drugs rule for his indigenous workers, because “how am I controlling that when my local workers went back to their homes at night? I stopped being an idiot with that.” For the imports, mostly Americans or Brits, however, “You don’t come to this country to break its laws.”And when someone in his organisation did break a rule? Well, Penn says, “There’s no organisation, including my own, where you don’t have something happen. And you deal with it you certainly want to take it transparent.” The cover-up, he says, is the biggest problem. “I’ve known of situations where big organisations discovered something and did an investigation, and fired somebody – and because they didn’t want a lawsuit from that person, another organisation would hire them it’s like passing on priests. In our organisation, I’d get on the phone to whoever the violator was and say, ‘If I hear you are ever trying to get a job in one of these organisations, I’m coming to your home town, and I’m going to rent out the movie theatre and show a documentary about you and make sure your parents are there.’”Why does he think an aid worker, who presumably starts out with good intentions, gets to the point of exploiting desperate women this way? “I can have theories,” Penn says, “but they’re the same theories one would apply to someone who abuses their children. How do you do that?”In light of these life-or-death stakes, Penn is unsympathetic to what he seems to regard as more trivial abuses closer to home, particularly those involving celebrity exposure. A week before we meet, he appeared in the gossip columns for dining with Charlie Rose, the disgraced former TV host fired from PBS and CBS for inappropriate behaviour around female staff. Penn is not, it is safe to say, on board with #MeToo, which he describes as “not intellectually honest”, “a movement led by mania” and full of “self-aggrandisement and venting”. At the end of Bob Honey, he writes a poem defending Charlie Rose and appearing to lament the demise of Louis CK.Clearly, I say, Penn thinks his friend was mistreated.“He says one thing happened other people said another thing happened. I wasn’t there. What I do think is we maybe should be very careful for example, are we now going to say we will never celebrate Thomas Jefferson again: slave holder, that’s all you are? Charlie Rose provided one of the only sophisticated dialogue programmes, and I don’t know what the percentages are, but I know that there are some lies that have been told publicly about people I know of some serious omissions. I’m talking about women towards men.” This is a personal issue for Penn, who in 2016 won a court-appointed apology from the director Lee Daniels, who erroneously implied the actor was guilty of domestic violence.Romantic relationships don’t seem to be Penn’s strong point. The worst bits of Bob Honey are those involving the character’s ex-wife, a harridan called Helen, about whom he is so vicious, I had wondered whether Penn’s own ex-wife might have commented on it. Penn gives me a dry look. “Which ex-wife?” he says.Oh. I had momentarily forgotten about Madonna, to whom Penn was married from 1985 to 1989. “The mother of your kids,” I say. (Penn and Robin Wright, who were married for 14 years, have Dylan and Hopper, both in their 20s.)“No these characters are amalgamations of a lot of things and she’s not a character in the book.” Penn pauses. “I don’t think the book would be either one of my ex-wives’ cup of tea. They both thought that I talked too much in ways that were too complicated.” He laughs. “I don’t have a lot of conversations with my most recent ex, but my first ex, we have a close friendship.”What does he think Madonna would say about the book? “I think if she was reading it, she’d say, ugh, I’ll read this some other time.”Anyway, Penn says, returning to the subject of #MeToo, “I don’t ever want to be in a movement. I don’t trust any movement. The anti-war movement did not sustain. We’re back in wars.”There is a libertarian streak in Penn that is impossible to miss. I repeat a wince-making line from Bob Honey, which Penn almost certainly considers to be a liberal statement: “Getting older in America is tough on a woman seeing what she’ll do to avoid it is tough on a man.” I assume Penn approved of Frances McDormand’s unadorned style at the Oscars this year?He takes a big breath: “When my kids were growing up, there was a thing called the surgery channel and I would watch this thing and get into hysterical laughter. One slice and you’re a human body! We’re the fucking same! But where I really became a giggling 12-year-old girl was volunteering for cosmetic surgery: you have someone who’s anaesthetised, and they’re doing the most vile things to them, and I would get so hysterical. You bring up Frances McDormand. What do you do to be more beautiful than that? That fucking woman walks into a room and you don’t know if you want to kiss her, eat her farts or bite her toes off, you just want to be around that energy.” As opposed, he says, to “the vanity that errs on the side of violence against oneself, physical violence. It’s crazy.”Does he understand why his countrymen voted for Trump?“I have a pretty good idea. We became celebritised,” he says. “I don’t buy People magazine. But when people complain that someone took a picture of them or that their privacy is being invaded, I’m like, yeah? Fuck you. I just spent my entire adult life with you telling me that because I want to express myself as an actor, that that comes with the territory. Well, it comes with the territory for you, now, and you bought those fucking People magazines. You made that happen.” He is jabbing his finger at me across the table. “When I go like this, I’m not at my best,” he says. “So two sides that are not at their best, it gets very shallow.” Penn has a disdain for the idea of the personal brand. “Branding is being! Branding is being! The algorithm of modern binary existentialism,” he writes in Bob Honey, a line I read out to him now.“Yeah,” says Penn, lowering his eyes and looking sage.What does “the algorithm of modern binary existentialism” mean? He snaps his eyes open. “Well. Binary – two components. When you’re taking an algorithm that’s going to identify the two components, and, there are, I think I talk about in the book also… it’s America today.” There follows a long story about how easy it is to buy components for a bomb in the US.“I’ve just gone off on the word binary. But I think it’s self-explanatory, in there. Huh.”Anyway, he says, the reason people voted for Trump is “because I think there’s a mental health problem in this country. It’s rage over reason. There’s a lot going on that was going on in Nazi Germany we’re finding scapegoats, groups to hate, whether it be of a race, or so-called lefty Hollywood, so that’s part of why I want to write something – I only have my sense of humour to offer. I didn’t want to just be angry all the time.”And he isn’t. There is an underlying humour to Penn’s rants that is often lost in translation and while I find much of what he says preposterous, arrogant and occasionally delusional, to my surprise, I also find him likable and funny – a genuine American eccentric.As we get up to leave, I can’t help laughing. “Sorry. I keep thinking about the fact that Madonna thought you were boring.”“I love her,” Penn says, and laughs. Is she a good egg? “Such a good egg.”We go outside to his pick-up truck and he introduces me to Flyboy, his six-month-old golden retriever. After Penn has gone, I call a friend with a degree in philosophy. “Does ‘the algorithm of modern binary existentialism’ mean anything?” I ask. After the laughter has died down, he says, “I think he means… in modern life everything is black and white. But existentialism refers to a specific tradition in philosophy he surely just means existence.” No matter Penn has a lot more to say. Before leaving he told me: he is hard at work on Bob Honey, the sequel. • Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff by Sean Penn is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster at £14.99.

This was a rematch of the 2016 final, which the Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said the Blues “didn’t turn up for”, when a curling Danielle Carter strike won Arsenal the trophy. This time Chelsea did show up and a goal from Vivianne Miedema to reduce the deficit to 2-1 wasn’t enough to turn the game for Arsenal.The opening chances fell to Arsenal. Three minutes in Beth Mead was able to break free on the left, her teasing ball into the box was poked clear before it could reach a red shirt. Seconds later, Jordan Nobbs played an almost identical ball in, this time from the right, but Maren Mjelde got herself in front of a waiting Miedema.However the opportunities started to even out, both sides were nursing hangovers but neither seemed to be letting that get to them. Arsenal had suffered their first defeat in 14 games when they crumbled at Birmingham last Sunday – Ellen White’s hat-trick breaking a Gunners backline that had only conceded five goals since Joe Montemurro took charge in October. Meanwhile Chelsea, still unbeaten in the league but having slipped behind Manchester City on goal difference, missed out on a first Champions League final after a 5-1 aggregate loss to Wolfsburg.The Blues’ first chances fell to the PFA and FWA player of the year, Fran Kirby. Twice in quick succession the England striker picked up the ball on the left and danced past three tight Arsenal players but her square passes was easily crowded out.Shortly after that Ramona Bachmann and Ji So-yun played a one-two on the edge of the Arsenal box, the Swiss forward spinning\u0026nbspbeautifully but shooting wide of the far post. The chances didn’t stop for the Gunners and the best of the half\u0026nbspcame as a delightful ball over the\u0026nbsptop put Beth Mead through on goal with just Hedvig Lindahl to beat but a sprinting Mjelde chased her down before she could get a shot\u0026nbspaway.As the clock ticked towards half time Chelsea began to ramp up the pressure a little. Kirby again got the better of Lisa Evans but her shot was tame and straight at Sari van Veenendaal, while Ji and Bachmann\u0026nbspcontinued to combine well on the right. Ji’s free-kick from the edge of the penalty area went straight into the wall and her effort on the rebound was collected by Van\u0026nbspVeenendaal. A minute later Bachmann slipped the ball to an onrushing Ji whose powerful shot just over the bar was the last action of the half.Chelsea began the second period as they ended the first, and it did not take long for them to break the deadlock. Bachmann and Ji combined again, this time getting Kirby involved, who fed the ball back to Bachmann and the forward to blasted high into Van Veenendaal’s net. Undeterred by falling behind, Lindahl was forced to palm the ball away from Mead. Five minutes later the Gunners captain, Kim Little, who has won the cup three times with her club, played a pinpoint pass to Miedema, who perhaps should have shot first time but turned and gave the Blues time to rush back.The Gunners’ wastefulness in front of goal was then punished by Bachmann again. Her shot from the right deflected off the 21-year-old defender Leah Williamson to loop over Van Veenendaal and take Chelsea into a 2-0 lead.From then the game began to slow, Chelsea happy to sit back and Arsenal searching for a way to break through a defence that had not conceded in the competition. But the pressure eventually paid off, Mead’s cross into the box finding Miedema and this time the Euro 2017 winner did not wait, sweeping the ball past Lindahl to halve the deficit.But just one minute after Arsenal had seemingly opened the game back up, Kirby picked up the ball on the edge of the Arsenal box, stepped past Louise Quinn and fired home to deal a hammer-blow to the Gunners. It was her sixth FA Cup goal this season and it secured Chelsea the trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e2a8229f28b7310f795ef97f212133dc69e080/96_0_3078_1847/master/3078.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e9ec66657b0ef54fda945b48f69539","title":"everton southampton premier league match report","story":"Southampton were denied a huge step towards Premier League survival when Everton prevented a second successive league victory under Mark Hughes through a last-gasp equaliser from Tom Davies. The visitors must have thought they had done enough to win, with Nathan Redmond even bringing a late save from Jordan Pickford when Southampton had been reduced to 10 men, but when Ryan Bertrand gave the ball away with just seconds remaining Davies crashed in a shot from Idrissa Gueye’s square ball via a deflection off Wesley Hoedt.The only consolation for Southampton is that they still managed to move out of the bottom three and above Swansea, going into the all-important meeting in South Wales on Tuesday. There was also another reprieve for West Brom, who would have been relegated by a Southampton victory, but little respite for Sam Allardyce. Though Everton have been safe for some time their manager’s position is looking increasingly precarious. Allardyce was hoping to use this game to leave Everton fans feeling positive over the summer, and it is doubtful whether Davies’s late rescue act will have quite that effect.Hughes was furious at the end because Jon Moss awarded a free-kick against Redmond for an offence no one else had seen, then allowed Everton to take it from the wrong place. Not what you need when you are shorthanded and trying to cling on for dear life. “Jon Moss was 30 yards behind the play, as he usually is,” the Southampton manager said. “He gave a free-kick that shouldn’t have been. At least we took something from the game. Everton had to change their shape to match us and we were still better at it than they were. We got everything right in the game until the final few moments, and we didn’t get any help from the officials.”Davies showed willing in the opening minutes with a shot from the edge of the area that was not too far off the target, though Everton failed to keep up anything like the same urgency. Cenk Tosun headed over the bar with a difficult chance from a Séamus Coleman cross but that was about it for home attempts on goal in the first half and Allardyce was soon in his technical area gesturing furiously for his side to get men further forward.Southampton were the first side to bring a save from a goalkeeper, and a very good one it was too from Pickford, whose reactions did not let him down when Charlie Austin sent in a volley on target with little warning after the ball came his way off Michael Keane. By the half-hour mark Southampton were looking the more likely to make a breakthrough and Everton were glad Phil Jagielka was in the right position to make a timely interception when the ball came through to Oriol Romeu in front of goal.To say the game was low on incident and excitement would be a considerable understatement. The home side departed to boos at half-time, though that has become par for the course in recent weeks. Even when Everton won at Huddersfield last week there was still dissatisfaction expressed at the style of football being played under Allardyce. Or perhaps just the continued presence of Allardyce. The school of science, it is being said by some unhappy supporters, is presently in special measures.Allardyce is impervious to that sort of background noise, of course, and as a half-time flourish to mark the end of his first season at Goodison he brought on Ramiro Funes Mori for Yannick Bolasie and switched to a back three. He does not exactly court popularity, though something needed to change and after an anonymous first half the winger could hardly complain.Southampton also made a change, Redmond replacing the ineffective Mario Lemina, and 10 minutes after the restart it was Hughes looking smug on the sideline. Dusan Tadic and Cédric Soares found space on the Everton left behind the now advanced Leighton Baines – always the drawback with wing-backs – and from the latter’s precise cross Redmond arrived in the area to beat Pickford with a firm downward header. Cue joy in the small corner of the Bullens Road stand that was red and white and more boos from the blue majority.The visitors were forced to see out the last five minutes with 10 men after Maya Yoshida picked up a second yellow for a foul on Oumar Niasse. Baines brought a brilliant fingertip save from Alex McCarthy with a stoppage-time free-kick but time was running out when Bertrand made his mistake and invited Everton to claim a point they barely merited. That may sound harsh but Allardyce himself admitted it. “We nicked a point we didn’t deserve,” the Everton manager said. “It’s disappointing but we have made overall progress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bbc7cc9afad10d8d6e99c76e2bdd765129d3ce9/0_81_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f77ee4237efe61041fe0a387c36c55e","title":"west brom tottenham premier league match report","story":"A sensational last-gasp escape from relegation remains possible for West Brom thanks to Jake Livermore’s stoppage time winner. If other results go in their favour – they need Swansea and Southampton to draw on Tuesday for a start – then victory at Crystal Palace next Sunday could secure their survival.That outcome seemed utterly implausible when Darren Moore stepped into the vacancy left by the dismissal of Alan Pardew last month but Moore has transformed the team’s fortunes, inspiring a run of three wins and two draws from his five matches at the helm. No wonder the crowd clamoured here for him to be appointed on a permanent basis.As the clock ticked past 90 minutes West Brom were on course to prolong Moore’s unbeaten record but his team knew anything less than a win would lead to demotion on the spot. So there was an explosion of joy all around the Hawthorns when Livermore forced the ball over Spurs’ line from close range following an almighty scramble after a corner by Matt Phillips.All around the ground except in the visiting dugout, that is, as Mauricio Pochettino was left to lament the “lack of ambition” shown by his team throughout a match from which they seemed to expect a comfortable win. No such criticism could be directed at Moore’s side.Spurs, aiming to consolidate their place in the top four and maintain their notional chance of leapfrogging Manchester United into second place, began as if their victory was as inevitable as the hosts’ relegation was supposed to be. They set up camp in West Brom’s half and waited for an opening to present itself, hogged possession but were ponderous. Unable to create early on, Tottenham seemed in need of unwitting assistance from their opponents. But, unlike during most of the campaign, West Brom did not oblige. They defended steadfastly.Not until the 24th minute did Spurs even attempt a shot. It was a good one, Victor Wanyama’s curling effort from 20 yards forcing Ben Foster to tip over the bar. Danny Rose tried something similar one minute later but sent the ball into the stands.Kieran Trippier produced the first really incisive pass of the game, sliding in Harry Kane on the half-hour. Foster rushed off his line and erted the striker’s shot from eight yards behind for a corner. From the set piece Spurs worked the ball to Christian Eriksen, whose cross from the left found Kane. But the striker could not steer a header on target.West Brom’s rope-a-dope strategy nearly paid off before the break. Chris Brunt’s long free-kick into the box in the 41st minute ran all the way to Jay Rodriguez, who dabbed the ball across the face of goal. Toby Alderweireld headed it out for a corner before any home player could pounce. But three minutes later West Brom almost took the lead from another corner, only for Ahmed Hegazi to nod wide from six yards.Spurs were nearly caught out within moments of the resumption after half-time, as Phillips glided down the right and crossed for Salomón Rondón but the striker missed his kick from close range.West Brom grew bolder as the finale drew closer. “We knew we had to contain them early on and the pendulum started to swing around the 60th minute,” said Moore. “We just had the trust and belief that we would get a goal.”As West Brom applied more pressure Kane became so spooked that he almost slicked a cross into his own net. Hugo Lloris had to make a brilliant save to prevent the England striker from being credited with a goal that he would not have wanted to claim.The one West Brom craved came in stoppage time, Livermore stabbing the ball into the net from inches out after Lloris parried a close-range header by Craig Dawson. When the final whistle went, players who have been booed off many times this season were acclaimed by the Hawthorns crowd. Fans made it clear they want Moore to remain at the helm for next season no matter the league they play in.“There’s been some pride restored,” said Moore. “The feelgood factor is back around the community and club. I feel from the support that there is a real good energy in the club again and that’s all anybody would really want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/579376cff0c5a737dd480cceeb6678f10759056d/73_87_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f198748d38bb113a40ec3260a4b4159","title":"everton v southampton premier league live","story":"Tom Davies’ injury-time goal denied Southampton a vital three points in their battle against relegationOk, that concludes that. Thanks for joining us. Here’s the match report from Paul Wilson. We clearly haven’t got what we deserve. I put that at the door of the referee. He’s given them a free-kick and allowed it to be taken from a false position. He’s given free-kicks when out guys haven’t been touched. To say we are aggrieved is an understatement. I thought we were magnificent today. It’s a huge game with Swansea and that will probably decide who goes down. We have done everything right apart from the last moment. I am really upset with the officials. Come Tuesday, we’ll go again.Nathan Redmond, man of the match speaks, and is complaining about the free-kick he conceded and led to the equaliser. Matters at Wembley were a little more clearcut. So, it’s all on Southampton v Swansea on Tuesday. Three points at Goodison would have bought breathing space. Not now, and Hughes has to lift the spirits of a team denied at the death in the most demoralising way possible.Mark Hughes had a word with Jon Moss about his timekeeping, a stern word, in fact. Meanwhile, Everton’s lap of appreciation will take place in front of an empty stadium. Perhaps they can clap each other. Southampton did what they did last week against Bournemouth and panicked as they tried to hold on to their lead. This time, they were unlucky, but paid for their caution and some rash decisions. Yoshida’s dismissal put them on the back foot, and somehow Everton got something from a game they barely competed in for much of the game.Boos from the home fans, despair for the Saints fans and a full minute after the allotted time added on. West Brom, meanwhile, are still breathing. Amazing stuff. Oh my! Tom Davies’ shot took an awful deflection off Hoedt. Saints failed to clear their lines and paid the price. 94 mins: Into the last knockings now. McCarthy flaps at the ball. 94 mins: Pandemonium mounts but Hoedt bought time in the corner.93 mins: A great free-kick and an even better save from Alex McCarthy.92 mins: In the stands, the boos are beginning to coagulate into rebellion. Hoedt’s foul gives away a free-kick and Leighton Baines will hit it. 91 mins: A break in play as Cedric goes down injured gives Southampton chance to regroup.90 mins: Klaassen takes the ball down and shoots. Illegally, says the referee. There will be four minutes of added time. 89 mins: Added time approaches. 88 mins: Southampton again smuggle the ball clear, and it’s Redmond who carries it. This time, though, Everton come forward. Klaassen is trying his best to get involved, but his team-mates’ movement is sluggish.87 mins: Redmond is the man of this match, easily the best attacking player on show, and as the first half barely occurred, it doesn’t matter that he only came on at half-time. 85 mins: Nathan Redmond, on his own again, forces another Pickford save. A second yellow after a loose challenge. And Southampton will have to retreat even further back.83 mins: Ward-Prowse takes on a free-kick. Pickford saves.82 mins: Meanwhile, in the stands, Everton fans are asking Sam Allardyce to go forth and multiply. Hearts and minds not completely won over, then.81 mins: Southampton get away a Baines free-kick and Redmond is on a solo mission. This time, he takes on the shot. It flies over. 80 mins: Substitution: On comes Klaassen to one hell of a cheer, and he arrives in place of Phil Jagielka. 79 mins: First, a Southampton corner, or a pair of them. James Ward-Prowse is taking his time over these. His second swung out of play.78 mins: Davy Klaassen, who cost £24m, and has not played a league game since September, is coming on. 77 mins: Schneiderlin booked for a hacking foul. 76 mins: Substitution: Off comes Austin for Shane Long, perhaps the best defensive striker in the business. They used to say that about Ade Akinbiyi, another player who had problems in front of goal. 74 mins: Redmond, showing the attacking flair that Pep Guardiola demands of him, burst through there and looked to have a sight on goal. He checked back. Saints looking wobbly all of a certain, uncertain, in fact. 72 mins: Everton on the attack. Schneiderlin on the flank centres the ball and it’s panic stations as Southampton eventually get the ball clear. There could be plenty of that to come in the remaining minutes of this game.71 mins: So, Southampton’s creative hub has departed the scene, and is replaced by a dead-ball specialist. Looks like Mark Hughes is trying to hang on here. 70 mins: Substitution for Saints: Tadic off for James Ward-Prowse. 69 mins: Jagielka has to take evasive action as another Southampton overload on the wing looked to have Bertrand in a scoring position,68 mins: So, the minutes tick down on West Brom’s brave attempt to escape. Ten points from a possible 12 and it won’t be enough.66 mins: Schneiderlin gets room to play a pass through, but he also plays it too hard. 65 mins: An actual Everton attack. Niasse controls the ball, carves out space and booms in a cross. Tosun is just too short to get there.64 mins: Redmond was nearly in for another, but just lost the flight of the ball as it came in. 62 mins: Boos as Leighton Baines overhits a pass. This could get nasty. 61 mins: On the sidelines, Allardyce is chewing gum like a cow attacking some finest cud. Oddly, he seems less secure in his job than the man stood alongside him, Hughes. Both are adopting alpha male stances of the type favoured by those in the Conservative Party. 60 mins: So in going two up front, Big Sam has made his second tactical change in a matter of minutes. He had to do something. That lap of appreciation will be outnumbered by the taxi queue at Lime Street if this continues for Everton.59 mins: What does it all mean? Southampton will climb to 16th and West Brom will go down if this stays the same.57 mins: Everton substitution: Niasse comes on for Vlasic. 57 mins: Well, well. The first quality of the game and Southampton lead.Tadic ball out to Cedric, some quality at last and Nathan Redmond nods in on the back post. Boos from the home fans, roars of hope from the away contingent. Saints alive!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7caedabf2c14e50f7cbd4dc8757adea3ef1e915c/0_803_6132_3679/master/6132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f271020a2de37319f1bc7e3b4b0ff3ab","title":"happiness curve life gets better after 50 jonathan rauch","story":"Jonathan Rauch, author of The Happiness Curve, was relieved to find an explanation for his gloom – academics say adulthood happiness is U-shapedWhen Jonathan Rauch fell into the doldrums in his 40s, he had no idea why. Life was good: he had a successful career, a solid relationship, good health and sound finances. Then he learnt about the happiness curve and it all became clear.Academics have found increasing evidence that happiness through adulthood is U-shaped – life satisfaction falls in our 20s and 30s, then hits a trough in our late 40s before increasing until our 80s. Forget the saying that life begins at 40 – it’s 50 we should be looking toward.Rauch, a senior fellow at the US thinktank the Brookings Institution, was so relieved to have found an explanation for the gloom that hit him and, he believed, many others in middle age that he became evangelical about spreading the word. He has written a book, The Happiness Curve: Why Life Gets Better After 50 (out in the US 1 May and UK 14 June), which includes personal stories, the latest data and illuminating interviews with economists, psychologists and neuroscientists.“The most surprising thing is that age tends to work in favour of happiness, other things being equal,” he tells the . “The most strange thing is that midlife slump is often about nothing.”Hold off on splashing out on that flashy sports car or embarking on an affair though. It is not the same as a midlife crisis, which according to the stereotype demands an urgent, rash response. The slump isn’t caused by anything, according to Rauch. It is a natural transition, simply due to the passing of time. “It’s a self-eating spiral of discontent,” he says. “It’s not because there’s something wrong with your life, or your marriage, or your mind, or your mental health.”Not everyone will experience a sunnier outlook in their 50s and beyond, Rauch acknowledges, because factors such as orce, unemployment or illness can counter this. But, other things being equal, the U-curve holds.Rauch, an author and journalist, adds: “Those most likely to notice the arrow of time are the people without a lot of other change or difficulty in their life. Things seem to be going well for them, they’re achieving their goals, and nothing much has changed. They think, ‘Why do I feel less satisfied than I expected to? Why is this going on year after year? Why does it seem to be getting worse and not better? There must be something wrong with my life.’“Well, there’s nothing wrong with your life, you’re just feeling the effects of time which others who may have more turbulent lives may not notice as much.” Rauch details a raft of research in his book to back up his claims. A 2008 study by economists David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald found the U-curve – with the nadir, on average, at age 46 – in 55 of 80 countries, and they cited more than 20 other papers finding the U. It tends to show up in wealthier countries where people live longer, healthier lives. Life satisfaction statistics for the UK in 2014-15 show happiness declining from youth through middle age, hitting a low at 50 and rising to a peak at 70.Not all economists and psychologists agree. Economists Paul Frijters and Tony Beatton factored in the possibility that those who become happier in the studies are the same people who are more content when they start out. This can help them achieve greater career or relationship success, which leads to more happiness. Correcting for this effect, the U-shape disappears.Rauch, however, believes he is a textbook example of the U-curve. His mother suffered from depression and his parents broke up when he was 12, leaving his father to bring up three children on his own. Two years later, his father, a stressed and overworked lawyer in his mid-40s, lost his biggest client.Rauch remembers himself at 20, keen to accomplish something worthwhile by middle age and believing that when he did, he’d appreciate it.By his 40s, he had surpassed his dreams. He had published books he was winning journalism prizes he was in a relationship with Michael, the man he would later marry he lived in an area of north Virginia with a strong sense of community. Yet he was preoccupied with what he had not achieved.He explains: “I was someone who was fortunate. I had good health and after my 20s, which were difficult because I came out as gay, I met one goal after another with more success than I’d ever expected. “All these feelings of discontent and restlessness – and even sometimes worthlessness and this feeling I’d almost wasted my life – kept coming back.“None of this made any rational sense. I began to think there must be something wrong with me. I began to think my personality had begun to turn dark in some way and that of course compounded the problem.”Around 50, the fog began to lift, despite the death of both his parents, the loss of his magazine job and the failure of a startup venture. Rauch, 58, says: “In my 50s, first the volume of the demons’ voices went down, and now I rarely hear their voices at all.” While researching his book, Rauch spoke to many people who’d experienced similar feelings.Karla, 54, is on the upswing of the curve. She says she is savouring her friendships more, feeling more organised and efficient, and doing more volunteering work. “Now I feel grateful for the now,” she tells Rauch. “On a day-to-day basis I probably do the same things, but I feel different.”Rauch tells the : “That’s a very profound insight because what we’re talking about here is not that the conditions of your life change in some huge way, but how you feel about your life changes.”Rauch puts forward various explanations for why we feel happier in our 50s and beyond.Research shows that older people feel less stress and regret, dwell less on negative information and are better able to regulate their emotions. Nor is status competition as important.Rauch says: “We seem to be wired to seek maximum status when we are young – the ambition to be on top of the world, to have the big job, to have the extraordinary marriage to the wonderful person or lots of money. Or some form of greatness, which is what I dreamed of in my 20s, to write some book that would outdo Shakespeare.”We are over-optimistic in youth about how much satisfaction we will get out of our future successes, he believes.“As we get into our 30s and 40s, we’ve achieved most of those things, but we’re not wired to sit back and enjoy our status. “The same ambition that made us status hungry makes us hungry for more status. We’re on the hedonic treadmill. We don’t feel the satisfaction we expected, so we think there’s something wrong with our lives.”As we get older, our values change. “You hear people say, ‘I don’t feel the need to check those boxes any more’, or ‘I don’t care that much what other people think’.”Older people feel relieved of a burden that makes it easier to savour other simpler pursuits such as spending time with grandchildren, a hobby or volunteer work. Rauch would like to see more help for people to relaunch themselves after this midlife transition, including greater opportunities for adult learning and companies creating more part-time positions or allowing gap years.“There’s a huge amount of untapped wisdom and potential to be unlocked. Because of the happiness curve, they’re often in a position where they want to give back. They want to be mentors, they want to be volunteers and they want to work at not so difficult jobs which allow them to use their skills.”Rauch has a few tips for relieving midlife malaise, such as talking to friends about it and understanding it’s normal. It is also helpful to stop comparing yourself to others, he says.But if all that makes no difference, give it time. As Rauch approaches 60, he feels ever more grateful for his life. He wishes he’d known this when he was in the trough of the curve because, as he says: “It’s worth the wait.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6211d329c8a86425bba59d26f44c4a644ad194f3/1063_677_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f80cb51ab8c7409bddd772e4f166542e","title":"meera sodha recipe green pea black eyed bean chickpea usal","story":"Bring some ersity to your Indian food repertoire with this spiced soup packed with pulsesIndia is a country of 1.3bn people who live across 29 states from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean.

She had spent the previous decade teaching in Cambridge but last July she and her husband moved north. And while Sheffield has provided a great job and an affordable home, one thing the notoriously friendly city has not provided is mates.“No one talks about the process of making friends at our age,” she says. Olivia has tried. She bonded with someone in her Zumba class, but weeks later the woman got a job in another city. Her job has not helped. “There aren’t a lot of people in my stage of life at work, and anyway, as a teacher you spend the whole day in a classroom full of teenagers.”And so Olivia is taking a proactive step – she is going speed mating.Billed as “Tinder for friends, but in real life” the initiative is the brainchild of Megan Griffith, co-founder of the arts collective Girl Gang. The Sheffield event is held at the Leadmill nightclub. About 40 people turn up, almost all of them women (men are welcome, says Griffith, but need to know they will be in the minority). They range in age from early 20s to mid 40s. On arrival everyone is given a sheet with spaces for names, email addresses and phone numbers. Olivia’s original goal for the evening was to get one person’s number. “But then I thought, maybe that’s unrealistic so I’ve lowered my expectations. I’ve just got to see it as having a fun evening, and even if it goes badly, at least it’ll make a good story in the staff room.”The “Speed-Mating” event begins with “person bingo”, then people pair up and ask quick-fire questions for five minutes. Next they pair up with someone else to ask “would you rather?” questions, and a third person for “snog, marry avoid”.Kerry Chase and Aimée White are paired up and quickly move on from talking about the suggested questions to chatting about White’s time living in Serbia. A newcomer to Sheffield, White bemoans how tricky it is to make friends as an adult.“It’s not like when you’re a kid,” she says. “You can’t just say: ‘Let’s go play’. It’s like: ‘I’m not being creepy, but I just want a friend.’ Yeah, that’s creepy.”For several hours people chat, debate current affairs in small groups, make outfits out of newspaper and participate in various “organised fun” activities, all the time sussing each other out as potential friend material.After the first event in Manchester in October 2016, Girl Gang has run a dozen speed mating nights across Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, and has had requests to start them up everywhere from York to Leamington Spa. However, they often sell more tickets than they have guests.Griffith says: “They’ve obviously booked a ticket thinking ‘I would really benefit from this event’, but then when it comes down to it, they can’t quite make themselves go.”Still, she thinks the event’s appeal comes from the fact that admitting to having no friends is taboo, so activities do not exist to help people build friendships.A 2013 analysis of 277 peer-reviewed studies on social relationships found that the size of people’s friendship networks increased until young adulthood and then decreased steadily from that point, suggesting that making friends becomes, if not more difficult, then at least less common.This could be for many reasons, such as family, jobs and time, according to Rachel Boyd of the mental health charity Mind. “Friendship groups can become more established, so it can feel even harder to meet new people if they already have their own groups of friends.”Moving home can represents a particular challenge. “Certainly it can be really difficult if you’re in unfamiliar territory to know how to meet people,” Boyd says.The Jo Cox commission on loneliness found that 9 million Britons always or often feel lonely, largely due to the weakening of traditional community spaces, such as churches, trade unions, pubs and workplaces.“In the last few decades, loneliness has escalated from personal misfortune into a social epidemic,” the Labour MP and commission chair, Rachel Reeves, said in a speech in December. “More and more of us live alone. We work at home more. We spend a greater part of our day alone than we did 10 years ago. It sometimes feels like our best friend is the smartphone.”However, technology, while often being blamed for social disconnection and isolation, may also form part of the solution. Bumble, the dating app known for not allowing men to contact women first, launched Bumble BFF in 2015, allowing people to find potential friends, after users said they wanted to use the origninal app for that purpose.But using an app or going to an event like speed mating to find friends is not without its stigma. Olivia is a pseudonym because she knows that if she used her real name and her students read this article “basically they would take the mick out of me”. When she told people she was going to a speed mating event, reactions were mixed. “I made a real effort to be vulnerable, so I told a few people I was doing this. Some people thought it was a bit weird, some people thought it was a great idea, others thought it was sad that I didn’t have friends, but then they offered to be friends with me,” she says, laughing.After the event, Olivia says she is exhausted: “I didn’t expect it to be so full-on.”“I felt like there were two groups – people who had gone with someone and were maybe approaching it as a fun chance to meet people, and people who I thought were in a similar position to me.“It’s also just reassuring to know I’m not the only person to feel like this. It’s not sad and it’s not pathetic, being 29 and not having friends in a new city.”Olivia has exceeded her goal for the evening, collecting three people’s numbers.The next day, she says she has been exchanging banter-filled texts and organised to go for a drink with one woman she met. A week later, she has had an offer to go to a comedy gig with a group, and a drink with someone else.“I’d say it’s absolutely been a success,” she says. “The other thing I’ve found is I’m more confident approaching people and suggesting meeting up. I think it’s given me a bit of a boost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1103607bd4af37f93ad73ad5a0b41a0b58babe/143_295_5318_3191/master/5318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=879cdc4f2d29bc9c29f05abc822ec700","title":"yotam ottolenghi asparagus recipes","story":"The quintessentially British early-summer treat is a breeze to prepareMost asparagus dishes are easy to prepare (this is no artichoke or broad bean) and quick to cook (longer cooking makes it go grey and lose its body).

Even asparagus by first-class post has lost its finer flavour.” Realistically, most of us don’t live by an asparagus field, so have to extend Grigson’s one-day rule. Even so, the principle is clear: for this delicate vegetable, the fresher the better.Please don’t be put off by the anchovies in this, even if you don’t like them. There are only two fillets, and they add a wonderfully deep, savoury flavour there’s nothing fishy about the end product, I promise.

Well, wonder no more, because last month they unleashed 44876, an “island-influenced” collaborative album that honours “the duo’s mutual love of Jamaica”. If you’re now thinking: “OK, but why?” then Sting has the answer. “The most important thing to me in any kind of music is surprise,” he told Rolling Stone. “And everybody is surprised by this collaboration – by what they’re hearing. We’re surprising.” Indeed. Another “surprising” recent collaboration was Q-Tip and Demi Lovato who have “reimagined” Elton John’s Don’t Go Breaking My Heart, while 2018 has also graced us with Charlie Puth trying to keep up with Boyz II Men, Justin Timberlake saying nothing with only-famous-in-America human beard Chris Stapleton and Sheryl Crow trying to keep her composure while the bloke from Britpop also-rans Reef shreds his larynx on My Sweet Love.With head-scratching musical pile-ups set to continue, we look at some of the best, AKA worst.It is weird to think that in 1998 it was rugged soap star-turned-rugged pop star Matthew Marsden who probably had to be convinced to work with Beyoncé. After signing a half-a-million-pound record deal with Columbia Records, having impressed them by a 12-month stint as a mechanic in Corrie, Marsden was paired with labelmates Destiny’s Child (first album lineup) for a perfunctory cover of Hall \u0026amp Oates’s She’s Gone. Beyoncé etc do the absolute minimum, barely masking the fact that their bits in the video were clearly shot in a record label office, likely on a separate continent to Marsden, with a record label employee holding the door shut.Eddie Murphy and Michael Jackson’s earnest Whatzupwitu (opening line of the video: “The elephant is dying”) tries to communicate man’s ills via the medium of cheap-sounding R\u0026ampB. One explanation for its existence is that Jackson only agreed to do it as part of a deal to get Murphy in his Remember the Time video a year earlier. Why else would noted perfectionist Jackson agree to be in a video that was apparently created using the very first iteration of MS Paint? “Always in the trees,” Jackson sings with underserved gusto while an illustrated heart is superimposed on to his forehead “Always in the seas,” he warbles while a shower of musical notes rains down. At the end, as a crudely drawn dove of peace flutters by, Murphy clamps his hand over Jackson’s mouth, probably to stop him shouting for help.Coldplay have always worried about staying relevant, even when their stage outfits suggested otherwise. As early as 2004, Chris Martin co-wrote and appeared on Jamelia’s See It In a Boy’s Eyes, following that with a collaboration with the then white-hot Nelly Furtado on 2006’s All Good Things (Come to an End). In 2012, he brought serial collaborator Rihanna into the fold on Princess of China, wise to the fact she can make anyone in her radius cooler by proxy, even Jonny Buckland. In 2017, aware that streaming rules the charts and faceless DJs are Radio 1 catnip, Coldplay sidled up to US dance bros Chainsmokers for the brainless Something Just Like This, which was a Top 3 hit in the UK and US. Fingers crossed this leads to a Calvin Harris v Starsailor remix of Alcoholic.Around the same time that Beyoncé was busy re-reading her contract and ignoring Matthew Marsden’s messages, future husband Jay-Z was in a similar bind. His Roc-A-Fella Records imprint had signed a deal in the UK with Northwestside, who, as it so happened, had a new boyband by the name of Another Level they, coincidentally, had some space on a remix for a big-name US rapper. The song was Be Alone No More, and while Jay’s verse wasn’t awful, he might have been rethinking his choices when he realised his remix only peaked at 11 in the UK, five places lower than the original, Jay-Z-less version.Obviously Kanye West isn’t exactly adverse to the unexpected collaboration – Fall Out Boy, Adam Levine, Estelle – but even during his most charitable moments there’s always been a sense of perspective. That went out of the window in 2010 when he collaborated with Oscar-winning egotist Jared Leto and his side-project Thirty Seconds to Mars on Hurricane. Over Leto’s strained vocals and a backing track that would make Muse wince, Kanye whips out his vocoder for some nonsensical burbling that really should have stayed locked on someone’s hard drive.By 1986, after her first two solo albums had flopped, Janet Jackson was talking a lot about control. Control of her personal life (she’d recently annulled her marriage to James DeBarge) control of her career (she’d fired her controlling manager, father Joseph) and control of who she was as an artist (she’d hired producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis). You have to hope that in among all that annulling, firing and hiring she sought the requisite level of revenge on whoever came up with pairing her with Cliff Richard on 1984’s Giorgio Moroder-produced Two to the Power of Love. While a naive young Janet goes for playful and coy, Cliff delivers his lines like a Tory MP reciting grime lyrics.Since capitalising on the EDM boom, 50-year-old French DJ and producer David Guetta has worked with almost everyone. Seriously. This man’s iPhone address book is basically a who’s who of every bandwagon-jumping artist signed to a major label. It’s not just your typical dance music-adjacent pop stars, either. Give me the name of an unexpected collaborator and chances are he’s twiddled knobs in their vicinity. Stereo MCs? Yep, they’re on 2004’s amazingly titled Guetta Blaster album. Lil Wayne? Oh yes, on a 2011 album track that unfortunately also included Chris Brown.

What planet are they on? These are bad results.“You’re talking here about the government, which is possibly the worst government in living memory. You’ve had Windrush, you’ve had Grenfell, you’ve had the Brexit negotiations going from bad to worse, you’ve had the National Health Service under more pressure than it’s been for a long, long time, serial incompetence day after day after day, yet the public do not seem in nearly sufficient numbers remotely interested in supporting the Labour party.”Campbell, who backs a referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, said Labour should not be seen as supporting Theresa May’s plans for leaving the EU.Referencing a Blair-era soundbite, Campbell said Labour should be “tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit”, fighting against the UK’s departure from the EU while addressing the concerns of those who voted to leave.He said that if Labour’s Brexit tests were to mean anything the party could not support May’s strategy. “If they do, then though the Tories will be seen as Brexit’s architect, Labour will be its bricklayer, and history is harsh when the house comes tumbling down,” he said.“My Labour tribalism is being pushed to the limit by the return of militant-style nastiness in local politics, by my revulsion that any antisemitism has been allowed to fester, by the feeling that some in the leadership and their supporters feel much greater animus against other Labour supporters than against Tories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f28de778168e3273ae15696d6faeb9e20498fac/0_218_4310_2586/master/4310.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8bb7e6d6e80c76420ab81bd716e3bb0","title":"thousands scottish independence supporters march through glasgow","story":"March was organised by All Under One Banner coalition, which aims to run regular events until ‘Scotland is free’Tens of thousands of independence supporters marched through the streets of Glasgow, aiming to bring Scotland’s largest city to a standstill.Marchers draped in Saltires waved flags and played bagpipes and drums as they walked from Kelvingrove to Glasgow Green on Saturday. The event is one of a series being held across Scotland by All Under One Banner. The pro-independence organisation aims to march at regular intervals “until Scotland is free”.“Glasgow city centre will be brought to a standstill as our independence march traverses through en route to George Square,” one member of the organisation said on a fundraising page before the event.The march achieved a high turnout. Police Scotland estimated that 35,000 people joined the procession, which ended with speeches and music on the green.A small number of pro-union campaigners met the procession to counter its message. Stuart McMillan, a MSP for the Scottish National party, wrote on Twitter that he had received abuse including “a azi salute and the middle finger” from pro-union campaigners. Amanda McGinley took part in the march with her daughter Ellie Casson, with both women sporting Saltire bows in their hair. “We’re just basically fighting for the cause. We’re serial marchers,” she said.Lesley Crawford said she had come to show support. “There is still a lot of people who are still campaigning for a vote for independence, and we’re not going away,” she said.He said that level of support for Scotland leaving the UK was “a good place to start from” and that backing for independence was edging up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f696f7b1d46a45b26fc0a4473c94bc2c385a1a75/0_565_4037_2423/master/4037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21824d57c2bad6fda679a61aad8a4d7f","title":"nasa launches insight spacecraft mars","story":"A robotic geologist armed with a hammer and quake monitor rocketed toward Mars on Saturday, aiming to land on the red planet and explore its mysterious insides.In a twist, Nasa launched the Mars InSight lander from California rather than Florida’s Cape Canaveral. It was the first interplanetary mission ever to depart from the west coast, drawing pre-dawn crowds to Vandenberg Air Force Base and rocket watchers down the California coast into Baja. The spacecraft will take more than six months to get to Mars and start its unprecedented geologic excavations, traveling 300 million miles to get there. InSight will dig deeper into Mars than ever before – nearly 16ft – to take the planet’s temperature. It will also attempt to make the first measurements of marsquakes, using a high-tech seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface. The Atlas V rocket also carried a pair of mini satellites, or CubeSats, meant to trail InSight all the way to Mars in a first-of-its-kind technology demonstration. The $1bn mission involves scientists from the US, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. “I can’t describe to you in words how very excited I am … to go off to Mars,” said project manager Tom Hoffman from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “It’s going to be awesome.”If all goes well, the three-legged InSight will descend by parachute and engine firings onto a flat equatorial region of Mars – believed to be free of big, potentially dangerous rocks – on 26 November. Once down, it will stay put, using a mechanical arm to place the science instruments on the surface. “This mission will probe the interior of another terrestrial planet, giving us an idea of the size of the core, the mantle, the crust and our ability then to compare that with the Earth,” said Nasa chief scientist Jim Green. “This is of fundamental importance to understand the origin of our solar system and how it became the way it is today.” InSight’s chief scientist, Bruce Banerdt of JPL, said Mars was ideal for learning how the rocky planets of our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Unlike our active Earth, Mars has not been transformed by plate tectonics and other processes, he noted. Over the course of two Earth years – or one Martian year – scientists expect InSight’s three main experiments to provide a true 3-D image of Mars. The lander is equipped with a seismometer for measuring marsquakes, a self-hammering probe for burrowing beneath the surface, and a radio system for tracking the spacecraft’s position and planet’s wobbly rotation, thereby revealing the size and composition of Mars’ core. “InSight, for seismologists, will really be a piece of history, a new page of history,” said the Paris Institute of Earth Physics’ Philippe Lognonne, lead scientist of the InSight seismometer. Problems with the French-supplied seismometer kept InSight from launching two years ago. California was always part of the plan. Nasa normally launches from Cape Canaveral, but decided to switch to California for InSight to take advantage of a shorter flight backlog. This was the first US interplanetary mission to launch from somewhere other than Cape Canaveral."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4799bf839a7253505869a639f9f2fb45a49197/0_239_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5905b96f5820040f394f8045b0bd10","title":"elia viviani second stage giro d italia rohan dennis","story":"• Briton 20th in Giro after uneventful stage follows Friday’s crash• ‘It’s a three-week race,’ he says as Rohan Dennis takes pink jerseyIt has not been Chris Froome’s week. Arriving in Israel for the start of the Giro d’Italia he would have anticipated an uncomfortable encounter with the world’s media and certain members of the peloton who believe he should not be in the race given his ongoing anti-doping case. But after crashing during a practice ride on the opening day, a frosty reception was not his primary concern. He finds himself not even the top Briton in the standings, falling behind Simon Yates, who is in seventh place and a genuine overall podium contender in many minds.Froome avoided losing any more ground on his main rivals in a fairly uneventful second stage from Haifa to Tel Aviv and insisted he is still in a strong position to claim a historic third successive Grand Tour victory. The beachfront in Israel’s second biggest city was lined with thousands of boisterous spectators, straining over the barriers with camera phones as the four times Tour de France winner stayed safe in the peloton in a sprint finish.He is in 20th position overall after losing 37 seconds to his principal rival, Tom Dumoulin, in the time trial on the opening day. It was an understandably below-par performance given the damage done when he crashed from his bike during a reconnaissance ride only hours earlier. Froome was left bruised and bleeding after skidding across the tarmac in Jerusalem but presented a fresher figure at the start of the 167km stage in Haifa.To panic only one day into a three-week race would be premature, Froome maintained. “Two guys really stood out yesterday, Tom Dumoulin and the BMC rider, Rohan Dennis,” he said. “Otherwise I’d say I’m there or thereabouts with the other general classification guys. It’s still a three-week race and it’s not won in the prologue.“I’m lucky I didn’t hurt myself any worse than I did and I’m happy I didn’t lose too much time. You always feel bad after a crash but it’s part of our sport. You have to get up and keep going.”Dennis became the new pink jersey wearer by winning the second intermediate sprint and with it three bonus seconds, with Dumoulin second overall. The stage was won by the Italian Elia Viviani of Quick-Step Floors, who emerged the strongest in a frantic finish, beating Jakub Mareczko.Yates maintained his overall seventh place after exceeding expectations in the time trial, one of a number of eye-catching performances by the Bury-born rider in recent months. He finished seventh in the Tour de France last year and second in the prestigious Paris-Nice in March, so his capabilities are known but all indications are that a first top-10 finish in a time trial could represent a breakthrough for the 25-year-old, even if he did seek to play down the significance. “I always think I’m a contender so nothing has changed,” Yates said, adding it was “normal” he had so far been eclipsed by Froome in terms of public recognition. “He’s won the Tour de France four times and I’ve won fuck all.”Yates served a four-month suspension in 2016 after testing positive for the banned substance terbutaline. Froome is still waiting to see if he will be handed a ban after failing a drugs test last September when a urine sample showed twice the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol.Froome’s presence at the Giro given his ongoing fight to rescue his reputation is one of a number of contentious issues creating a powerful undercurrent to this race. The most obvious is the decision to hold the start in Israel, given the complex political landscape and violence on the Gaza Strip, one of the most contested territories in the world. It is the first time the start of the Giro has been held outside Europe in its 101-year history.While great fanfare accompanied the start in Jerusalem, Amnesty International has issued several strongly worded statements condemning the event. “We’re not going to tell the organisers where they should and shouldn’t start the race,” Kate Allen, its UK director said. “But the Jerusalem launch inevitably means Israel’s dismal human rights record is going to be in the spotlight.“The authorities in Jerusalem may have thought that the glitz of Giro d’Italia might have a ‘sportswash’ effect, removing some of the stain of Israel’s human rights record. Instead, it’s likely to bring it back into focus yet again.”But the Canadian-Israeli billionaire Sylvan Adams, whose money played a major part in bringing the Grande Partenze to the country, accused Amnesty of politicising a sporting event.Adams, a 59-year-old who inherited his property company from his father, a Romanian-born Holocaust survivor, emigrated to Israel two years ago. He said he hoped the event would both encourage more of the population to cycle but also alter the image Israel abroad.“The media tend to portray Israel in a one-dimensional fashion, always talking about the conflict, and it’s not the Israel I experience on a daily basis where we all largely get along,” he said. “That’s a story which visitors to Israel grasp but remains a bit of a secret to the wider world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05522b89fba2dfa5d40bd3a68c5d9404d3514457/0_90_2980_1788/master/2980.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3e7ce9152768b23c7ed52978b225c78","title":"david haye v tony bellew heavyweight boxing live","story":"Here comes Tony Bellew, cutting a moodier figure with the hood up on his robe as Haye waits in the ring wearing headphones. They’re certainly going big on the theatrics.David Haye is striding out to this slice of disco magnificence, grinning from ear to ear...Michael Buffer’s in the ring, ‘Sweet Caroline’ is blaring out – it can only mean one thing... ring walks are imminent.Predictions? AJ says Haye is the more talented fighter, but “you can’t deny Bellew’s heart”. Personally, I think Haye is battling his own body as much as his tenacious opponent – but if he can hold himself together, revenge should be his.While you’re here, why not sign up for The Recap, our weekly round-up of our best sporting coverage?Campbell gets the job done against an outmatched opponent, and says he is now lining up a rematch with Yvan Mendy, the only other man to defeat him. Eddie Hearn, never knowingly absent from ringside for these PPV occasions, confirms they’re set to fight a title eliminator, with the winner facing Mikey Garcia.In fine MBM tradition, you’re lining up to have a dig at tonight’s gladiators. “I don’t really mind who wins between Haye and Bellew, but every time I see a clip of Haye doing something he’s got the worst music on,” says David Jerome. “For that reason alone, I hope Bellew wins.”Nathan Fisher comes armed with heavy sarcasm: “I’m just wondering if you can shed any light on the rumours that Bellew has a wife and kids? He’s a pretty coy interviewee and I’d like to know a little more about that aspect of his life.”John ‘The Gorilla’ Ryder has stopped Jamie Cox in the second round, and is now targeting a super-middleweight world title shot. 2012 gold medallist Luke Campbell, who lost his WBA lightweight title bout to the exceptional Jorge Linares last year, is now in action against Troy James.There was a surprise earlier on at the O2 Arena, as Belfast’s James Tennyson inflicted a first ever defeat on Martin Joseph Ward in their super-featherweight bout. Olympic silver medallist Joe Joyce defeated Lenroy Thomas by second-round KO in his fourth professional fight, and Emmanuel Rodríguez became IBF world bantamweight champion after beating Paul Butler on points.Haye has tweeted – or possibly his PR, seeing as his hands have been wrapped. He’s trying his best to look relaxed:Anthony Joshua is ringside as a Sky pundit, and thinks Bellew has a chance of a repeat win tonight. On Bellew’s pre-fight aggro, he says “I do believe mind games are a big part of the build-up. They are listening – you’ve got to keep poking away.”Very few sequels live up to the original. For every Empire Strikes Back, there are several hundred Speed 2: Cruise Controls. Tonight’s sophomore meeting between David Haye and Tony Bellew has the potential to join that select club.After a long, drawn-out build-up packed with bluster and bile, Haye v Bellew I proved to be an absurd if absorbing experience. A promising contest fell apart when Haye snapped his Achilles in the sixth round. Barely able to throw a punch, Haye was at the mercy of his underpowered opponent, who laboured to a late knockout win. It was a case of the stoppable force against the unmoving object.Haye’s career seemed finished on that miserable night but he returns 14 months later cutting a very different figure. There is less swagger in his step this time, only a quiet confidence that a new coach has revived his pugilistic power. It’s been left to the abrasive, outspoken Bellew to supply the necessary pre-fight needle, with Haye swerving the verbal blows.Whether the former world heavyweight champion is waiting patiently until his fists can do the talking, or is still bruised from that first encounter, only time will tell. Bellew has also stayed away from the ring until this rematch, and will be motivated by Haye being made an odds-on favourite. Here’s hoping for all the thrills of the first fight, with none of the farce.Niall will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s Kevin Mitchell’s big fight preview:The conversation with Tony Bellew was idling towards an emotional conclusion as he reflected on what mattered to him in life: family, home, friends, Everton Football Club. And then the fighter detailed in a chilling blast of invective what he was going to do to David Haye at the O2 Arena in London on Saturday night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd09ace9622e9c89f95c322158ef6575bfff14a/0_207_5356_3214/master/5356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2639957e8a99a1073b4e170dd3ef208","title":"kentucky derby 2018 mendelssohn live","story":"Yoshida has just won the Turf Classic for Bill Mott and Jose Ortiz, and the rain is still coming down. The runners are out on the track for the Turf Classic, the last race before the Kentucky Derby itself, although there are all sorts of traditions to run through before the big race itself at 23.46 British time (18.46 here).I met an extremely pleasant chap called Crow Hollister while having breakfast in a local cafe this morning. He’s a Louisville native and made it plain how much this race means to the city and the state. The whole place stops at post time, everyone is in front of a screen if they’re not at the track and as he put it, it would be great to be hovering above Louisville to hear the roar that goes up from every corner of this city of 1.2m when the gates crash open and the field sets off. He also admits that he still gets misty-eyed when the crowd sings “My Old Kentucky Home” with the horses heading for the gates. That will, as always, be quite a moment, and it is now scarcely an hour away. Oh, and they were also stopping people bringing in umbrellas at the gate before racing. There is a huge umbrella graveyard somewhere nearby. Odd thing about all the rain is that it wasn’t forecast at all, even yesterday afternoon there was some confidence that there might be the odd shower but nothing too serious. The previous record for the wettest Derby day ever, incidentally, was apparently in 1918, so here’s an early warning to racegoers in 2118 to be sure to pack a raincoat. This is now, officially, the wettest Kentucky Derby ever, with 2.31 inches of inch so far today.Another runner in the big one that deserves a mention is My Boy Jack (stall 10, 5-1), as his current odds are well below the “morning line” prediction of 30-1. That may just mean that the early punters all know someone called Jack, as the serious money has yet to hit the pools, but he was tipped up by a few decent judges as likely to finish strongly through tiring horses from off the pace. as he did here in the Stonestreet at Lexington. Vino Rosso (stall 18, 14-1) is an interesting runner in the big one, as John Velazquez had a few options and came down in favour of the Wood Memorial winner. And three lengths behind Vino Rosso here is Enticed (stall 12, 55-1), who runs for Godolphin’s US operation overseen by Kiaran McLoughlin. Good Magic’s latest run was an improvement on his start behind Promises Fulfilled (stall three, 46-1) in the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream on 3 March. Good Magic (stall 6, 9-1) took last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, with Bolt D’Oro, who set off as the hot favourite, back in third. The track here at Churchill Downs is now officially “sloppy”, and the big outsider Funny Duck just took the Pat Day Mile on the dirt with Seahenge \u0026amp Ryan Moore out of the frame. Some more form from YouTube. Audible, currently a 6-1 chance to win from stall five, beat Hofberg, (25-1, stall nine) in the Florida Derby on 31 March. It was only the third start of Hofberg’s career and personally I have a feeling he might get a fair bit closer to Audible today. Don’t cry for me, David Johnson. I’m loving every minute.On the subject of HST’s day out at the Derby with Ralph Steadman, here’s a piece in the Courier Journal this week where they caught up with the artist to talk about his somewhat hazy memories of the 1970 Kentucky Derby. Went for a walk on the infield earlier (thankfully before the worst of the rain) to see if it bears any resemblance to the scene depicted in Hunter S Thompson’s famous piece “The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved”. There were plenty of moderately offensive bespoke suits in outlandish colours and designs but nothing too debauched, though it was early and I can’t imagine what it must be like out there now after several inches of rain. A proper gonzo journalist would head out there and wade in. I’m happier being non-gonzo and (relatively) dry.On with the form guide. Todd Pletcher’s Magnum Moon, who will break from stall 16, is, like Justify, trying to brake the so-called Curse of Apollo. He was the last horse to win without running as a juvenile, back in 1882. Whatever you think of stats, that’s quite a stat. Here he is winning the Arkansas Derby, with Solomini, who is drawn in 17 today, back in third. Deauville, one of Ryan Moore’s three rides on the undercard before the Kentucky Derby, has been scratched from the Turf Classic.Just went for a quick spin around the paddock. There are racegoers taking bets on whether they can jump puddles without getting their feet wet, and there are enough around to construct a entire Grand National course of puddles should you so wish. There’s a monster near the parade ring that would be a very daunting Chair. Justify, meanwhile, put up two of the best Beyer figures of the year in his first two starts this year, which were also the first two runs of his career, and then established himself as the likely favourite today with an easy win in the Santa Anita Derby on 7 April, where Bolt D’Oro, who is also in today’s field, was three lengths away in second. US fans are a little unsure what to make of Mendelssohn’s romp in the desert, not least after Rayya, the runner-up, completely failed to fire in the Kentucky Oaks here on Friday. But the time guru Andy Beyer put a figure of 106 on it, which is just 1lb behind Justify, the favourite, and Mendelssohn also has winning form in the States in last year’s Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf, where the beaten horses included Masar, who was third in today’s 2,000 Guineas. Three hours to the off for the 144th Kentucky Derby and here’s the first of the video form for tonight’s big race. Mendelssohn’s romp in the UAE Derby seemed extraordinary at the time and still looks fairly remarkable when you look at it again a few weeks later.Threeandfourpence, Ryan Moore’s first ride for Aidan O’Brien here today, was never a factor and out of the frame behind Maraud (Todd PletcherJohn Velasquez). Hello from a decidedly damp Churchill Downs racecourse in Louisville, Kentucky, where steady – and at times torrential – rain has been an unwelcome addition to what is, without any doubt, one of the great occasions in any sport. It is not just a horse race, it is a national and international event which permeates the consciousness of pretty much everyone, in terms of an awareness that it exists at any rate. The Kentucky Derby stars in films, books and popular culture. Like the Grand National, people just know about it.For European racing fans, this year’s race is mostly about Mendelssohn, the 18-and-three-quarter length winner of the UAE Derby last time out and the most credible transatlantic contender for the Run For The Roses for at least 26 years. For the Americans, though, this is the final stop at the end of a traditional four-month trail that leads through trial events in Florida, Arkansas, New York, California and Kentucky towards what they like to call, with some justification, “the most exciting two minutes in sports”. And this year’s renewal is, by fairly general consent, one of the best for years, with no significant absentees among the main trial winners and Justify, who may shade Mendelssohn for favouritism, touted as a potential superstar by Bob Baffert, his trainer. Baffert, of course, prepared American Pharoah to win the first Triple Crown for 37 years in the 2015 season, and has been unstinting in his admiration for Justify, who is, like Mendelssohn, a son of the late stallion Scat Daddy. Scat Daddy’s final crop of yearlings went through the ring last year and fetched some astonishing prices as buyers fought to take their last chance to buy a piece of his genes. As was the case when Galileo eventually taking over the mantle of Europe’s top stallion from his own sire, Sadler’s Wells, a Derby-winning son of Scat Daddy would command a huge fee at stud and for all the tradition, history and glory attached to a win today, there is potentially a staggering amount of money at stake as well. As mentioned earlier, the weather here at Churchill is nothing like the warm temperatures and clear skies that were forecast just a couple of days ago (by my weather app, at any rate). There was a slight but steady drizzle in the early part of the morning, and then a proper downpour which started about three hours ago (17.30 BST), and while it has eased off somewhat since, the dirt track – which was officially “fast” this morning – is now described as “muddy” and has been sealed (which basically means compacted to keep it as even as possible. The racing here has been underway for nearly six hours – there are 14 races in all, with the 144th Kentucky Derby at number 12 – and Ryan Moore is due out imminently to ride Threeandfourpence for Aidan O’Brien in the Grade Two American Turf. He also rides Seahenge – like Mendelssohn, a son of Scat Daddy – over a mile on dirt at 4.28 local time (21.28 BST), and Deauville in the $1m Old Forester Turf Classic (10.25 BST) before climbing aboard Mendelssohn when the traditional “Riders Up” call goes out about 15 minutes before the off for the big one.The on-track betting for the big race is relatively unaffected by the changing conditions, with Mendelssohn currently showing as a 6-1 chance behind the 7-2 favourite, Justify. Mendelssohn’s odds with British books range from 3-1 to 5-1 and they are probably looking at quite a few tasty doubles after his stable companion Saxon Warrior took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket earlier today. I’ll be posting plenty of YouTube video form for the big-race contenders shortly if you are hoping to make up your mind which way to jump. An enthralling few hours lie ahead with a potential moment of horse racing history in the offing and I’m very much looking forward to sharing it with you.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cead1bf9f76ff93c117bba504eaec77d348bedf/51_0_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c827c7a24c2b8302d0dc894c514e23f","title":"elisabeth moss handmaids tale this is happening in real life wake up people","story":"As the Golden Globe-winning drama returns, the creators and cast of the show discuss the new horrors on the horizon, and how it’s become a symbol of new resistance“We knew that we were doing something important,” says Samira Wiley, reflecting on the feelings of the cast and creators of The Handmaid’s Tale in the months running up to the show’s launch last spring. “We knew that we were making something with a lot of integrity. But we definitely didn’t mean for it to be that timely and that relevant.” Nine months later, the television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s seminal dystopian novel was not only sweeping the boards at every awards ceremony – remarkable for a new show, with such dark, brutal themes – but had rapidly become a social phenomenon, too: a symbol of the new resistance, with the handmaids’ uniform co-opted by protesters at US courthouses, on marches, and in Hollywood itself.“When we were arriving at the Golden Globes, there were a bunch of handmaids outside,” recalls Wiley, who plays Moira, rebellious best friend of the main protagonist Offred. The group, calling themselves the Hollywood Handmaids, were holding a silent protest to demand an end to sexual assaults and inequalities in the industry.“It has been absolutely crazy,” says Wiley, shaking her head in disbelief.Certainly, the fervour surrounding the series is unprecedented, which is all the more exceptional considering that Atwood wrote the story in 1984. There have been previous adaptations, too: a 1990 film written by Harold Pinter and starring Natasha Richardson, plus an opera and a ballet. But none have sparked the torrent of memes, slogan T-shirts bearing lines from the book, and even, apparently, tattoos of its quotable mantras.On a sub-zero day in Toronto, Canada, I visit the set of the show to meet the cast and creators. Such is the secrecy surrounding the production that all correspondence with the team regarding my visit refers to the show as “Rocket Woman”, a security measure designed to avert overexcited fans, but also any fundamentalist groups who might object to its themes, I am told. As season one ended exactly as the novel did – with a pregnant Offred bundled into a van – this second series will not be Atwood’s story, moving beyond the content of the classic text. She is a consultant on the show, and approves the scripts. However, “that doesn’t mean I have veto power”, the author recently told Newsweek. “No one would ever give an author that you’d be really foolish to do so.” That simultaneously bestows both freedom and pressure on the show’s writers, on top of already enormous expectations.“The way we made the first season, which was in great ignorance, is exactly the way we’re trying to make the second season,” says showrunner Bruce Miller, as he shows me around the sprawling set. “We try not to think about people out there dissecting it, but instead just think about making something that’s cool.’Elisabeth Moss, a producer on the show as well as its star, also points out that the first season was not a simple facsimile of the book, either: timelines were altered, some details were changed, while partial sentences were extrapolated from the text to create entire scenes and stories. “We were faithful to the idea and the tone and the messages of the book,” she says, “but we kept characters alive that died and we did things that were never in the book, so we’re not afraid of that.”Miller admits that, while the writers did not seek to weave threads from current news events – such as the #MeToo movement – into the story, it is impossible not to be influenced by the political and social context in which The Handmaid’s Tale is made and consumed. “I try to let the audience figure out the relationship between the show and the real world, and how it’s interpreted and where it’s put in a political context,” he says. “But one of the things the writing staff brought this year was that – because of the more polarised discussions happening all over the world, but especially in the US, including the #MeToo movement – you’re starting to hear people verbalise things you didn’t think people thought any more.”This season will also see an expansion of the world that Atwood created: the Colonies, the toxic waste dumps to which “Unwomen” are exiled and Little America, in Canada, where refugees from Gilead are living. “There’s also a scene that addresses journalism in Gilead,” says Moss. “It’s really intense. But it needs to be addressed. Because, what would have happened to journalists?” she asks, rhetorically.For Fiennes, whose character has sex with Offred every month, against her will, in a bid to get her pregnant, the burden of playing a rapist – albeit one committing an act sanctioned by the ruling order – does not sit easily. “I am repulsed by it,” he says, simply. “I am very affected by some of the things we have to do, this season in particular, I have found some of it very difficult.”In seeking to build an authentic world beyond that outlined in the book, Miller and his team drew – as Atwood did in her original story – on history, creating a meticulously detailed mythology for Gilead. This explains why the outwardly pious Commanders of the Faith have based themselves in Cambridge, Massachusetts, north of Boston, rather than Washington DC. “It’s not the traditional seat of power, but in America it’s the seat of intellectual power, and Boston has such a huge place in our Puritan history,” Miller explains. He says he has an unusual advantage in being able to question Atwood directly about her own inspirations. “Usually when you adapt a classic, the author is long gone,” says Miller. “But not only is Margaret very much around, she also has a spectacular memory about what she was thinking when she wrote The Handmaid’s Tale.”One criticism levelled at the first season was the show’s depiction of race. While Miller deliberately created a multiracial world (unlike in the original book, in which minorities had been exiled), the show did not deal with, or mention, racism. Among other critical voices, New York magazine described this as the show’s “greatest failing”. How those criticisms have been taken on board in the storylines for season two remains to be seen, but some cast members say that such issues are influencing their performances.“I watched a lot of movies on slavery, just to see how characters moved,” says Amanda Brugel, the mixed-race actor who plays Rita, one of Gilead’s low-ranking domestic servants, whose story will be more prominent this season. “I especially watched the women who were slaves, versus a character in our show like Serena Joy, who’s lived a life of freedom. I very much lean on past experiences in which I felt like I have actually been a different class, and a slave, in situations just because of my colour,” she says.Moss and I speak again, a few weeks after my visit to the set, on the day of the March for Our Lives, held across US cities and organised by the surviving students of the Parkland school shootings. Donald Trump has suggested, as a solution to the growing tide of similar tragedies, arming teachers in schools. “When I heard that, I got chills,” says Moss. “Because I’m on set with a man pretending to hold a machine gun, in a situation that he just shouldn’t have one in.”The parallels between the current rapid militarisation of the US and Gilead are undeniable.“In the book, Margaret calls it the new normal,” Moss continues. “It’s a line that Aunt Lydia says – this will all be normal to you one day. That’s scary to me.” She has no tolerance, however, for people who find the show itself frightening. “I hate hearing that someone couldn’t watch it because it was too scary,” she says. “Not because I care about whether or not they watch my TV show I don’t give a shit. But I’m like, ‘Really? You don’t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.’”The Handmaid’s Tale returns to Channel 4 in May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d77e3b19842a5b4b3b0fdbd6baaed8ae579433ba/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f2e849b9e69a26055e960571fd4c732","title":"hawaii evacuations ordered as kilauea volcano erupts","story":"Lava spurts through cracks in roads and flows in residential areas on Big Island before earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.4 and 6.9 reportedA whole town has been ordered to evacuate after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island caused lava to flow in residential areas, followed by two large earthquakes.All 1,500 inhabitants of Pahoa were told to leave after steam and lava poured out of a crack in the nearby Leilani Estates. Lava spurted into the sky from the road and aerial drone footage showed a line of lava snaking through a forest. On Friday afternoon, a 5.4-magnitude earthquake hit the island followed by a 6.9-magnitude earthquake about an hour later, officials reported.A resident, Ikaika Marzo, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread over an area about 180 metres wide behind one house in Leilani Estates on Thursday. He said it sounded like a jet engine.Residents had been warned for the last week that they should prepare to evacuate, with officials saying an eruption would give little warning. Nearby community centres were providing shelter.Earlier in the week, a school in the Puna district was closed due to the continuing seismic activity and several roads cracked under the strain.Since Monday, hundreds of earthquakes – most of them about 2.0 magnitude – have been recorded in the area. The Puu Oo, which is a volcanic cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kīlauea volcano, began to collapse on Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into newly created underground chambers.Officials said it was impossible to predict how long the eruption would last. The volcano had burned two homes, authorities said. Jeremiah Osuna, who captured drone footage of the lava stream, told the Honolulu television station KOHN that it sounded as if someone “put a bunch of rocks into a dryer”. He said he could smell the sulphur, along with the burning trees and other vegetation.The US Geological Survey said fresh cracks in the ground were reported on Thursday afternoon and hot vapour and lava began to erupt.The geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed below Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night. The Hawaii county civil defence agency closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.After the second major earthquake, there were no immediate reports of significant damage, and the Hilo airport and highways did not face major impacts, according to the Associated Press. There were also no reports of damage. The earthquake wasn’t strong enough to cause a tsunami, and no tsunami threat or advisory has been put in place, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.Kilauea is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It is located in the Hawaii Volcanoes national park, which has closed off nearly 6,350 hectares (15,700 acres) due to “the possibility of a new eruption and unstable geologic activity”.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been non-explosive, but an eruption in 1924 spewed ash and nine tonnes of rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 460 metres (1,500ft) high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried large areas of land and destroyed many homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/998185944414b2304b5c4ba2b266c40c6509930c/0_16_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=733f297362ab320127d1c96025d97f81","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

The message, not the messenger, was of primary importance the posters were “weapons of the struggle”, not for decoration or display in “bourgeois places of culture” and certainly not for sale – ever. Fifty years on, as France marks the anniversary of May 1968 with a new wave of strikes and student protests, the leftwing idealism of the Atelier Populaire has been trumped by the commerical instincts of the free market. Today the posters are on display in museums and for sale at auctions and galleries across the world with prices topping £2,000.Currently there are exhibitions at the Musée de Beaux-Arts in Paris, and on sale at the Royal Academy’s London Original Print Fair, the Tate Modern and at Lazinc gallery in Mayfair. The dealer, Gerrish Fine Art, has amassed more than 150 rare and original Atelier Populaire posters, some of which are on sale at the RA fair for between £350 and and £2,250 each.“These icons of rebellion and civil disorder are the forerunners of today’s thriving street art movement. As monuments to the intense power of the image to bring about change, they represent one of the most potent and striking graphic revolutions in history – fierce symbols of art at the service of insurrection,” it writes.Art experts now predict a boom in demand for the work that is credited as an inspiration for punk art in the 1970s and Banksy today.Not everyone is delighted by this belated critical recognition. The French political scientist, Thomas Guénolé, a member of the hard-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party is shocked, but not surprised.“We have a civilisation that cannot accept that there are some things that have no price,” Guénolé told the Observer.“The Atelier Populaire was vehemently opposed to the posters being sold, clearly declaring it was unacceptable to make money from them. But we are in a society where everything is for sale: workers, culture, museums, public services, our private lives … it’s hardly a surprise that great symbols like this become nothing more than goods to be sold. We see the same with Che Guevara’s image.”In the spring of 1968, as student protests spread to the Sorbonne and strikes paralysed France, Atelier Populaire produced around 500 different posters reflecting opposition to President Charles de Gaulle, the government, the police, media and capitalism. Printed on newspaper rolls supplied by striking printers, the images were simple but powerful. As the weeks went on they developed a collective style.Gérard Fromanger, an Atelier artist, said in 1988: “We were having great fun, we lived in the school day and night, it was passionate … and we were the only ones working, which was gratifying. The whole country was on strike except us. We never worked so hard in our lives. We were printing day and night.”The École was cleared by police in the early hours of 28 June, 1968. They found a few pots of paint and a handful of posters, but not the secret printing press they were seeking.Georgie Gerrish, of Gerrish Fine Art, who has spent 12 years collecting Atelier Populaire posters, says their message is still relevant. “Everyone is realising how historically important they are. They are from a magic moment full of hope and the idea that if we pulled together we could bring about monumental change. I suppose it does seem strange selling them, but we are now 50 years on, and perhaps the motives for not selling them are not so strong.”Guénolé, a strong supporter of the ongoing wave of public sector strikes in France, said their sale is “sacrilege”.He added: “If you consider the values they represent, then selling one of these posters for £2,000 is a misuse of something sacred. And their messages are relevant today, so much so I am using them to make a point about today’s protests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c88b335b99b25984992aa6ffe78cf1a118d1106/0_285_4829_2898/master/4829.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3e180941a43b4efe00bf816fc7fbf9","title":"israel pulls out of race for seat on un security council","story":"Three-way contest averted, meaning Germany and Belgium will likely take thetwo available positions on UN’s most powerful bodyFacing an uphill struggle in an election next month, Israel has announced it is pulling out of a race for a seat on the UN security council.Israel was in a three-way contest with Germany and Belgium for two seats representing the western-democratic group of nations on the UN’s most powerful body starting in January.The security council has five permanent members – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – and 10 members elected by the 193-member general assembly for two-year terms.Israel’s UN mission said in a statement that “after consulting with our partners, including our good friends, the state of Israel has decided to postpone its candidacy for a seat on the security council”.“It was decided that we will continue to act with our allies to allow for Israel to realise its right for full participation and inclusion in decision-making processes at the UN,” the statement said. “This includes the security council as well as an emphasis on areas related to development and innovation.”Israel’s withdrawal virtually guarantees Germany and Belgium victory in the 8 June election and seats on the council.Candidates for non-permanent seats on the council are chosen by regional groups and for 55 years Israel was not part of a regional group, which barred it from many UN positions.The late US ambassador Richard Holbrooke succeeded in 2000 in getting the western European and others regional group known as WEOG to invite Israel to be a temporary member, which later was extended indefinitely.Israel announced its withdrawal minutes before WEOG candidates were scheduled to appear and answer questions from UN member states.Germany’s UN ambassador, Christoph Heusgen, said in response to a question about Israel’s withdrawal: “We have never run against a country. There is nothing where we really oppose each other. We went for our own programme. We asked support, and we want also to seek high support from you.”He noted there had been a lot of discussion at the UN on how regional groups should put forward candidate countries. “I’m in favour of having more candidates,” Heusgen said, even though “this is tougher” because candidates then have to say what they stand for and respond to sometimes tough questions about their country. “So therefore ... I regret that Israel withdrew from the race,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475796.1524775142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"skylarks stunned me just like the poets the bird has hoisted into verse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe lark ascending: the skylark has hoisted countless poets into verse. Illustration: Michael VineyMy first encounter with a singing skylark, a few decades ago, put me flat on my back on the moss of the dunes – a proper posture for awe.The bird had sprung, as larks do, almost from under my feet and spiralled up to hang as a speck in the clear air, pouring out a ceaseless flow of whistlings and trillings that seemed to stun the whole hillside into listening. They certainly stunned me, just like the countless poets the skylark has hoisted into verse.One could look to science (flight up to 100m, wings fluttering at 10 to 12 beats a second, sonagram with up-and-down pitch pattern between 2kHz and 5.5kHz over about six seconds, average song up to two or three minutes but can go on for six). Or could simply settle for Shelley: “Higher still and higher  From the earth thou springest . . . And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.”A lot more is assembled online by a sensitive American blogger, who didn’t, one gathers, vote for Trump. There are further from Cecil Day-Lewis (“Be strong your fervent soaring, your skyward air!  Tremble there, a nerve of song!”) and a typically ecstatic tongue-twister from Gerard Manley Hopkins (“Left hand, off land, I hear the lark ascend,  His rash-fresh re-winded new skeinèd score  In crisps of curl off wild winch whirl, and pour  And pelt music, till none’s to spill or spend”).Ted Hughes, whose skylark may have soared in Connemara, is predictably darker: “The lark begins to go up  Like a warning  As if the globe were uneasy . . .  You stop to rest, far up, you teeter  Over the drop . . .  Then up and up and up  Like a mouse with drowning fur  Bobbing and bobbing at the well-wall”.The globe is indeed uneasy, as one in eight of its bird species is threatened with extinction. As farming intensifies, Europe’s skylarks are down by almost half, and in Ireland by 30 per cent, since 1970.It is no longer breeding in many parts of the south and east, its nesting retreating to the uplands and coastal margins and islands. On the grassy machair behind the dunes, below me, Michael Longley has pictured the spring tide “seeping after sun and moon  To pour cupfuls into the larks’ nests”.An English skylark researcher, Eric Simms, a sound recordist as well as ornithologist, began all this more than half a century ago. He organised the synchronised recording, in early June 1951, of the spread of the dawn chorus across the UK.Skylarks anticipated the rise in light as it rolled across these islands from northeast to southwest. Their first song was recorded at 01.30 GMT in Scotland’s Cairngorms, 01.51 in Northumberland, 02.20 in Kent, 02.27 in Staffordshire, 02.28 in Co Antrim, 02.33 in Lancashire (a bit late in industrial haze) and 02.36 in south Wales.At RTÉ Derek Mooney and his Mooney Goes Wild team of experts pioneered the broadcasting of the Irish dawn chorus some two decades ago, then extended live transmission across Europe through links with other presenters as far as Russia.In 2016 this triumphant capture of the exquisite avian sound, with human commentary in a murmur of national accents, won the programme the Rose d’Or award for the European radio event of the year. Tomorrow’s dawn chorus will track the songs of myriad species, from the tropics to the tundra, in their first welcome to the day.For some of Ireland’s skylarks, meanwhile, there is promise of a better future. In the Bride Valley of east Cork – where, I’m told, the bird is “just hanging on in pockets here and there” – a five-year pilot project has been launched to reward tillage and dairy farmers for actions encouraging wildlife.In the logo of the new Bride Project (“Farming with Nature”) a skylark is poised above bands of green and gold, denoting the grass and cornfields that comprise its ideal habitat. Farm management plans will offer the birds patches of ungrazed pasture to nest in, and unsprayed stubble fields for winter feed.A Scottish skylark researcher, Diane Hendry, wrote an anxious poem about her job: “I worry that skylarks have been expelled,  become dissident birds.  I try to pretend they are simply out  of fashion, like Shelley  but secretly I am afraid  they have been hushed up”.In Bride Valley, let’s hope, they’ll soon be back in full number, and “soaring ever singest”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Michael McCarrick, an ESB employee who lived at Belleek, lost his life on FridayPro-choice group launches new campaign as referendum approachesDaughter of Ann Lovett\u0026rsquos boyfriend says \u0026lsquosilence an enormous burden for so many\u0026rsquoAssociation of Catholic Priests says unmarried, childless men should not be \u0026lsquodogmatic\u0026rsquoIncreasing pessimism in Dublin over prospects for Brexit talksDublin Fire Brigade made discovery after responding to house fire in MarinoPolice in Northern Ireland are appealing for witnesses to Ballyrashane Road crashTeenager questioned after 38-year-old left with \u0026lsquoextremely grave\u0026rsquo head injurySimon Harris said he would review consent for HSE director general if conflict of interestStrength of support for repeal noticeable across all age groups but apathy is the enemyMultimillion euro agreement follows \u0026lsquohorrific week\u0026rsquo for women in IrelandBusinesses on O\u0026rsquoConnell Street using high-pitched \u0026lsquomosquito alarms\u0026rsquo to combat loiteringFamily who lost two daughters at the hospital brought the case due to delay in reportUS campaigners in favour of retaining Eighth Amendment have faced \u0026lsquohateful\u0026rsquo commentsBody of 29-year-old was discovered at a house in Balbriggan at 8.30pm on FridayPolitical support drains away from HSE director general Tony O\u0026rsquoBrienMan (33) arrested for attack on member of Armed Regional Support Unit in GalwayBusinesses and householders find persistent difficulties with cover in spite of major worksEvents include Ed Sheeran gigs in Cork and Temple Bar celebration of Baltic Day"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484823.1525468285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gps to provide repeat smear tests free of charge","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe controversy arose after Limerick mother of two Vicky Phelan (43) settled a High Court action against a US laboratory. File photograph: Getty ImagesThe Government has agreed a multimillion euro deal with GPs to facilitate a free repeat smear test and a medical consultation after more than a week of public anxiety in the wake of controversy over cervical cancer screening.The Minister for Health Simon Harris said on Friday the last few days had represented a “horrific week” for the health service and for women the length and breath of the country. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar echoed this, saying it had been “a dreadful week” for the health service and a “culture change” was needed to reform it.He said “women are worried about CervicalCheck, were worried about their smear test history and worried about getting quite frankly simple answers to very important questions”.The Government on Friday evening reached agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) which will see GPs paid €50 for a consultation with women and €49 to carry out a repeat smear test.The number of women who may avail of such services is unknown but the cost overall is likely to run into tens of millions of euro with estimates ranging from €20 million to €75 million.The deal says that “given the current circumstance it is recognised that during this period of uncertainty and heightened concern women have been advised that they can seek appropriate support and advice from their GP, through consultation and arrangements for the provision of smear tests, where their concerns require such a response”.Dr Padraig McGarry of the IMO said: “This is a very painful, worrying and difficult time for many women throughout the country. While there is an ongoing capacity issue in general practice GPs will do their best to facilitate women in this process over the coming months”.The Minister also indicated he wanted to reassure women who were concerned about smear tests being sent abroad for analysis by asking the HSE to publish urgently the differential rate between a lab in the US and a lab in Ireland.Mr Varadkar also said he was “absolutely open” to a public inquiry into the cervical screening controversy. He said a scoping inquiry would be carried out prior to a statutory inquiry to get immediate answers. He said 180 of 208 women diagnosed with cervical cancer who should have received an earlier intervention have now been contacted.The controversy arose after Limerick mother of two Vicky Phelan (43) settled a High Court action against a US laboratory, subcontracted by the CervicalCheck screening programme to assess her smear tests, without admission of liability for €2.5 million last week.Ms Phelan discovered that a 2011 smear test that had initially shown no abnormalities was, three years later, found to be inaccurate. She was not told of the false test until September 2017. She is now suffering from terminal cancer.Mr Varadkar said he had been in touch with Ms Phelan on Friday morning and that she will be part of the scoping inquiry.“I am happy that I am going to be involved,” Ms Phelan said. “At least there will be somebody on this committee that will be sitting there representing the people.”Meanwhile, Sinn Féin is seeking to put down a motion of no confidence in HSE director general Tony O’Brien in the Dáil next week. Fianna Fáil has also called for him to step down."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485811.1525537135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i struggled with knowing who ann s baby s father might be","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnn Lovett: died after giving birth at the age of 15, in 1984. Photograph © The The daughter of Ann Lovett’s boyfriend has said the silence surrounding her death has been “an enormous burden on so many people”.Vicky Langan, the daughter of Richard McDonnell, said she “struggled with the weight of knowing who the father of Ann’s baby might be but was paralysed by it”.In a public Facebook post Ms Langan said she accidentally came across private correspondence belonging to her mother “that referred to my estranged father’s relationship with Ann Lovett”, along with a description of Ann’s death, two years before Ms Langan was born. “From then on, if I saw Ann’s name printed in a newspaper, my heart raced and my palms would sweat. I was overwhelmed with guilt, sadness and a profound shame.”Ms Langan said the more she researched Ann’s death, “the more I became convinced of some manner of a cover-up”. “I struggled with the weight of knowing who Ann’s baby’s father might be but was paralysed by it. I was unable to process or suppress the contemplation of the senseless loss of Ann’s life, the tragic, lonely stillbirth of what might have been my half-brother, the suffocating atmosphere of the town closing ranks, the silence.”On April 22nd, 1984, less than three months after Ann died, her sister Patricia, aged 14, died by suicide. “The silence surrounding this horrific tragedy has been an enormous burden on so many people,” Ms Langan said. “Three lives ended in a state of unthinkable desperation, and the trauma that stayed with those who cared about Ann and Patricia fuelled endless cycles of depression, alcoholism, self-harm, violence, self-destructive behaviour and sadly, suicides.“Remains and after-effects of this trauma have embedded themselves into the generation that followed Ann’s and my father’s. I have not yet begun to find a way to rid myself of this unshakeable sadness, this internal rage in all directions.“I am sure there are other young people my age connected to those in Granard who feel the same.”“I want to thank Rosita Boland for her important reporting on this story and for her kindness and sensitivity over the past few weeks.

Photograph: iStockGetty ImagesThe Save the 8th group, which is campaigning against the repeal of the Eighth Amendment, has defended the practice of allowing referendum campaigners to speak at Mass. It was responding to a statement from Association of Catholic Priests (ACP) which said the practice could be regarded by some Church-going Catholics as “inappropriate and insensitive” and “an abuse of the Eucharist”. The association said it was “concerned” that in the run up to the referendum on the Eighth Amendment, some parishes were allowing their pulpits to be used by campaigners. It said that while it fully endorses “the Catholic teaching that all human life, from beginning to end, is sacred”, it also recognises that “human life is complex, throwing up situations that are more often grey than black and white and that demand from us a sensitive, non-judgemental, pastoral approach.” “There is undoubtedly a moral content to this referendum, but as with many other issues, there are also social, political and pastoral dimensions.”It said that as as an association made up of unmarried, childless men, “we are not best placed to be in any way dogmatic on this issue”.The association said it encouraged people to find out what exactly they are being asked to vote for, and what the consequences of their vote may be. “Having done that to the best of our ability, and following it with the, often painful and difficult, task of consulting our conscience, let us cast our vote. “A vote cast in accordance with each person’s conscience, whatever the result, deserves the respect of all,” it said. The ACP is a voluntary association of Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland. It was established in 2010 with the objective of having “a forum, and a voice to reflect, discuss and comment on issues affecting the Irish Church and society today.” One of its founders, Fr Tony Flannery, was disciplined and banned from public ministry by the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2012 for views he expressed on Catholic teachings in areas such as sexuality, contraception and the role of women in the church.Save the 8th said it had been “delighted and honoured” to accept invitations to speak to congregations.“The Association of Catholic Priests appears to be worried that Catholics may hear Catholic teaching reflected at Catholic masses,” it said. The group said it would never decline an invitation “educate” voters about which it described as the “extremity of the Government’s proposal, which legalises abortion for healthy mothers, and healthy babies, for any reason at all”.Save the 8th said no-one was compelled by a church or its campaign to listen to any speaker.“If we have reached the point where speaking about the right to life in a Christian church is in some way controversial, that would be a sign that hysteria has overtaken rational discourse in this referendum campaign,” it said.“Our campaign shares, and applauds, the deep commitment of the Christian community to the values of respect for the life and dignity of every human inidual. These values and beliefs are not limited to people of faith, and are shared by people of no religion whatsoever.”Meanwhile, the Bishop of Meath Michael Smith said in a statement released to mark the feast day of Edmund Rice, founder of the Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers, that “despite suggestions to the contrary”, the Church asks that all necessary medical treatment be given to a mother in pregnancy even if this were to result in the unintended death of the child.He said highly respected medical and legal experts had made it clear that under the present law the best standards of care were available to mothers in a crisis pregnancy. “Are we as a society to say to women experiencing a crisis in their pregnancy that the solution to their concern is to be found in abortion? Does this show compassion and care for women? “The solution to a crisis pregnancy should be found in addressing the crisis, not in terminating the life of an innocent child. Abortion is a brutal act. There is no semblance of compassion involved in ending the life of the child in the womb.”He said it was difficult to imagine how such an action could be compatible with the Catholic faith in any way.He described abortion rates in other countries as “appalling” and said they should “fill us with the dread of similar rates becoming normalised here”. The power to decide “who lives and who dies” should not belong to the inidual, he said. “Saving the Eighth means that we do not have to choose between two competing rights. To choose life is to choose both.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484507.1525467832!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we consider ourselves pro life journalists in a kind of activist way","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNathan Berning and Emily Faulkner who are campaigning for a No vote in the referendum. Photograph: Dave MeehanA group of self-styled “pro-life activist journalists” have travelled from the US to lend their support to the anti-repeal side in the referendum on the Eight Amendment.The group, which runs an American pro-life organisation, says it plans to attend rallies by both sides, videoing them and putting the results online.Two activists, Emily Faulkner (23) and Nathan Berning (25), told The  they expect to be joined soon by seven associates.The pair live in Colorado where they run an anti-abortion organisation, LetThemLive.org, and are associated also with The Leadership Institute, a right-wing organisation in Virginia that seeks to recruit young people to conservative causes in the US.In an interview, they explained why they had come to Ireland and why they wanted to influence the referendum.Since announcing online last month that they were joining the retain campaign, they said they had been discouraged by “hateful” comments about them on Facebook. They were not working with any of the retain campaigns here, they said.“We haven’t had any success trying to connect with any of the pro-life organisations here,” said Mr Berning. “I think that’s mostly because there’s a fear it’s illegal for us to help them.”As a result, they had changed tack and would not be doing door-to-door canvassing, although they would do some “town centre” publicising, using images and diagrams showing development within the womb.“Our focus has shifted to being more journalist and documenting what happens so that we can show people back home,” said Mr Berning.Did this mean they saw themselves as journalists?“Absolutely!” said Ms Faulkner. “We do like to consider ourselves as pro-life journalists in like a kind of activist way.”Ms Faulkner, who says her family background is pro-life, studied biology and hopes to study gynaecology.“During my classes,” said Ms Faulkner, “we started talking about embryology and the beginning of life and I’m like ‘What! This is cool!’ Science is really amazing and I can fit that with my pro-life views.”Mr Berning said he was initially pro-choice in outlook until he went to college in Indiana, where he grew up.“There was a display of an aborted baby next to a penny, and I’m not sure what the age of the foetus was at that point, but I just saw it and it was very brutal to me and at first I think I was upset by the image,” he said.Both believe that life begins at the moment of conception and that abortion is wrong in all circumstances.Asked if they gave equal value to a fertilised egg, from the nanosecond after conception, and a 30-year-old woman, they said they did.“It has a unique DNA at the moment of conception,” said Mr Berning.Mr Berning: “It’s a person with potential.”“It is a human being. We were all there once,” said Ms Faulkner.Asked about the view of leading clinicians in Ireland that the Eighth Amendment has created legal uncertainty as to what they, as medics, can and cannot do, and is therefore a danger to women’s health, Ms Faulkner and Mr Berning said such situations were a tiny minority.What of the situation of a woman, whose pregnancy involved a fatal foetal abnormality incompatible with life, who wanted an abortion but could not get one in Ireland?“For us,” said Mr Berning, “I guess it comes down to, the percentage of the likelihood of something like that happening is so low, we don’t believe that you should legislate for that less than 1 per cent of pregnancies when it risks the 99 per cent.“There’s been over 100,000 abortions prevented in Ireland, if you compare it with the UK.”He computed this figure by calculating the number of abortions he estimates would have taken place in Ireland since 1983, had abortion been permitted here during that period and abortion rates been the same as the UK.No woman need be denied any medical treatment because of the Eighth, said Ms Faulkner. If in treating cancer, or dealing with an ectopic pregnancy, a foetus was adversely affected, that was not the intention and there was therefore “no direct killing of a child in the womb”.And as for competing but equal rights (as the amendment enunciates for both the unborn and the mother), a doctor should decide treatment, said Mr Berning, on the basis of “which life is more likely to survive and continue”.“From the medical perspective, that would be what I would argue to be the way to look at it,” he said. “Because, if the mother is about to die, then you should work to save the child. If the child is about to die and the mother has a chance of survival, then you work to save the mother. That’s pretty simple stuff.”On the case of Savita Halappanavar, who was refused an abortion during a miscarriage because of uncertainty relating to the amendment and who died of sepsis (blood poisoning), Ms Faulkner said the role of medics was relevant in the case also.“So if there was just a little bit more care . . . No need to legalise abortion but a little bit more care and attention.”“It’s an unfortunate reality that, you know, these things happen. People do die. It’s just part of life, I guess. That risk is always there,” he said.The pair, who are staying in an Airbnb in Tipperary, will this weekend attend a round of campaign events in Dublin.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484163.1525431259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bertie ahern s post politics decade you get the impression he really misses it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Ahern’s standing within Fianna Fáil – he resigned his membership in 2012 in advance of a move to expel him because of the findings of the Mahon Tribunal – remains a pebble in his shoe.   Photograph: David Sleator Bertie Ahern’s haunts are mostly still the same: Croke Park, Parnell Park – the home of Dublin GAA – and some pubs around the north side of Dublin where he toured throughout his political career.Yet some slight differences have emerged in the habits of the former taoiseach since he stood down from office a decade ago.Despite occasional appearances in Fagan’s – the Drumcondra pub which has framed pictures and newspaper clippings of Ahern and Bill Clinton toasting each other on its walls – he is said to no longer be a regular, but may occasionally make an appearance.“The lads behind the bar say it: ‘Never comes in anymore’,” said a local source. “He was last spotted there on All-Ireland final day.”A hostile atmosphere during the worst years of the recession perhaps encouraged Ahern to be cautious in where he socialises. He is now said to favour the discreet bar in the soccer club Home Farm. “The place would be empty – seven or eight people – but the Bert will be in there,” said another local. “I think he uses it for privacy.”The Goose Tavern and the Beaumont House still count on his regular custom, usually with old friends who have remained “100 per cent” loyal, according to those who know them.But – after years in which Bertie Ahern was viewed as something of a pariah – those around north Dublin detect a renewed confidence in Ahern as his reputation has improved. “When you see him coming out of Parnell Park now, there is a pep in his step even compared to two years ago. His head is held up high, he has a bit of the swagger back.”His interventions on Northern Ireland issues and Brexit have helped to rehabilitate him, although a recent interview with German television – which he walked out of when questions turned to the Mahon tribunal and his stewardship of the economy – served as a reminder that the most contentious issues of his past have not gone away.Speaking to The , Ahern himself says most criticism of him by members of the public in the years after his retirement mostly centred on the economy. “In the heat of the recession in 2009 and 2010, people would say: ‘If you had have done this or that’.” Issues around the tribunal, he says, are raised with him “very, very rarely”.Friends say a “bit of pride” meant Ahern was reluctant to discuss how his reputation had been damaged. “Even during the height of the recession, and at the peak of when he was getting stick, if you asked him about that, he’d never really admit it,” said one.But one particular memory from his days at the tribunal in Dublin Castle lingers around north Dublin, and will not be easily forgotten.The intricacies of his personal finances – aside from an easily mocked claim that he won significant sums betting on horses – have largely passed beyond common memory, but the treatment of Gráinne Carruth has not.Carruth, Ahern’s former constituency secretary who broke down while giving evidence about lodging thousands of pounds in sterling for her former boss, now lives with her family in a renovated St Luke’s, the former taoiseach’s Drumcondra base which she bought in 2015.“Even when people see him talking about Brexit and the Good Friday Agreement you’d still hear: ‘What about Gráinne Carruth and what he did to her?’” said a local.Ahern still keeps an office in Drumcondra, in modest rooms in a small business park. Most meetings are held across the road in the lobby or bar of the Skylon Hotel.He has been busy since leaving office. He briefly took to the after-dinner-speaking circuit and was on the boards of a few private sector companies but has largely focused on the area of conflict resolution, where his achievements are beyond dispute.Such pro bono work includes: spells with the World Economic Forum’s advisory group on conflict resolution the Clinton Global Initiative as a facilitator with Crisis Management Initiative, which saw him taking part in peace talks in Ukraine the Inter Mediate group established by Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief adviser and a period as co-chair of the InterAction Council of former world leaders.Ahern has also formed associations with various academic institutions including receiving an honorary professorship from NUI Maynooth. This week, he was in the Basque Country to mark the end of Eta, another step in a peace process to which he, along with others such as Gerry Adams, contributed.Recently, he has also been asked by the United Nations to chair Bougainville’s referendum commission ahead of a vote next year on whether the region should be independent of Papau New Guinea. Back home, he has helped settle disputes between the GAA and organisations in north Dublin.But Ahern’s standing within Fianna Fáil – he resigned his membership in 2012 in advance of a move to expel him because of the findings of the Mahon tribunal – remains a pebble in his shoe.His possible re-entry into the party was raised as recently as last Wednesday night at a Dublin Central Comhairle Dáil Ceantair meeting. According to sources, an elderly delegate said that in order to secure a Dáil seat for Mary Fitzpatrick, the current Dublin Central candidate who clashed with Ahern on numerous occasions, the party should recruit all the help it could get, including allowing Ahern back.Ahern was sounded out about the prospect but cautioned against opening up such a contentious issue at this point. Micheál Martin shot down a similar proposal in November 2016, but many in the party would take Ahern back in a heartbeat.Last month, at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil national executive, talk turned to the prospect of the party standing a candidate in the presidential election – if there is to be one – later this year.Der Walsh, the delegate for Martin’s own Cork South Central constituency, told his leader that if the party is serious about standing for the presidency, it should send for Ahern. Unsurprisingly, Martin didn’t address the question.The current Fianna Fáil leader has a strained relationship with Ahern, who in turn finds it difficult to mask his dislike for the man he first appointed to Cabinet in 1997.Ahern’s occasional flirtations with a run for the presidency may be designed to cause trouble for Martin, or are a way of keeping his name connected with the Phoenix Park, in the off-chance that events turn his way.But friends insist he just wants his views on politics respected within the party he gave 40 years to. “I think he’d like to do the same around the party as he does with Brexit and the North,” says a friend, “to give advice”.“I don’t think he wants to run for office again. He was 40-odd years a member of the party. Most of his friends and most of his life has been around the party. I think he’d love to be of help. He doesn’t want to be on the frontline.”Ahern himself says: “If I was still in Fianna Fáil, the only thing I’d be doing would be in the local cumann.”To those around Ahern, the recent celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement offered the perfect opportunity for Martin to make a generous gesture of rapprochement.While Martin praised Ahern’s contributions to the peace process, it was felt that Fianna Fáil was attempting to claim credit for its achievements while continuing to disown one of its chief architects.“I have heard people in Fianna Fáil say: ‘We are the party of the Good Friday Agreement.’ You know Yeats’s famous line, how do you separate the dancer from the dance? Well, they are trying to do that.”As to when Ahern could return to Fianna Fáil fold, one supporter is blunt: “As soon as your man from Cork is gone.”All who encounter Ahern testify to his ongoing, intense interest in politics, from constituency level upwards.While he “f***ing hates Micheál Martin”, said one in regular contact with him, he is said to have a regard for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “He sees Leo as the same style of politician as himself.”“Bert still has the glint in his eye, the word for all the auld ones: ‘How yis doin girls? That type of thing.’ He still has a great grá for the day job. You get the impression he really misses it.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483261.1525444227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"judging bertie ahern we all partied but he served the drinks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBertie Ahern: will his achievements be eclipsed by his shortcomings?

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000161950242_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqTpQNkEsZM9dtjYvDPpd1c7_E-p5K6IxFuscdlk0yspA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc asked pregnant presenter work day baby due","story":" Tim Wilcox,Joanna Gosling and David Eades Arts and Entertainment EditorThe BBC asked a pregnant presenter to work on the day her baby was due and attempted to cut her pay once she returned from maternity leave, a court has heard.Joanna Gosling, a regular face on the BBC\u0027s news channels for almost 20 years, broke down during a tribunal as she accused the corporation of operating a two-tier system in which some stars are lavished with benefits while the rest are left with no job security.While viewers may have assumed that Ms Gosling was a member of BBC staff, in fact she has never been given a permanent job.She has never received maternity pay, holiday pay, sick pay or pension, and is currently on a contract that allows bosses to sack her without reason.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

which is already under fire for failing to remove terrorist material from its platform - is now accused of actively connecting jihadists around the world, allowing them to develop fresh terror networks and even recruit new members to their cause.Researchers, who analysed the Facebook activities of a thousand Isil supporters in 96 countries, discovered users with radical Islamist sympathies were routinely introduced to one another through the popular \u0027suggested friends\u0027 feature.Using sophisticated algorithms, Facebook is designed to connect people who share common interests.The site automatically collects a vast amount of personal information about its users, which is then used to target advertisements and also direct people towards others on the network they might wish to connect with.But without effective checks on what information is being shared, terrorists are able to exploit the site to contact and communicate with sympathisers and supporters.Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has used social media for propaganda purposesThe extent to which the ‘suggested friend’ feature is helping Isil members on Facebook is highlighted in a new study, the findings of which will be published later this month in an extensive report by the Counter Extremism Project a non profit that has called on tech companies to do more to remove known extremist and terrorist material online.Gregory Waters, one of the authors of the report, described how he was bombarded by suggestions for pro-Isil friends, after making contact with one active extremist on the site.Even more concerning was the response his fellow researcher, Robert Postings, got when he clicked on several non-extremist news pages about an Islamist uprising in the Philippines.Within hours he had been inundated with friend suggestions for dozens of extremists based in that region.Mr Postings said: Facebook, in their desire to connect as many people as possible have inadvertently created a system which helps connect extremists and terrorists.”Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has vowed to tackle terrorist material on the siteOnce initial introductions are made the failure of Facebook to tackle extremist content on the site means Jihadists can quickly radicalise susceptible targets.In one example uncovered by the researchers, an Indonesian Isil supporter sent a friend request to a non-Muslim user in New York in March 2017.During the initial exchange the American user explained that he was not religious , but had an interest in Islam.Over the following weeks and months the Indonesian user began sending increasingly radical messages and links including pro-Isil propaganda, all of which were liked by his target.The study also examined the extent to which Facebook was failing to tackle terrorist material on its site.Of the 1,000 Isil supporting profiles examined by researchers, less than half of the accounts had been suspended by Facebook six months later.Facebook has said there is no place for terrorists on its siteMr Posting said: Removing profiles that disseminate IS propaganda, calls for attacks and otherwise support the group is important...the fact that the majority of pro-IS profiles in this database have gone unremoved by Facebook is exceptionally concerning.Even when terrorist material was identified and the offending posts removed, the user was often allowed to remain on the site.There have also been numerous examples of pro-Isil accounts being reinstated after the user complained to moderators about their suspension.In one case a British terror suspect had his Facebook account reinstated nine times after complaining, despite being accused of having posted sick Isil propaganda videos.Mr Waters said: This project has laid bare Facebook\u0027s inability or unwillingness to efficiently address extremist content on their site.The failure to effectively police its platform has allowed Facebook to become a place where extensive IS supporting networks exist, propaganda is disseminated people are radicalised and new supporters are recruited.Islamic State supporters have been introduced to one another on FacebookMr Postings added: “Even when profiles or content is removed, it is not always done fast enough, allowing Isil content to be to be widely share and viewed before getting removed.”Mr Waters said: “The fact that Facebook\u0027s own recommended friends algorithm is directly facilitating the spread of this terrorist group on its site is beyond unacceptable.Simon Hart, a Conservative MP who sits on Culture Media and Sport Select Committee, said: The idea that Facebook is inadvertently providing an introduction service for terrorists is quite extraordinary. It is another terrifying example of the unintended consequences of this sort of technology.If you design a system for one thing and it becomes another it is hard to police.Nobody will have set out to provide a network for terrorists to connect, but the important thing is how Facebook responds now this matter has been raised with them.A spokesman for Facebook  said: There is no place for terrorists on Facebook. We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism.We have and will continue to invest millions of pounds in both people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content.Comment: The Iran nuclear deal was based on lies and is untenableMinisters urged to demand answers from Qatar over its alleged support for terrorismJeremy Corbyn warned he could keep Labour out of office for another decade if he fails on BrexitTory MPs threaten to \u0026#39throw the kitchen sink\u0026#39 at John Bercow Comment: Parliament should reject Brexit game-playing and accept the country’s decisionBritain must wake up to \u0026#39folly\u0026#39 of trusting Iran over nuclear deal – Israeli ambassador Britain’s Got Talent episode 4: have we met the hipster Michael Bublé?Universities struggle to recruit top students as schools \u0026#39mercilessly push\u0026#39 Russell Group to pupilsSocial media is fuelling a surge in graffitiPassengers compare scene inside Caribbean cruise ship to the Titanic after 50 rooms were flooded US condemns China for \u0026#39Orwellian nonsense\u0026#39 after Beijing writes to 36 airlines over Taiwan references\u0026#39Drunk\u0026#39 United Airlines stewardess disrupts flight with foul-mouthed rantJunior doctor recruitment chaos as hundreds forced to apply for jobs starting in monthsWelsh landowner grows Britain\u0026#39s first crop of world\u0026#39s most sought-after trufflesDonald Trump\u0026#39s letters to David Cameron complaining wind farms were \u0026#39blighting\u0026#39 the landscape in ScotlandSpectre of Isil looms large over Mosul as Iraq heads to the pollsRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny among more than 1,600 arrested during anti-Putin protests Pulitzer prize winning author accused of sexual impropriety and misogynyIran \u0026#39could dump nuclear deal and restart enrichment\u0026#39 if Donald Trump pulls outThe mystery of the fire in the woods and the Bechstein\u0026#39s batsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/04/TELEMMGLPICT000161953438_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYbHyc_BzkV-wGdElElElaDJDzZ0ANirTOCm-VMfUfbA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"iran nuclear deal based should scrapped","story":"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presents secret documents and files from Iran\u0026#39s nuclear archiveLast Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed a vast repository of over 100,000 documents and files that Israeli intelligence obtained from Iran’s secret nuclear archive in Tehran.The documents include official letters, spreadsheets, blueprints, photographs, videos and more, all attesting to the Iranian regime’s clandestine plans to build nuclear weapons. One document proclaimed an ominous mission statement for the covert programme: to ‘design, produce and test five warheads, each with ten kiloton TNT yield for integration on a missile.’ That is like five Hiroshima bombs.The American government received this significant intelligence weeks ago, and has attested to its authenticity. We are now sharing this information with the United Kingdom.Under the terms of the nuclear deal, Iran committed to coming clean about all prior military nuclear activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

On the contrary, the deal contains three significant pitfalls that, if left unresolved, pave a clear path for the regime to build nuclear weapons. Firstly, the deal allows Iran to continue to develop ballistic missiles. Over the past decade, Iran has enthusiastically expanded its arsenal of missiles, increasing their range from 1,000km to approximately 2,000km. Not satisfied with simply being able to threaten my country and other nations nearby, Iran is planning to further extend the range of its missiles, enabling them to reach cities in Europe. The second major pitfall of the deal is that the inspection mechanism is wholly inadequate. Iran has never declared its enrichment facilities voluntarily, having only admitted to their existence after another source had already revealed them. This was true of the uranium enrichment sites in Natanz in 2002 and Fordow in 2009.  Currently, any declared Iranian military base is off-limits to inspectors. For a regime intent on concealing an illicit nuclear weapons programme, such an arrangement is extraordinarily convenient.Children in Eastern Ghouta, Syria, in March. Iran is accused of propping up the Assad regimeThe third major pitfall is that the deal’s restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities expire in just a few short years. Then, Iran will be free to enrich unlimited quantities of uranium, using hundreds of thousands of centrifuges. This sunset clause will reward the regime for its deceit.Proponents of the deal have claimed that it would better to integrate the Islamic Republic into the global community and encourage Iran to act more responsibly. Yet, three years after the deal was reached, the regime’s actions have proven the very opposite to be true.Iran’s oppression of political dissenters and minorities has only worsened. Last December, thousands were arrested when the authorities clamped down violently on a wave of nationwide protests. In February, the regime jailed 29 women for standing up for their freedom.The Islamic Republic’s neighbours are increasingly suffering, as the regime exploits the economic benefits of the deal to fund its nefarious activities in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.In Syria, Tehran continues to prop up the brutal dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, supporting its murderous onslaught against civilians and its use of chemical weapons.Furthermore, Iran is actively funding, training and arming terror groups such as Hizbollah and Hamas, as well as sectarian militias across the Middle East..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Preventing nuclear proliferation is only possible if we robustly confront Tehran’s covert nuclear activity, halt its ballistic missile programme, and condition the lifting of restrictions upon a tangible change in Iranian behaviourThis continued encroachment and aggression, along with the three major pitfalls in the 2015 agreement, and the dramatic new revelations from Iran’s nuclear archive, all attest to the folly of basing our common security upon Iranian duplicity and mendacity.Preventing Iranian nuclear proliferation is only possible if we robustly confront Tehran’s covert nuclear activity, halt its ballistic missile programme, and condition the lifting of restrictions upon a tangible change in Iranian behaviour.Prime Minister Netanyahu is not the only leader to criticise the 2015 agreement as a ‘terrible deal’. Throughout the Middle East, Arab leaders have expressed identical concerns.The world does not tend to expect Israelis and Arabs to find common cause. When Iran’s neighbours – Arab and Israeli alike – agree that the Iranian nuclear deal is untenable, people in the United Kingdom should sit up and take notice.Please review our commenting policyFacebook accused of introducing extremists to one another through \u0026#39suggested friends\u0026#39 featureBritain must wake up to \u0026#39folly\u0026#39 of trusting Iran over nuclear deal – Israeli ambassador Ministers urged to demand answers from Qatar over its alleged support for terrorismJeremy Corbyn warned he could keep Labour out of office for another decade if he fails on BrexitTory MPs threaten to \u0026#39throw the kitchen sink\u0026#39 at John Bercow Comment: Parliament should reject Brexit game-playing and accept the country’s decisionBritain’s Got Talent episode 4: have we met the hipster Michael Bublé?Universities struggle to recruit top students as schools \u0026#39mercilessly push\u0026#39 Russell Group to pupilsSocial media is fuelling a surge in graffitiPassengers compare scene inside Caribbean cruise ship to the Titanic after 50 rooms were flooded US condemns China for \u0026#39Orwellian nonsense\u0026#39 after Beijing writes to 36 airlines over Taiwan references\u0026#39Drunk\u0026#39 United Airlines stewardess disrupts flight with foul-mouthed rantJunior doctor recruitment chaos as hundreds forced to apply for jobs starting in monthsWelsh landowner grows Britain\u0026#39s first crop of world\u0026#39s most sought-after trufflesDonald Trump\u0026#39s letters to David Cameron complaining wind farms were \u0026#39blighting\u0026#39 the landscape in ScotlandSpectre of Isil looms large over Mosul as Iraq heads to the pollsRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny among more than 1,600 arrested during anti-Putin protests Pulitzer prize winning author accused of sexual impropriety and misogynyIran \u0026#39could dump nuclear deal and restart enrichment\u0026#39 if Donald Trump pulls outThe mystery of the fire in the woods and the Bechstein\u0026#39s batsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/05/TELEMMGLPICT000162187133_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"social media fuelling surge graffiti","story":"Graffiti on trains has hit an eight year highSocial media is fuelling a resurgence in graffiti as artists compete for recognition and fame by posting photographs of their work online often without worrying that the original will be destroyed or painted over.New “high-tech graffiti artists” are using picture websites like Instagram to gain global recognition, as well as technology such as drones that serve as lookouts to try to prevent police catching them.Graffiti on trains has hit an eight-year high in the UK, with many images then being posted on social media. In the first quarter of 2018 there were 399 graffiti attacks on trains, the highest quarterly figure since the first quarter of 2010, according to figures obtained from the British Transport Police using Freedom of information laws.The surge in graffiti on the railway networks has forced the British Transport Police to reintroduce a dedicated CID team to specifically investigate graffiti crime.Trains operated by Southeastern Rail have been among those most frequently targeted by graffiti artists.Social media is allegedly fuelling the rise in graffitiWe’ve seen a more-than-doubling in the number of large mural-type graffiti attacks on our trains over the last three months, and that this is something that other train operators are experiencing too,” a spokesman for the company said in a statement.“We’re working closely with the British Transport Police to tackle the issues.“They’ve stepped up patrols and recently reintroduced a dedicated investigation team to identify the perpetrators and take appropriate criminal action.“Network Rail are also bringing in extra security to patrol and secure the network.”Experts say that the trend is being driven by new technology and the rise of social media, with artists using remote-controlled drones to avoid detection and attempting to outdo each other in daring videos that document their crimes and are posted online.“Instagram has completely changed the game,” says Darren Cullen, a former graffiti writer who is now owner and director of Graffiti Kings, a company that runs spray can art workshops for young people.“Now graffiti artists aren’t discouraged by the fact that their work might be painted over as soon as it is finished.“Even if no one ever sees it in real life - you can still take photos and reach a huge audience instantly through social media.”Graffiti cases are soaring across the UKSeveral UK graffiti Instagram accounts have thousands of followers and allow graffiti writers to compete for recognition by showing proof of the quality of their art as well as their increasing appetite for risk.The independent graffiti magazine UKFrontline has more than 16,800 followers on Instagram and the images it posts, which mainly document graffiti on trains around Britain, regularly get thousands of views from around the world.Some of the videos posted on Instagram and on YouTube show freshly painted artworks, while others show groups of graffiti writers, with their faces covered, in action as they paint on train carriages.Painting murals illegally on trains has been the goal since modern graffiti culture was forged in New York in the 1980s, but large multi-colour artworks have rarely been seen on UK trains following a crackdown on prolific graffiti artists in the 90s, according to Joe Epstein, an author and photographer who has documented graffiti and street art in London since 2006.“Over the last few years it has started to become a regular occurrence,” he said. “It’s quite extraordinary because five years ago people would always talk about what was done on trains in the 90s and say it is pretty much unachievable these days.”One factor that has tipped the balance in favour of graffiti writers are cuts to police budgets, something that has reduced resources available for investigating criminal damage incidents.Graffiti artists are using drones to chose targetsGraffiti writers have also embraced modern technology to avoid capture, including drones fitted with video cameras, which are used to monitor train yards before the vandals break in and paint a train.“Drones are being used a lot,” said one graffiti writer who spoke on condition of anonymity.“It’s not uncommon to visit spots regularly for months, watching the trains to see where they stop and for how long – timing them so you know how long you’ve got.”There were 800 graffiti crimes that targeted trains over the whole of 2017, an increase of 49 per cent compared to a low of 537 in 2013.If the trend continues British Transport Police will record more graffiti incidents on trains in the UK this year than any other year since 2008.Graffiti artists are posting their work onlineAnnual graffiti attacks on associated infrastructure, such as train lines and stations, has also steadily increased, nearly doubling since 2013.The biggest increases in graffiti on trains have been recorded in the regions patrolled by British Transport Police’s South East of England subision and its Transport for London subision.In 2017 the number of graffiti crimes on trains in the South East of England was 78 per cent higher than in 2013, while the number of crimes targeting Transport for London trains were up by 51 per cent.Efforts by Southeastern Rail to quickly clean graffiti off trains has been hampered by a £5 million improvement programme, which is taking place over the next 6-9 months.“In the short-term we’re taking the approach that passengers would prefer a train in service with graffiti on it, than one cancelled,” a spokesman said.A spokesperson for Transport for London said that its ability to combat graffiti had not been impacted by cuts and any increase in the visibility of graffiti on its trains is due to the rise in activity by graffiti writers that target its trains.No one from Instagram was available for comment.Facebook accused of introducing extremists to one

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

Karl Marx with his eldest daughter. His writings became a fundamental basis for revolutionary movements across the globe, particularly the Russian Revolution that led to the creation of the Soviet Union.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century.

Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall. He argued for the establishment of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” through which workers would become the dominant class.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

These trials have been shown up to be the chaotic, undemocratic mess many predicted.“These findings are exactly what many feared: that this draconian measure would result in blameless iniduals being disenfranchised. It is vital moving forward that these draconian trials are not a fait accompli for a national rollout.”The figures did not take into account whether voters came back with the correct ID having initially been turned away. It is also impossible to know how many people were put off from entering a polling station altogether because of the new ID requirements.Democracy Volunteers, the UK’s largest election observer group, collated the figures while carrying out extensive observations of the ID checks in 243 polling stations across the five areas the scheme was being piloted.John Ault, director of the organisation, told The Independent 10 voters had been turned away within a 45-minute period at one polling station in Swindon, and that the issue appeared to disproportionately affect ethnic minority voters.British voters furious at being denied right to cast ballot over ID“Obviously there were always going to be teething problems, but I also think quite clearly that if you – whether intentionally or otherwise – exclude 1.5 to 2 per cent of the population, that is a significant problem,” he said.“The process was quite well run. Staff were welcoming and generally helpful, they tried to assist people who didn’t realise they were required to bring ID.“But the problem is some people clearly weren’t able to produce it, and we don’t know how many people didn’t come because they didn’t have it in the first place.”Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, clamed it was “impossible” for the government to justify rolling out the scheme.“After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote,” she said.“We cannot allow the Conservative Party to undermine our democracy, which is why Labour is calling on the government to scrap its voter ID plans as a matter of urgency.”Campaigners had questioned the evidence on which the trials were based. Figures from the Electoral Commission show there were just 28 allegations of impersonation in 2017 out of nearly 45 million votes – or one case for every 1.6 million votes cast. Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.Senior officials in trial areas expressed their concerns about the trials, while the government was criticised by the UK Statistics Authority for pushing misleading figures to support the need for the pilots.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsA government spokesperson insisted the pilots had been a “success”.“Voter ID is an important step to ensuring the public can have greater confidence in our democratic system and the success of yesterday’s pilots proves that this is a reasonable and proportionate measure to take,” he said.“The overwhelming majority of people cast their vote without a problem. We will evaluate the pilots before announcing the next steps in delivering voter ID nationally. As well as this, the independent Electoral Commission will conduct a planned evaluation of the pilots.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

It must be removed now.”Lucy Jones, of Doctors of the World, which works closely with undocumented migrants, said: “We regularly see patients, often in urgent need of medical care, who are too afraid to go to NHS services fearing their information will be shared across government. The exemption makes this fear an absolute reality.”And Adrian Berry, chairman of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, highlighted how lawyers for migrants would no longer be able to obtain their files using “subject access requests”.“The impact the exemption will have on curtailing access to personal data therefore goes to the very heart of access to justice and the preservation of the rule of law,” he warned.Amnesty, the Refugee Council, the National Aids Trust, the National Education Union, Privacy International and the trade union Unison are among the other organisations which have signed the letter, sent to Sajid Javid, the new home secretary.The Independent revealed last October that the exemption in the data protection bill would remove data privacy rights for immigration investigations.May should let parliament decide what to do about the customs unionVince Cable: ‘Theresa May will fight the next election’Theresa May ‘vetoed plan for overseas doctors to fill NHS gaps’Tory rebels vow to force May to reveal ‘tainted money’ in tax havensNew home sec says May’s ‘hostile’ immigration rhetoric not BritishHowever, the controversy has grown in the wake of the Windrush scandal – prompting the crucial amendment, put down by Labour and the Lib Dems, to be debated on Wednesday.The prime minister was accused of being in denial about the issue, when she told MPs recently: “It will be possible for people to access the information that they need.”In reality, the bill clearly states the rights to personal data “do not apply” where that conflicts with “the maintenance of effective immigration control” or “the investigation” of suspected immigration offences.Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, told The Independent: “This is completely against the British traditions of justice and the rule of law. It is an odious proposal.“If Theresa May doesn’t change her mind on this, no one will be able to take seriously a word she has said since Windrush. This is the first test.”The Home Office made “a lot of mistakes”, Mr Davey said – sometimes trying to deport “completely the wrong person” – which were only thwarted by the right to open up files.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said the policy was a “continuation of the government’s hostile environment policy”, adding: “Given the government’s track record in this area there no guarantee that it would exercise any exemption properly or proportionately.“Labour will support measures to delete this exemption from the bill when it returns to the Commons next week.”The Home Office has insisted the right to request data “will be met in all cases except where to do so could undermine our immigration control”.A spokesperson said: “They will have the right to complain to the information commissioner if they disagree with any use of the immigration exemption and we would always want to assist those whose claims are in question.”However, lawyers have rejected that right to appeal, warning a person would probably have been deported before a ruling came through.After his appointment last week, Mr Javid dropped the use of the “hostile environment” phrase – favoured by the prime minister – but has yet to say he will change the policies behind it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

How would EU partnership work?The research, by Rob Ford and Maria Sobolewska, admitted predicting exactly how the electorate will look in the future is impossible.And they acknowledged their forecasts \u0026ldquomake the unrealistic assumption that nothing else will change.But they said their study did serve to show \u0026ldquothe Brexit majority is fragile and on the wrong side of powerful demographic pressures.By projecting \u0026ldquorobust and well established demographic trends, the two academics from the University of Manchester predicted there could be enough support to overturn the Brexit vote, if another were held, by the end of the transition period.Changes in the UK\u0027s population is likely to lead to the electorate becoming more pro-RemainThe pair identified three key factors which they said are likely to give rise to a Remain majority - an increasing education level, more ethnic ersity and \u0026ldquogenerational change.The study cites data collected by the National Centre for Social Research which found people most likely to have voted Leave were those who either left school after their CSEs or O-levels, or had no formal education or qualifications.Professor Ford and Dr Sobolewska used this data, along with figures which show more and more young people are attending university, to estimate changes in education alone would result in two percent less support for Brexit by 2021.By 2026, they projected it would result in four percent fewer Leave voters.Rising education levels will tend to pull the electorate towards a pro-EU majority, the study saidThe pair also determined changes in the attitudes of voters would likely result in a change to the Brexit vote.Those who were of voting age before Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973 were much more likely to vote for Brexit, the academics found.They said: \u0026ldquoWhile voters\u0026rsquo attitudes can change as they age, there is a lot of evidence that the different conditions prevalent when generations come of age have a lasting impact on their values, and that younger cohorts generally have more socially liberal and cosmopolitan outlooks.\u0026ldquoGenerational replacement is therefore likely to slowly pull attitudes in a more liberal direction, with older, more socially conservative cohorts who came of age before Britain joined the EU slowly fading away, while new socially liberal and cosmopolitan young voters, who have no memory of a Britain outside of the EU, join the electorate.The electorate of 2021 will be made up of fewer people who were of voting age in the pre-EEC daysTheir study, for the think-tank UK in a Changing Europe, projected that by 2021, generational change will have resulted in two percent less support for Brexit, and three percent less by 2026.However, Professor Ford and Dr Sobolewska also found that despite the predicted demographic shift towards a Remain-backing majority, the changes might not necessarily be enough for the Brexit vote to be overturned if another referendum was held.They said: \u0026ldquoBrexit has also changed views about the status quo \u0026ndash many of those who backed Remain believe the result of the referendum should be respected and would not support a complete reversal of the Brexit process.\u0026ldquoMany in the rising europhile demographic groups would instead prefer to see Britain outside the EU but closely aligned with it.\u0026ldquoWhile \u0026lsquohard\u0026rsquo Brexiteers look to be on the wrong side of demographic trends, a softer form of Brexit could \u0026ndash all else being equal \u0026ndash enjoy broader and more sustainable support in the long run."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/364704.jpg","title":"local elections 2018 Owen Jones Andrew Neil Labour Party news","story":"Mr Jones visited four London boroughs yesterday as part of his campaign, all of which were key Labour targets.However, Kensington, Westminster and Wandsworth were all held by the Tories, while Theresa May\u0027s party actually won in Barnet, taking the council from no overall control.Journalist Andrew Neil tweeted \u0026ldquothis made me chuckle to a Spectator article which highlighted the Owen Jones effect at the local elections.The article reads: \u0026ldquo columnist has been taking his campaign to key Labour target seats.\u0026bullTWITTEROwen Jones visited four boroughs on Saturday -

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats the message of these local elections around the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.The PM added: We wont take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.Earlier Mr Corbyn held a rally in Plymouth, where Labour won the council in one of its few major victories of the local elections.He insisted that the story of the night was Ukip losing ground - and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:A Labour shadow minister told The Sun last night: “Jeremy has not spent the 11 months since the General Election winning Middle England, and now never will.We’re not going to do as well as we should, and I suspect these results will show we are past peak Corbyn.”Speaking in Plymouth, the Labour leader was asked if Britain has reached peak Corbyn and replied: No, no, theres much more to come and its going to get even better.Asked why Labour had failed to make the predicted gains, Mr Corbyn said: The story of the night is that Ukip have collapsed across the country, that we have gained in Plymouth.We have also put up our vote in a lot of other places and gained wards weve never held before in some of the London boroughs.Were ready for a General Election whenever it comes.In a statement he added: Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.His deputy Tom Watson insisted the party was quietly satisfied by the result.Labours other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.In Birmingham, a traditionally Labour-dominated city, the Tories did better than expected, prompting suggestions they could take control, but Labour ended up hanging on.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.Labour MP Jess Phillips took aim at her leader this morning, tweeting:  I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.Boris Johnson added: No one is going to be complacent about these results, we are going to work very, very hard... [but] it has been an encouraging night.With all but a handful of councils declared, Labour had gained 64 wards and the Lib Dems 61, with the Tories losing 20 - and Ukip almost totally wiped out.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Kingston and Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.Leader Vince Cable added: Were very much on the way back.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout today, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40 per cent of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield city region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000296276516.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ex army general lord richards defence spending","story":"The declining power of Britain’s military is giving off a signal of weakness, Lord Richards said yesterday.Issuing his siren alarm, the Army general insisted enemies such as Russia “will call our bluff” and mount an attack on the UK or our allies.The peer told The House magazine: “It’s got to be substantial amounts of money that the government must spend on the Armed Forces over the next ten years, if they’re to provide the influence on a day-to-day basis that we need in the post-Brexit era.“If there is any doubt about that, then the chances of conflict are increased because our opponents will call our bluff or seek to call our bluff.“Some of what I’m seeing suggests that we are getting perilously close to that.”Aggressive Russian president Vladimir Putin will pose the biggest test to Britain’s military resolve, he added.Lord Richards said: “If all countries continue not to invest in their Armed Forces over the next few years, then there will be a risk that Russian and other adventurism will catch us out.”While declaring he is “very pleased” with new Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s fight for more forces cash, the ex-Chief of Defence Staff said “the jury is out” on whether he will be a good forces boss.Lord Richards added: “He loses nothing by doing his job, which is to push the case for more spending on the Armed Forces.“It’s whether or not he succeeds that will determine one’s judgment.”Downing Street hit back at the general’s criticisms.The PM’s spokesman said: “We don’t agree. The defence budget is increasing to make sure we have the armed forces we need to defend the country”.More than 150 faced having to leave if they did not pay a £2,389 visas bill.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have proven that my work is not yet finished.Im really sorry but I find this really insulting. Im not here to go on TV to find love. I dont like it when people find love for me.Just because we have conditions or syndromes, we should not be called Undateable - Im very insulted by this.My campaign is raising awareness on bullying and facial disfigurements.The show is not the platform that Im looking to promote my campaign, I fully understand that youre doing your job but we are doing ours as well.We should not have named shows, if the show had a different name, I may reconsider the idea.I feel for the people who go on as I feel like they feel pressured into doing the show, they may not feel uncomfortable with doing the show, I certainly wouldnt feel happy with finding love on TV and someone doing it for me.Perceptions need to change and I think now is the time to do something about this.My campaign is raising awareness for bullying and raising awareness on Treacher Collins Syndrome.When were approached by researchers for shows and journalists for stories it can be an upsetting time.I might get snubbed by future production teams who make programmes for Channel 4, ITV and BBC.Couple of my friends have been approached and they dont like the program, nor do I due to the name.We are not and should not be called UNDATEABLE.We are all amazing and should be treated with care and love.Not for me this time, but if you could pass my details to other teams who might be working on programmes that suit my cause.Look forward to your reply.Im really sorry but I find this really insulting. Im not here to go on TV to find love. I dont like it when people find love for me.Just because we have conditions or syndromes, we should not be called Undateable - Im very insulted by this.He added: We are normal people living an amazing life.The programme claims to follow new singletons with a variety of conditions through the high and lows of finding love.However, critics of the show say it perpetuates stereotypes about people living with disabilities and other conditions.The show is not the platform that Im looking to promote my campaign, I fully understand that youre doing your job but we are doing ours as well.We should not have named shows, if the show had a different name, I may reconsider the idea.A spokesman for the show said: “When looking for contributors for this much-commended show the production team approach a wide number of individuals, experts and charities and nobody who is approached is assumed to be single or deemed to be ‘undateable’ but rather we hope they will help us spread the word reaching people who may like to take part.Those who have previously appeared have spoken overwhelmingly in support of the programme and have found it a really positive experience.”"},{"url":null,"title":"love stories consent apps","story":"It’s been reported that, in the era of #MeToo, some youngsters are using technology to help them get off.No, I’m not talking about rampant rabbits - consent apps are apparently the new thing among the younger generation to make sure they’re not raping each other.One of these apps, called uConsent, is “meant for communication about sex” creator Cody Swann claims.“This is like a digital handshake agreement” says Swann.Obviously anything that champions safety and awareness is a good thing – but with some apps suggesting that a couple takes a “state-of- mind test” to figure out who is drunk, and therefore unable to shag with consent, there’s a serious danger of creating something straight out of Black Mirror.What’s more, the apps – another is LegalFling - carry no legal weight in court cases so there’s a danger that these digital records arent as watertight as users may think.Not only does it denigrate the seriousness of rape (consent isn’t up for discussion with a rapist) but it completely undermines that vital spark in sexual relationships.What happens to romance when we trade the power of a wink or a glance for a QR code that’s been generated after you’ve ticked the Ts and Cs?We’re throwing away the most exciting part of human interaction, those few seconds where no one is sure what’s going to happen before someone goes in for the first kiss.As passion and spontaneity is yanked out from any potentially steamy moment, what might our favourite movie scenes if apps like uConsent were involved?It’s starting to rain.

There’s much more to come and it’s going to get even better.”But Labour women’s chair Jess Phillips said: “We have a problem getting trust in huge parts of the country outside our own echo chamber.”KEN Livingstone reignited the anti-Semitism row yesterday, claiming Zionists “collaborated” with Hitler, and insisting he will “go to his grave” saying so.He moaned on Sky News that coverage of his initial claims had been unfair.Labour suspended the ex-London Mayor, left, after his 2016 comments on an alleged Nazi deal.VINCE Cable claimed the Lib Dems were back after they won four councils in the best results for over a decade.The leader said the anti-Brexit party — written off a year ago — had “exceeded” expectations by taking seats from the Tories and Labour, and in Leave voting areas such as Hull and ­Sunderland.Overall the Lib Dems gained a net 66 seats across England, their best performance since gaining 123 in 2004.But experts warned that the party was benefiting from the fact it did so badly in 2014, the last time this year’s council election seats were contested.THE head of Ukip compared his party to the Black Death as he insisted they’d survive a council election wipeout.Despite losing 120 seats the anti-EU party will return, said general secretary Paul Oakley.He told the BBC: “It’s not all over at all. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages, it comes along, it causes disruption and then it goes dormant.“That’s exactly what we’re go­ing to do.”Reminded the Black Death killed tens of millions in the 14th century, Mr Oakley said it also led to economic growth.Ukip MEP Bill Etheridge said he’d quit politics next year, having lost his Dudley council seat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Studies have revealed that children who get more rest at night perform better at maths, science and reading. Sleeping is essential to a child’s development. Most children need at least nine hours’ sleep every night to be happy and healthy.Yet 400,000 kids in this country currently do not have a proper bed of their own to sleep in.They are forced to share with parents, sleep on sofas or even the floor. That’s why The Sun has teamed up with the charity Buttle UK’s Chances for Children campaign, and Dreams Beds, to help solve Britain’s growing bed crisis. Our Beds for Kids campaign will help to donate beds to those kids who do not have one.In this special four-page pullout, The Sun chats to a sleep expert about your child’s sleep needs, and we answer all your questions on battles over bedtime.WE all need sleep. It’s crucial to the quality of our lives and our wellbeing.While we rest, our body repairs itself and builds proteins and hormones essential for us to use during the day.But how much sleep we need and the pattern of that sleep varies from person to person and changes throughout our lives.YOUR beautiful new baby is asleep more than they are awake.For the first two years of a child’s life, their brain and body are growing at a rapid rate – more than it will ever grow in the rest of their lifetime.A newborn baby needs to eat and sleep – this is what keeps them alive.Most wake every few hours to eat – and 95 per cent cry with a night awakening that will need a parental response.Tots spend most of their time in light sleep, known as REM.Their twitching bodies and jerky eye movements are a clear sign of this stage.A newborn’s sleep cycle is 40 minutes long and they wake regularly.This is an evolutionary function so that your baby can be roused easily to eat or be alert to danger.hours of sleep are lost each night in first year of being a parent – 3,330 hours by time kids turn threeAS your baby becomes older, they will begin to regulate their body rhythms and their busy little minds are learning so much about the world.Sleep is essential to an infant’s healthy development. They need sleep to absorb language, form attachments and learn behavioural cues.By this age, their sleeping patterns have changed and most sleep is happening at night.Night waking occurs among 50 per cent of children who previously slept through the night.Most sleep problems in children are temporary and do not have long-lasting side effects.By nine months, a baby’s sleep cycle has matured and your infant is able to sleep for longer periods.AFTER their first birthday, toddlers sleep for 11 to 14 hours. Their sleep cycle is still just 40 minutes but now they can self-soothe and go back to sleep on their own.They can cope with less sleep. Instead of having lots of broken periods, one-year-olds enjoy longer runs of deep sleep during the night.But with more independence, sleep problems such as anxiety arise. Toddlers can start to wake more often in the night, aware they are alone in the dark in a big bed – and some will feel afraid.Parents need to respond carefully. Nap strikes can occur as toddlers assert themselves, but if they don’t get enough sleep they won’t produce enough sleep-inducing hormones and could become sleep-deprived.Helping a child calm down before bed is key. Offer carbs and warm milk to encourage a good night’s rest.of us are unhappy with the amount of sleep we get each nightMOST children at this age will need about 12 hours’ sleep.As a child gets older, more slow-wave, non-rapid eye-movement sleep occurs earlier in the night, with an increase of REM later.During the day, a preschooler’s brain is worked constantly as they learn.You may find their little bodies will become tired more quickly and your child could start asking to go to bed earlier.Try to keep to your normal bedtime routine. Sleep problems with anxiety can occur as a child becomes more aware of risk and the dangers around them.Preschoolers are very visual and three-year-olds can start to experience night terrors as they begin to be exposed to more television programmes or books, causing worry.Night terrors typically show in the first few hours of sleep.of us manage to get between seven and eight hours of shut-eye a nightAS your child grows up, they need less sleep. But with their busy social life, exam revision and increasing homework, plus a drama or football class after school, they must not skip sleep.School-age kids who do can be irritable and have difficulty with memory, attention and reasoning.Research also shows that kids who don’t have a regular bedtime are more likely to have problems with hyper-activity and bonding with peers.Children are on the go 24/7, never switching off their computers, endlessly checking phones, in touch with a world that never sleeps. This is having devastating effects on sleep and wellbeing.Kids should not watch TV or use computers before bed as the bright light emitted suppresses production of melatonin – the major sleep hormone.YOUR teen’s brain is undergoing huge change during sleep – and they still need more kip than an adult.The chemical imbalances and changes that occur during adolescence are equivalent to having schizophrenia.Teens are impulsive and sometimes unable to think rationally or make wise decisions as their brain develops.They are useless at getting up in the morning, often feeling lethargic.This is down to a shift in their body clock which means sleep-inducing hormone melatonin will not be released until around 11pm, continuing until 8am.So your teen finds it hard to switch off until the midnight hours, and even harder to wake in time for school. This is why some schools are considering later start times for teens, to tackle sleep deprivation and improve education.of kids are more likely to become obese if they fail to get at least eight hours a nightWITH 69 per cent of kids under the age of ten affected by sleep problems, getting enough rest is the key to keeping children happy.Sammy Margo, author of The Good Sleep Guide For Kids, gives her top tips for helping your child get a good night’s rest.THINK PINK: Colours have a strong influence on our mood and feelings. While blues and purples can be calming, they can also be cold.Pinks will soothe and calm, and greens are thought to have a balancing and harmonious effect. The ideal colours to send your child off to sleep peacefully are pale shades of pink and green.KEEP IT DARK: We sleep better without light. Where possible, prevent natural light from peeking around the blinds or curtains.Some children may be afraid of the dark so using a green or yellow night light and something that doesn’t shine in your child’s eyes can help.BANISH SCREENS: Studies show that children who watch TV or play with tablets in their rooms get less sleep, with some even rising earlier in the morning to watch TV at the expense of sleep.We know that exposure to blue light interferes with the release of your sleepy hormone melatonin, so this can impact on the quality and quantity of your child’s sleep.Try setting a technology cut-off time and ensure that you limit their screen time.WEAR WOOL: Although expensive, wool is ideal for bed covers. Its heat-regulating qualities will keep your child warm in cold weather and cool in the heat.Children sleep better in a cooler room, so aim for around 16-18C. This can help everyone to get a better night’s rest and sleep for longer.FOOD FOR THOUGHT: To help your child feel ready for sleep, give them a bedtime snack. Porridge contains small amounts of melatonin, the hormone that promotes sleep.Bananas contain melatonin and serotonin — another the sleep hormone — and muscle relaxant magnesium. Mash them with warm milk and a little honey for a super-sleep combination.EXERCISE IS KEY: Every child should have 60 active minutes of exercise a day. Divide the time into 15-minute slots throughout the day.Exercise in the daylight will help your child feel tired at bedtime and sleep well through the night. The combination of exercise and daylight works to regulate the body’s sleep/wake cycle.ROUTINE AT THE READY: A bedtime ritual can be hugely effective in making sure your child sleeps well every night.Children love rhythm and routine. Set aside time for a simple bedtime routine such as a warm, relaxing bath, followed by a bedtime story and a sleep-inducing glass of warm milk.Then dim the lights and watch as your child glides off into the Land of Nod.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OUR ten-year-old daughter just cannot sleep. She reads and reads, often until 11pm. We have tried asking her to switch off the light but she just wriggles around, making sure we are aware that she is still awake.She’s terrible in the mornings and we are sure she would be a happier person with more sleep but we have no idea how to make that happen. What should we do?A. As parents you are the best people to help your child learn to sleep independently. However, at times you may feel exhausted, stressed and worried about the amount of sleep your child may or may not be getting.Create a bedtime box that you make with your child. Put all the things she will need to feel safe at night into the box and do this every bedtime – maybe something soft to touch, pictures of you and safe books about sleep.Instruct her to go through these items at bedtime as a signpost toward sleep, helping to distract her from negative thoughts and feelings.The foundation of relaxing and habitualising her to her room and bed should be done by helping her feel that she is part of the process.Q. I HAVE just moved my 20-month-old toddler from a cot to a bed and he now ends up in my bed every night. What can I do to break this habit?A. Place different things under his pillow at night so he is excited about going to bed. Change the item on a daily basis.The idea is to create curiosity and surprise, encouraging a positive association with bedtime. Ground children in sight, sound, touch and smell, and use things they can see, hear, feel and smell to make them feel safe.Get your child used to his bed both day and night. The more time your child spends there, the more he will accept it. Do not leave him to cry unattended for a long period, as this will create a negative association, and try to not take him into your bed. Instead, lie next to him so he feels safe.Do this for each wake. It should take about two weeks to resolve.Q. MY daughter is 11 and struggles to get to sleep. She goes to bed at around 9pm and has to be up for school by 6.45am. But she becomes anxious about not being able to sleep.I tell her to read until she’s sleepy – or failing that, turn the lights out and listen to an audiobook. I don’t allow screens for an hour before bedtime, but other than that I’m clueless. How much sleep does she actually need?A. We hear a lot about getting your child into a good routine being essential for good sleep. But the interesting thing here is that routines are NOT the Holy Grail to sleep. Routine is just a small part of your sleep plan at night.Yes, a routine may be the only thing you need to do to help some babes sleep. But in my years of experience, it’s usually more than that.One key factor that most people miss is the environment. To get your child to sleep, you must ensure their bedroom is conducive to sleep. Would you sleep here? Help your child feel safe at night by ensuring their room isn’t too dark. Anxious children do not sleep. If it is too dark, then they will wake and call out for us. Also, do make sure they are not too cold or too hot.Most importantly, get her to write her worries in a worry book and place pictures of you around their room so she feels safe when you are not there.ASSESS: Analyse what’s happening, what you need to do and what your child’s needs are.UNDERSTAND: What is your child trying to communicate?SOOTH: Comfort your child appropriatelyEXIT: Leave the room and allow your child to sleep.Q. MY five-year-old wakes very early in the morning, about 5.30am, and it’s hard to convince him to go back to sleep. I can’t put him to bed later because he’s exhausted after school and begging to go to bed by 7pm. What can I do?A. Children are supposed to wake during the night and rise early but this is not ideal for us.Sleeping like a baby does not mean deep sleep. In fact, children are naturally light sleepers.They have more periods of light sleep than adults and these periods last longer.To combat early rising, you need to charm your child back to sleep. First think about your mental state. Are you calm and relaxed? A child can quickly pick up on your mood – if you are feeling stressed, so is your child.Focus on your breathing, by taking one breath at a time. This will slow your heart rate and relax any tension in your body. When you have focused on your breathing for two minutes, pick your child up, hold them close and breathe deeply in their ear steadily and rhythmically.The thought “my child will never sleep” is usually what most of my parents say crosses their mind – and when it does, it leads them to do all kinds of undesirable things, such as driving their child across town in order to allow sleep to happen, or rocking or feeding to sleep.These actions will not help your child to sleep independently. So by changing the way you think and having more helpful thoughts, you are more likely to act in a way that helps your child to sleep.Q. MY three-year-old daughter has just started having terrible nightmares. She wakes in the night and cries out for me and it takes her a very long time to calm down.What can I do to reassure her?A. Practise mindfulness. Sleep issues such as night terrors can make parents very anxious.At night, you want to be able to comfort your child in a way that means they are not dependent on you and also gets them back off to sleep.I use the “pause” method, which is popular in France and matches your response to the level of distress your child is in. It involves watching them for a few minutes to see if they go back to sleep, rather than rushing in and picking them up.GETTING your baby or tot to sleep, and stay asleep, is no easy feat.So here are some of the best aids to help exhausted parents . . .BEST FOR CUDDLING . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What is even more exciting is that we are able to normalise blood sugar levels and they can come off diabetes medications.Prof Bloom added that the injection mean doctors can vary the dose so that it could also be used by people who just want to control their diet.He branded the treatment a safe medication, as the hormones are mimicking our physiology.His research team is due to publish the findings in a medical journal soon."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000373159104.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"grenfell tower safety sheet pulled down cost wrong colour","story":"Campaigners want the plastic sheet to be green - arguing that the white colour will mean the building will be harder to see, and therefore be forgotten.Officials made the decision to cover the tower after it was warned the sight of the blackened building could be more traumatic for locals - but friends of survivors of the blaze told the Daily Mail the colour was wrong.One said: We wanted it to be a vivid colour so that this devastating tragedy would not be forgotten.But officials simply ignored us and started putting up a white one.The anniversary is coming up and this is already a traumatic time for those affected by the fire.Now we will have to commemorate the dead with the charred remains still dominating the skyline.

There are significant mysteries here, because while both Mars and the Earth were formed from the same stuff more than 4.5 billion years ago, they are now very different planets. NASA\u0027s scientists have seen a lot of evidence that Mars has quakes - known as marsquakes. Unlike Earth, where quakes are caused by tectonic plates, Mars has very quiet tectonic processes.This means marsquakes are more likely to be caused by other forms of tectonic activity, including volcanism and cracks forming in the planet\u0027s crust.NASA said: \"Each marsquake would be like a flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet\u0027s interior.Earth and Venus have tectonic systems which have destroyed most evidence of their early history, but Mars (which is just one third the size of those planets), contains less energy to power these tectonic processes.NASA said this makes Mars a fossil planet in many ways because it has remained static for more than three billion years.The mission launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Usually, missions to other planets launch from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida and fly east, over the water of the Atlantic Ocean."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/3Gduepif0T1UGY8H4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4301108.jpg?20180505081907 ","title":"royal wedding meghan markles family woes make the whole thing a bit more relatable","story":"It has led to suggestions her dad wouldn\u0027t be at the wedding, that they aren\u0027t close, and he wouldn\u0027t walk her down the aisle, but the couple have squashed those rumours by announcing that both Thomas and Doria will have important roles on the big day.There is of course the often slightly awkward \"meeting of the in laws\" moment especially if divorced parents are involved.I think most of us can sympathise with that cue artificial small talk or general banter about what your daughter was like as a baby. But this transatlantic relationship has meant that for Harry and Meghan that meeting has been delayed for longer than you\u0027d normally expect, with the Markles and the Windsors only getting together for the first time in the week running up to the wedding.The mud-slinging from Meghan\u0027s half siblings must have been another difficult thing for her to deal with, and another sign that it isn\u0027t all happy families.An open letter from her half brother Thomas Junior suggesting Harry should walk away from the wedding was astonishing.But again it\u0027s been a reminder that actually this Royal romance has had its hurdles."}]
