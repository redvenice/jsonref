TfL notes the pandemic has \u0027devastated\u0027 its accounts, with fares revenue falling by 95 per cent at the height of the first coronavirus wave in 2020.It has been forced to dip into its cash reserves to keep services running while going cap in hand to the government for support.Mr Johnson\u0027s administration has already pledged £4billion in subsidies to keep the system running, as well as £600 million in loans.The financial crisis has also affected the capital\u0027s new east-west Crossrail route, formally known as the Elizabeth Line, with the stretched budget adding to delays and costs.Other global cities have faced similar struggles, including Ile-de-France Mobilites (IDFM) in the Paris area, which needed government support in its 2020 and 2021 budgets.Meanwhile in the United States, \u0027strong\u0027 financial support packages passed by Congress and the White House helped replace ticket revenues lost from lockdowns, according to Paul Skoutelas, head of the American Public Transportation Association, an industry organisation. But TfL, which gets nearly two-thirds of its operating income from fares - a much higher proportion compared to New York or Paris, where it is more like 40 per cent - has been left especially exposed.\u0027Pre-Covid, TfL was largely self-sustained,\u0027 explained Taku Fujiyama, who leads University College London\u0027s railway research group, noting it received no major central government grants.\u0027Some cost-cutting measures are on the table now,\u0027 he said, adding dramatic line closures were unlikely but minor service changes \u0027might happen\u0027.\u0027TfL needs to play a delicate game,\u0027 Mr Fujiyama told AFP. \u0027The central government would not give blank cheques, and the TfL would need to demonstrate their effort, whilst the mayor knows that dramatic service reduction would be politically costly.\u0027With the threat from the Omicron variant now receding, passengers are returning to the system, aiding revenues but still leaving a large gap to plug.Weekday passenger numbers were at 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels on the Tube and 70 per cent on buses in mid-January, with TfL expecting them both to reach 80 per cent this year.The organisation has said it is exploring a number of ways to boost income, including through efficiency gains, commercial property projects and consultancy services. Keith Prince, Greater London Authority Conservative Transport spokesman, told MailOnline today: \u0027This Mayor says he is passionate about tackling climate change and yet he cancels his own green strategies. It seems he is more focused on the press release than the practical application.\u0027He should be focusing on restoring the Night Tube. It\u0027s a vital service for everyone, especially women and vulnerable Londoners needing a safe route home, alongside London\u0027s key workers, who often travel to and from work at unsociable times.\u0027He has been promising an upgrade of Gallows Corner since 2016, we\u0027re still waiting. The junction remains incredibly dangerous with numerous safety concerns, the flyover was only designed to be temporary and recently celebrated its 50th birthday.\u0027As with many new policies, they only work when you take people along with you. He has expanded the ULEZ whilst stopping funding for the scrappage schemes and has not offered any amnesty for those who need it most. Imposing change when people have not been part of the journey can have a devastating and counterproductive impact.\u0027And Tony Devenish, GLA Conservative environment spokesman, told MailOnline today: \u0027The Mayor is incredibly inconsistent. On the one hand he announces green strategies and halts existing schemes with the other. His left hand doesn\u0027t know what his right hand is doing. TfL is ultimately the Mayor of London\u0027s responsibility.\u0027It\u0027s already had a £4billion bailout and more will likely follow next month. He should not hold Londoners hostage as a negotiation tactic. We\u0027re still waiting for the two million trees Sadiq promised.\u0027It\u0027s been suggested that trees can help prevent flash flooding, such as the terrible London flooding we experienced last year. The Mayor needs to focus on policies that provide green solutions to environmental problems, especially when they also deliver on his broken promises.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Tens thousands troops ordered spend DAY reflecting inclusivity","story":"Share this articleTroops ordered to spend day \u0027reflecting on inclusivity\u0027, despite crisis at Ukraine border"},{"url":null,"title":"RAF Typhoon jets scramble intercept unidentified aircraft","story":"Share this article   Senior State Department officials described the call as professional and \u0027fairly candid,\u0027 noting that if Russia wanted to prove it isn\u0027t going to invade Ukraine, it should withdraw its troops from the border and neighboring Belarus.Shortly after speaking to Lavrov, Blinken convened a conference call with the secretary general of NATO, the EU foreign policy chief and the chairman-in-office of the OSCE as part of efforts to ensure that the allies are engaged in any further contacts with Russia.Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Russia\u0027s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the U.S. statement about its readiness for dialogue \u0027doesn\u0027t correlate\u0027 with Washington sending planeloads of military equipment to Ukraine.\u0027I don\u0027t know why the U.S. is escalating tensions and at the same time accusing Russia,\u0027 he said. "},{"url":null,"title":"Ex Lloyds Banking boss Sir Antonio Horta Osorio Knight Bachelor ceremony","story":"Share this articleLloyds boss: Mental health issues can break lives - BBC NewsAntónio Horta-Osório: The banker who can\u0027t stay out of the headlines - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Water firm tells bathers visiting Bournemouth beach swim mouths shut avoid SEWAGE","story":"Share this article A spokesman for Wessex Water said Ms Barden was \u0027reiterating\u0027 guidance from Public Health England.He said: \u0027Advice from both Public Health England and wild swimming groups is to avoid ingesting river, lake or sea water while swimming as there will always be bacteria in the sea - from wildlife faeces and run-off from agricultural land, as well as regulated storm overflows and treated sewage discharges.\u0027Ruth Barden was reiterating that advice and emphasising that the only water guaranteed to be free from bacteria is tap water.

Video: Reuters Oireachtas TVNorthern Ireland’s Minister for Agriculture Edwin Poots: ‘The advice concluded that I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval.’ Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe North’s Minister for Agriculture has ordered that post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland’s ports are to be halted from midnight tonight. The Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that such a move by Mr Poots would be “a breach of international law”. “The protocol is part of an international agreement,” Mr Coveney told the Seanad on Wednesday evening. “It was agreed and ratified by the EU and the UK and its implementation is not only is it part of an international treaty, it’s part of international law.”“To deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty would be a very serious matter indeed,” he said. “It would be essentially playing politics with legal obligations.”He said that the protocol was “designed and conceived to protect the Good Friday Agreement” and that it “fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland”. He urged that the negotiations between the UK and the EU on the protocol should be allowed to continue.“International law matters,” he said. However, making the announcement to reporters at Stormont, the Mr Poots said “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval. “The advice concluded that I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval. “I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on December 31st 2020 from midnight tonight. “I will prepare a paper for Executive consideration in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward,” he said. The DUP and other unionist parties are opposed to the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement which avoided a hard Border on the island of Ireland by creating a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. They claim it is creating economic hardship and has undermined the North’s constitutional position as an integral part of the UK by placing a barrier between it and Britain. StuntSince the UK left the EU physical checks have been required for some agri-food shipments from Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Poots sought legal advice from senior counsel after he attempted to bring a paper to the Northern Executive last week to seek a vote on the checks. It is party’s broader campaign against the protocol, which has led it to repeatedly threatened to withdraw its ministers from the Stormont Executive – potentially leading to the collapse of the power-sharing institutions – if sufficient changes are not made to the protocol. Mr Poots claimed recent court rulings mean the Executive must give its approval for the checks to continue, but last week’s move was criticised as a stunt by other parties, who maintain the Executive has already agreed his department is responsible for carrying out the checks and he does not have the authority to halt them as they are a requirement of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international agreement. Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd said the Northern Ireland protocol was the law and Mr Poots and all Executive ministers were required to follow the law.“The DUP signed off at the Executive that they would adhere to the regulations within the protocol,” he said. “I have a number of questions which require to be answered by Mr Poots. Where did he get this legal advice? “Did he go to the Attorney General? Did he use government legal advisers? “The facts remain the same. The Executive has a position that they will adhere to the protocol, to the European Withdrawal Agreement, and the principle remains for all Executive ministers, you have to adhere to the law,” he said. Mr O’Dowd said he had “no doubt” civil servants were “already taking advice on these matters. “The civil service has its own guidance and protocols to work to and I have no doubt the civil service will be examining that very closely,” he said. The Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said on social media that people were “tired of this grandstanding and instability” over the protocol and Mr Poots had “received clear legal advice in March 2020 when he first tried this stunt.” “The Executive was clear”, she said, as was the UK’s Department of Agriculture, that the department in Northern Ireland is “obliged by law to undertake these checks”.The  has asked the department if its officials will comply with Mr Poots’ order to halt the checks.

File photograph:  Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said he has not ruled out the possibility of a statutory inquiry for the Women of Honour group, who have highlighted allegations of assaults and sexual harassment within the Defence Forces. Mr Martin briefed the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on Wednesday about his meeting with the group and said he wanted a judge-led scoping inquiry to get underway as quickly as possible. The group walked out of a meeting with Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Simon Coveney last week after not receiving an undertaking there would be a statutory inquiry. The Taoiseach also told Fianna Fáil colleagues the Government will look to extend its measures to address the rising cost of living to students and parents facing hardship in the education sector. Micheál Martin that he was acutely aware of the costs of education. According to party colleagues who attended the meeting in Leinster House, he said he was examining measures to assist students and parents.“On third-level funding we acknowledge the need to provide a core level of funding that supports colleges and universities and the need to address the demographic pressures that are there,” he told his party’s TDs and Senators. It comes on the back of measures agreed at the highest level of Government to deal with the impact of the sharp increase in inflation during 2021 and early 2022, especially in the energy sector. Mr Martin told the meeting he was committed to ensure that the spending power of people was protected. “We are conscious of the impact of the cost of living and how much of it is energy related,” he said. “It is important to protect the disposable income of workers and families.”He said the Government was now looking at a range of measures to enable people to cope with the cost of living increases and to protect people’s disposable incomes during a difficult time.Rationale Minister for Education Norma Foley also outlined her rationale for choosing a written Leaving Certificate examination in 2022. There was little resistance expressed to the decision. “There was some relief among us that the Leaving Cert changes have been well received by the vast majority of students. It is felt the issue has been put to bed,” one TD said. He also told the meeting that the Government would announce a major retrofitting scheme next week which would address the need to make it affordable. He acknowledged there were issues with retrofitting at present, particularly the up-front costs. Mr Martin said concerns related to orthopaedic waiting times for children are concerning, especially in the light of new disclosures which showed that children with spina bifida were waiting up to four years for surgery. “We have provided funding to give capacity to the health system to provide treatment and children cannot be waiting such an inordinate length of time. The system must deliver on the resources they have been provided,” he said. Mr Martin also claimed colleagues that Sinn Féin was hardening its strategy to attack the government. “We can’t allow their parliamentary and political tactics that seek to delay progress on many key issues. We in Fianna Fáil are in a government of action that wants to get things done,” he said.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA Dutch hospital has confirmed that a gynaecologist used his own sperm in fertility treatment to father at least 21 children and perhaps “dozens more” – in the third case of its kind in the Netherlands since the 1970s.The latest scandal came to light when an organisation that helps people to trace their biological parents found DNA matches between children whose mothers had all received fertility treatment at the Elisabeth Hospital in Liederdorp, near Leiden, since absorbed into the Alrijne Hospital.Further investigation revealed last summer that the DNA involved also matched the DNA of one of the treating gynaecologist’s own children. The doctor has been named as Jos Beek, who died in 2019 after working at the hospital for 25 years from 1973 to 1998. The 21 children whose identity has been established are known to have been conceived between 1973 and 1986. “We were very shocked when we saw the evidence of what had happened,” said Peter Jue, a spokesman for the hospital’s board of management. “We were shocked for the children directly affected and, of course, shocked for their parents too.“The way this doctor behaved was totally unacceptable. The women involved believed they were being fertilised using sperm from anonymous donors.“We don’t exclude the possibility that dozens more children fathered by Jos Beek may yet be discovered – and so we are asking everyone who has been treated by this gynaecologist to come forward and talk to us.”Records destroyedIn fact, the hospital has been forced to go public and issue an appeal for the mothers treated by Dr Beek to contact a special helpline because its own internal records have since been destroyed.It also revealed that it launched an independent investigation last January by retired gynaecologist Didi Braat, emeritus professor of reproductive medicine at Radboud University Medical Centre. She is expected to report by summer.Since 2004, children in the Netherlands have had the right to know the identities of their biological parents once they reach the age of 16.Dutch law also limits the number of children who may be fathered by any single sperm donor to 21.“In the early 1970s, fertility treatment was still in its infancy,” said Mr Jue. “The field was still developing. There was very little regulation in the sector compared to today. Now we have national protocols and regular clinical audits.”Beek is the third Dutch fertility doctor known to have used his own sperm in fertility treatment. In 2019, it emerged that Jan Karbaat, from Rotterdam, had fathered at least 40 children during the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. In October 2020, it emerged that Dr Jan Wildschut had used his own sperm to father 17 children.

Its great policy relaunch is a tragic mush, proof that it no longer really believes in anything, not even its own self-preservation. Conservative supporters, keen to move on from Partygate, were desperate for a comprehensive package of conservative ideas to enrich the North, relaunch Brexit and pave the way for an electoral resurgence. It was not to be.Michael Gove’s levelling-up blueprint is a grotesque disappointment, a list of buzzwords and targets masquerading as strategy, its pseudo-intellectual veneer and cod history intended to camouflage the fact that it essentially advocates the very same nostrums that ultimately destroyed Labour.A proper conservative approach to levelling-up would focus on schooling, and the heart-breaking results of the white working class. It would investigate family policy and the values crisis. It would create dozens of libertarian pro-business areas, run by development corporations, with almost no taxes and regulation. It would target cheaper energy. It would liberate an extra one per cent of Britain’s landmass for house building. It would tackle the failed monolith that is the NHS. It would not see spending on public transport as a panacea. It would reject targets, subsidies and bureaucracies. It would break with socialism.Instead, Torsten Bell of the Left-wing Resolution Foundation, Britain’s most influential economics think-tank despite our nominally Tory administration, describes Johnsonian levelling up as a fusion between George Osborne and New Labour. “The agenda combines the devolution of the former Conservative Chancellor with the last Labour government’s biggeractivist central state reprioritising spend towards deprived areas”, as he puts it.A central problem is that too many Tories now have a vested interest in pretending that the form of devolution practiced in this country has been a success. This is the very reverse of the truth.Competition between local jurisdictions works, but only if set up correctly. Britain’s flawed model encourages bailouts from Westminster, grants power without fiscal responsibility and encourages municipal socialism. It doesn’t incentivise local leaders to improve competitiveness, or to think carefully enough about spending projects.Eurosceptics were always opposed to Labour’s flawed devolution: The North East Says No campaign, which defeated John Prescott’s devolution drive in 2004, was a dry run for the Brexit referendum, and included figures who went on to work for Vote Leave.The Tories also have not answered a fundamental contradiction: why do they want to make everywhere like London, given that our capital voted Corbyn and Remain? Left to its own devices, London would self-destruct, imposing punitive taxes and chasing away its value-creators. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is at it again, threatening to shut roads and tube services if he isn’t bailed out. We need more Canary Wharfs, created before devolution, and fewer City Halls.In the US, the Republicans don’t want to turn the whole of America into New York or San Francisco – they look instead at Texas or Florida. We need to replicate the brilliant bits of London, its ability to create jobs and wealth, without the socialism and cultural Left-wingery. If the Tories really believed in local accountability, they would break London up into several competing entities, not create yet more dysfunctional, statist, subsidy-hungry, rotten boroughs all over the country.If the establishment technocrats are getting everything they want, the Right has been left with almost nothing, including on Brexit. The scale of the betrayal is staggering. The Brexit white paper is one of the most shameful economic policy documents ever produced by a Conservative government. Margaret Thatcher’s Bruges Speech, Christopher Booker’s Mad Officials, Brian Hindley’s Better Off Out, the Open Europe deregulatory reports, Business for Britain’s Change or Go: all targeted over-regulation. Yet that powerful intellectual movement, built over decades, has virtually zero presence in the Remainers’ Brexit being delivered by Johnson.There have, of course, been major changes on immigration and foreign policy, and the vaccination success would not, in practice, have happened had we been part of the EU. That alone means that it was worth it, though the agricultural reforms are flawed. The decision to allow Hong Kongers to settle would also have been politically impossible had EU free movement still existed.But when it comes to the economy, the Government’s policy barely differs from Theresa May’s Brexit in name only. The authors of the 2016 Treasury attacks on Brexit have triumphed: they argued that there was very little in Britain’s tax, spend and regulatory structure that needed to be changed, and, staggeringly, Johnson’s government now agrees.All of which brings us to energy policy, another case study in extreme failure. A sensible government would urgently accelerate its nuclear plans by creating a powerful agency modelled on the vaccines taskforce. As a temporary solution, such an administration would also push to extract more oil and gas, including by fracking.Instead, a government that no longer believes in markets will now simply pretend that prices are much lower than they are. The Treasury will lend billions to energy companies to allow them to moderate price rises customers will then pay higher bills in the future to ensure the Treasury (hopefully) recoups its money.The furlough and bailouts that accompanied Covid – necessary evils given state-mandated lockdowns – have perverted our politics, undermining self-reliance and normalising handouts.That wail you hear is the cry of Toryland: among the true believers, the long-marchers, the Eurosceptics and the free-marketeers, there is sorrow, anger and despair.

Julia Lo Bue-Said, the chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership, which represents independent travel agents, said: How can we be treated differently if we base it purely on vaccination status? Why are travellers from the UK being treated differently?Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, said: Some countries are penalising British citizens because of Brexit. British consumers are losing their freedom of movement.People are so confused now about the restrictions in place to get to certain European countries that they are almost giving up on some destinations in Europe and choosing to go to other places. It will be Europe\u0027s loss if they continue to put such barriers in place.It is not only southern European countries that have adopted such an approach.

It is the first time a university cancel culture row will be heard in court.The row has seen fellows at Cambridge pitted against academics from Oxford University. Prof Lawrence Goldman, a Jesus alumnus and an Emeritus Fellow in History St Peter\u0027s College, Oxford, opposed Jesus\u0027s application. Opponents have called Prof Nigel Biggar, a Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at Oxford, as a witness.For opponents, attempting to remove the memorial represents an oversimplification of history and denies students the chance to think for themselves.But the college has taken the view that it represents a celebration of Mr Rustat which is incompatible with the chapel as an inclusive community and a place of collective wellbeing.Rustat (1608-1694) was a courtier to Charles II and an investor in the Royal African Company (RAC) and the Company of Royal Adventurers, both slaving enterprises.He commissioned the memorial himself when he was already a significant benefactor to the college.Supporters of retaining the monument, including Dr Goldman, have argued that the totality of his life should be considered, not just his investments in slavery. Among his many other donations was a contribution to the reconstruction of St Paul\u0027s cathedral.Reverend James Crockford, the chapel\u0027s dean, who is responsible for the historic building, believes the memorial is a barrier to (students\u0027) participation in the chapel, the hearing was told.He told the court that there were students who did not attend the chapel because they “find it distressing to enter” and others who attended but “feel disquieted and discomfited by the presence of the memorial”.Being questioned, he was asked Do you think that church should always be a safe space? and he gave an adamant yes.But Justin Gau, the lawyer representing opponents to the memorial\u0027s removal, said: We shouldn\u0027t remove the difficulties life throws at us in a chapel, should we?.Mr Gau also suggested that adding context to the memorial to Rustat would be enough to stop it being distressing to students.For some unchurched undergraduates, he said, seeing images of Jesus a crucified man, a dead man who had been tortured might also be disturbing, if they didn\u0027t have the well-known context of Christianity.Mr Gau even raised the role of slavery in the Bible saying Where, for example, in the gospels is slavery condemned?St Paul returned a slave to his master, he said and asking: What was he doing there?Reverend Crockford, said it happened when St Paul expected the end of the world imminently.Were the memorial not to be moved, Reverend Crockford said, some of these students would be a “lot less ready to participate in the life of the chapel” and that it “would do untold damage to reputation of chapel within college” and its role in non-religious events.Historic England has warned that its removal would harm the significance of Jesus College Chapel.In 1671, Rustat donated £2,000 (approx £450,000 in today\u0027s money) to Jesus College for the education of the orphan sons of Anglican clergy.His investment in the Royal African Company is believed to have been £400. He is better known, however, for serving Charles II loyally for eighteen years, including in exile in Europe and during the English Civil War.The decision to attempt have the plaque removed came after the college set up a Legacy of Slavery Working Party (LSWP) to pursue critical self-reflection on the long-term legacies of slavery and colonial violence.The group of eight academics and two students recommended that the memorial be contextualised and its history acknowledged.The LSWP was also behind the return in 2021 of a large bronze cockerel looted from Benin City in the 19th Century.As the chapel comes under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Ely, the college has had to petition a consistory court for permission to remove the plaque.The hearing is taking place in the chapel itself, with representatives and witnesses regularly gesturing towards and turning around in their seats to look at the memorial.The college wants to place it on permanent display elsewhere in the college alongside “contextualising” material.Alumni have also written in support of the college\u0027s application, including witness Amatey Doku - a former Cambridge Union president who was part of a group that led a five-year campaign to hand back Jesus College’s Okukor Bronze, one of the Benin Bronzes.Mr Mark Hill QC, representing the college, told the court that “This is nothing to do with erasing, cancelling or in some way nullifying the existence and the name of Tobias Rustat”.The Right Reverend Stephen Conway, the Bishop of Ely, told the hearing that the memorial needed to be removed so that current students were not reminded of the ways in which their forebears were tortured and dehumanised.Mr Gou and Mr Goldman, who is also representing the petitioners opposed, both questioned witnesses as to why the memorial could not be contextualised in situ.Sonita Alleyne, the master of Jesus College and the first black master of any Oxbridge college, told the hearing that adding context “wouldn’t take the memorial out of a position of veneration”.Mr Gau said Mr Rustat was a generous benefactor of the college and that, despite his very small involvement in the slave trade, there was now a black female master of the college.Ms Alleyne replied: How much sin do you need to have before you come off the wall?Defenders of Rustat have previously insisted that only a small fraction of his wealth ever came from slavery and that he was not directly or actively involved in it.Speaking in the hearing, Mr Gau said that students had made incorrect statements about Rustat’s involvement.Mr Gau referred to a phrase often repeated in students\u0027 emails: It\u0027s totally wrong for the statue of someone who was so heavily involved in the horrific crimes of slavery to be glorified in the heart of our community.And he said one email saying Mr Rustat made his money from slavery and caused immeasurable human suffering was incorrect.Rev Crockford replied: It\u0027s my understanding that he did make some of his money from slavery.A student\u0027s email dated December 19 2020 said Mr Rustat amassed much of his wealth from the RAC, which Mr Gau said is simply not true.Another email from an undergraduate expressed strong support for the removal of the memorial, and claimed Mr Rustat has been clearly demonstrated as a very active slave trader.Mr Gau said there was no demonstration in any document that Tobias Rustat was any sort of slave trader.Rev Crockford said: Not perhaps in the narrow definition of the word.The hearing will continue on Thursday.More from NewsRevolt against Boris Johnson grows as three more no confidence letters go inBoris’s betrayal of his revolutionary Brexit mandate is now almost total‘Deep hatred’ for autistic boy, nine, drove man to kill him and his motherFewer than one in six victims report rape as they fear police will not ‘do anything about it’Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s lawyers claim \u0026#39lying juror\u0026#39 violated her right to fair trialBritish Airways flying low as airline ranked second-worst for short-haul flightsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"plaid cymru demands end quirky names farm called hakuna matata","story":"Plaid Cymru has demanded an end to “quirky” non-traditional names after a farm named “Hakuna Matata” replaced the original Welsh title on an Ordnance Survey map.Sara Davies bought a plot of empty land, originally named Banc Cornicyll, near Gorslas, Carmarthenshire, in 1997.She built a house on the land and named the property with the Swahili phrase, which means “there are no troubles” and is used in the Disney film The Lion King.Now it has emerged that this change means the original name no longer appears anywhere on the Ordnance Survey map.Speaking to Wales Online, Mrs Davies said that the name, Banc Cornicyll, had disappeared before they had purchased the land in 1997, although it is listed on documents recording the sale still on the land registry.She added: We went to the Post Office, and said we were a new-build house.They said there was no registered address for the land so we could choose to call it whatever we liked.Obviously Lion King was popular at the time, some of my husband’s friends had been working in South Africa and knew that ‘hakuna matata’ wasn’t just a Disney term but genuine Swahili and therefore it had a meaning to it.”Despite Mrs Davies saying she would never have changed the name if she knew there was a historic alternative, Plaid Cymru warned that there was a growing “trend of anglicising names”.Plaid Cymru’s rural affairs and housing spokesperson, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said: “Wales has its own language and culture. This is no clearer imprint of this than in the unique place names of many homes, farms and places across the country.“As part of safeguarding the language, there must be an end to this trend of anglicising names, and the false belief that having quirky or anglicised names makes somewhere more palatable for others.“Our place names, be they houses or fields, tells a story, a story that is unique to this corner of the world. That rich heritage is a treasure that must be valued and protected.“There must be mechanisms in place, whether that’s through planning or legislation, to help protect the language, and to reflect the valuable history of locations in Wales.”Solicitor Simon Chandler, who helped create a scheme called Diogelwn, which aims to protect Welsh names, said a lot of people simply don’t understand the importance of place names.He added: “It is important because a house name or a place name is like a time capsule.“It tells us something about the history of the land and every time we lose one of those we lose a connection with the land and the past.“A lot of people who buy houses don\u0027t necessarily understand the significance of the name.”Mr Chandler’s scheme wants those who intend to sell property to include a clause in the contract which would block buyers from changing the name.More from NewsRevolt against Boris Johnson grows as three more no confidence letters go inBoris’s betrayal of his revolutionary Brexit mandate is now almost total‘Deep hatred’ for autistic boy, nine, drove man to kill him and his motherFewer than one in six victims report rape as they fear police will not ‘do anything about it’Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s lawyers claim \u0026#39lying juror\u0026#39 violated her right to fair trialChapels should be a ‘safe space’, says Cambridge college dean as slavery row gets its day in courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trusting people do right thing saved lives covid lockdowns","story":"Lockdowns prevented just 0.2 per cent of deaths in comparison with just trusting people to do the right thing, a new study has suggested.Researchers from Johns Hopkins University in the US, Lund University in Sweden and the Centre for Political Studies in Denmark said that the costs to society far outweighed the benefits and called for lockdown to be “rejected out of hand” as a future pandemic policy.The team even found that some lockdown measures may have increased deaths by stopping access to outdoor space, “pushing people to meet at less safe places” while isolating infected people indoors where they could pass on the virus to family members and housemates.“We do find some evidence that limiting gatherings was counterproductive and increased Covid-19 mortality,” the authors concluded.“Often, lockdowns have limited people’s access to safe outdoor places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe indoor places.”To calculate the benefits of lockdown, the researchers looked at 24 academic papers estimating their effectiveness as well as other interventions such as wearing masks, business and school closures, border closures and stay-at-home orders.They found that some measures did save lives. Closing non-essential businesses was estimated to have lowered mortality by about 10.6 per cent, a fall largely driven by closing drinking establishments.Shutting schools probably also lowered deaths by 4.4 per cent, while asking people to stay at home prevented 2.9 per cent of deaths, and border controls roughly 0.1 per cent.However, they found legally enforced lockdowns were only a tiny bit better at cutting deaths than allowing the public to follow recommendations such as working from home and limiting social contact, as happened in countries such as Sweden.The first lockdown prevented just 0.2 per cent of deaths, they concluded – which for Britain in the first wave would mean it saved about 100 lives out of 52,000 – when compared to letting people take precautions themselves.Jonas Herby, a special adviser at the Centre for Political Studies and one of the study’s authors, told The : “When we look at lockdown, we don’t find much of an effect. We think that most people don’t want to get sick or infect their neighbours, so if you just give people the proper knowledge they do the right thing to take care of themselves, and others, and so that’s why lockdowns don’t work.“In general, we should trust that people can make the right decisions, so the key thing is to educate them and tell them when the infection rates are high and when it’s dangerous to go out and how to protect yourself.“One possible reason that lockdowns seem ineffective is that some measures are counterproductive. There is some evidence that putting limits on gatherings actually increased the number of deaths.”The authors criticised the original Imperial College London model which suggested that Britain could see 500,000 deaths without a lockdown, saying it did not take into account the real-world behaviour of people during a pandemic.Researchers said it was clear that the public would naturally socially distance and cut their contacts even without state intervention, leading to a large drop in deaths. Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins and another of the study’s authors, said: “Lockdowns in Europe and the US decreased Covid-19 mortality by a measly 0.2 per cent on average, while the economic costs of lockdowns were enormous. I find zero evidence to support lockdowns.”One of the studies cited in the review found that voluntary behavioural changes are 10 times as important as mandatory behavioural changes in combating Covid-19.They also found that lockdowns only regulate “a fraction of our potential contagious contacts” and cannot enforce hand washing, coughing etiquette or how close people stand together in supermarkets.Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway, which all kept mortality relatively low, allowed people to go to work, use public transport and meet privately at home during the first lockdown, the authors said.They concluded: “Lockdowns during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic have had devastating effects. They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence and undermining liberal democracy.“These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best. Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion: lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.”Since January 2021, Boris Johnson has resisted calls for further lockdowns despite calls from experts, yet the NHS has not been overwhelmed.Critics of the study claimed that the authors have conflicting interests, particularly Prof Hanke who has been an outspoken critic of restrictions that damage the economy.He also signed the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for the shielding of the most vulnerable while allowing the virus to spread through society, allowing the build-up of natural immunity.Many scientists believe that lockdowns were essential before vaccines and antiviral drugs were available with one study suggesting the first lockdown saved 20,000 lives in Britain.Imperial College London also estimated that lockdowns saved about 3.1 million lives in Europe, including 470,000 in Britain.More from NewsRevolt against Boris Johnson grows as three more no confidence letters go inBoris’s betrayal of his revolutionary Brexit mandate is now almost total‘Deep hatred’ for autistic boy, nine, drove man to kill him and his motherFewer than one in six victims report rape as they fear police will not ‘do anything about it’Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s lawyers claim \u0026#39lying juror\u0026#39 violated her right to fair trialChapels should be a ‘safe space’, says Cambridge college dean as slavery row gets its day in courtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"16 parties investigated sue gray","story":"All  Downing Street and Whitehall parties being investigated by Met PoliceSenior civil servant Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the Downing Street lockdown parties, including a bash allegedly held in Boris Johnsons own flatthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-responds-sue-gray-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:lqCgVPM,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Whitehall enforcer published a short update on her partygate probe, which was heavily watered down due to an ongoing police investigation. Ms Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the lockdown parties that should not have been allowed. Scotland Yard has been been handed  pictures and  pieces of paper for its inquiry, which could see Boris Johnson and his we Carrie quizzed by police. The PM may have attended as many as six events that are being looked into by police, including an event in his own Downing Street flat.  Here are the  events investigated by Ms Gray, including the  being probed by police :  May : a photograph showing a number of groups in the garden of No Downing Street  May : a gathering in the garden of No  Downing Street for No  staff*  June : a gathering in the Cabinet Office,  Whitehall on the departure of a No  private secretary*  June : a gathering in the Cabinet room in No  Downing Street on the Prime Minister’s birthday*  November : a gathering in the No  Downing Street flat*  November : and a gathering in No  Downing Street on the departure of a special adviser*  November : a gathering in No  Downing Street on the departure of a special adviser  December : a gathering in the Department for Education ahead of the Christmas break  December : a gathering in No  Downing Street for an online Christmas quiz  December : a gathering in Cabinet Office,  Whitehall to hold an online Christmas quiz for the Cabinet Secretary’s private office*  December : a gathering in Cabinet Office,  Whitehall on the departure of a senior Cabinet Office official*  December : a gathering in No  Downing Street on the departure of a No  official*  December : a gathering in No  Downing Street ahead of the Christmas break*  January : a gathering in No  Downing Street on the departure of two No  private secretaries*  April : A gathering in No  Downing Street on the departure of a senior No  official*  April : A gathering in No  Downing Street on the departure of another No  official.*  Only four events do not meet Scotland Yardaposs threshold for investigation, including a gathering in the Downing Street garden on May   where the PM and staff were pictured enjoying cheese and wine. A leaving do on November   for special adviser Cleo Watson, a Christmas drinks at the Department for Education on  December  and a No Christmas quiz on  December  will also be left out of the police inquiry. Ms Gray unearthed several new gatherings including a leaving do in the Cabinet Office on June , , another No  farewell bash on December ,  - on top of two already reported - and a prosecco-fuelled leaving do on January , . Gatherings at the Treasury on November ,  and drinks at the Department for Transport on December ,  were not included.More than  parties have been uncovered across Downing Street, Whitehall and Tory HQ during lockdown rules since the Mirror first revealed that lockdown-flouting parties had taken place. Mr Johnson is believed to have attended as many as six of the gatherings police are looking at. These include reports of a party in the flat he shares with his we Carrie on November   - the night Dominic Cummings resigned. The Mirror reported that aides “drank their socks off and staff reported hearing loud music pumping out of the flat late into the night. Downing Street and the PM have explicitly denied this event took place - but several reports have emerged that Abbaaposs The Winner Takes it Allapos was blasted so loud it could be heard in nearby St Jamesapos Park.  A separate leaving do for Mr Johnsonaposs spin doctor Lee Cain on the same night is being examined by cops. Scotland Yard are also examining a birthday gathering on  June  in the Cabinet room, where Mrs Johnson is said to have led staff in a chorus of Happy Birthday. A BYOB bash in the Downing Street garden on May  , which the Prime Minister has admitted to attending briefly, is also in their sights. Police are also looking at a Cabinet Office leaving do on June  , said to be for former home affairs policy adviser Hannah Young, who left Downing Street to take up the role of deputy consul general in New York. Police are also considering three events on December  - a Christmas quiz in Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, a send off for Kate Josephs, the former Director General of the Covid Taskforce, and another gathering for the departure of a No  official which has never been reported. The Downing Street Christmas bash on December , first revealed by the Mirror, is being probed. A new allegation about a leaving do for two No  private secretary on January   is being considered. And two boozy Downing Street leaving drinks on the eve on the Prince Philipaposs funeral in April  are being probed.

The CPS said he had no involvement in the decision. Meanwhile, he claimed it was wrong for the PM to insist the Tories are the party of low taxes at a time when heaposs squeezing working people to the pips. Things were so tense, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle had to warn MPs not to accuse the PM of lying, which is unparliamentary.In his replies to Sir Keir, Boris Johnson earned roars of support from his own MPs as he trumpeted employment, GDP and wage figures.But perhaps he got a little carried away in his wording. Here are seven things he said that are either outright , or don’t stack up in context.  There are ‘more people in work than before the pandemic began’ This claim had been branded incorrect by the Office for Statistics Regulation just a day earlier in a letter to No. Director Ed Humpherson said the PM was referring to people on payrolls, but this excludes many self-employed. Mr Humpherson told Downing Street: The number of people on employer payrolls does not include everyone in work. ONS publishes data on the number of people in employment. The data for January – March  estimate that .m people were in employment compared with .m people in employment for September – November . It is therefore incorrect to state that there were more people in work at the end of this period than the start.  Tories are ‘lting the Living Wage - which this party introduced’ Tory Chancellor George Osborne introduced the National Living Wage in , but this was a rebranded version of the National Minimum Wage for over-s. That means the National Living Wage is, legally speaking, the same thing as the National Minimum Wage - which Labour introduced in . Importantly, the NLW is lower than the ‘real’ Living Wage which has been promoted for years by campaigners as the amount that meets everyday needs. The real Living Wage is currently £. or £. in London - compared to £. for the government’s National Living Wage, which will rise to £. in April. ‘In spite of all the dficulties we’ve faced, we have now got the fastest growth in the G. Absolutely true’ Technically yes, the UK’s GDP is forecast to grow by .% in  - the highest of any G country. But that is not the full picture - it also fell by .% in  according to the IMF, the worst of any G country. That means it’s now bouncing back faster too. According to the House of Commons Library, UK GDP was still down by .% in July-September  compared to pre-pandemic levels. This was the second-worst of any G country, behind Canada, Italy, Germany, the Eurozone, France and the US. The Commons Library also warned these figures are not % comparable across countries due to dferences in how output in the education and health sectors is calculated. ‘We’re getting , people off welfare and into work through our Way to Work plan’Tory ministers have set a ‘Way to Work’ target to help , Universal Credit claimants into work by June.But despite the PM’s boast, it’s thought the plan is only to get , people into jobs - not off Universal Credit. Sources told the Mirror some of those people are likely to continue claiming, at least in the short term, as around two-fths of UC claimants already have a job. They remain eligible for benefits because their wages are too low. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote a letter in April  ‘suggesting we could secure PPE supplies from a theatrical costumier and we could get ventilators from a professional football agentapos Ms Reeves did write a letter, and the firms it mentioned did include one behind ‘historic re-enactment clothing’ that was offering to make - gowns a week. However, the context is that she passed on the details of  firms that were offering to supply PPE - without actually endorsing their work.Instead her letter told Michael Gove : “You and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have.“But as they have not received a reply after contacting the Government, I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them.” Labour insist she was simply raising concerns about the number of firms at the time that were not getting a response.  Keir Starmer ‘would have kept us in lockdown’While he didn’t specy this time, Boris Johnson has repeatedly made this claim in relation to December  when Omicron surged.The Labour leader welcomed additional measures to curb Omicron rates before Christmas  - but he had never called for a lockdown. At one point Mr Starmer said: Weaposve got a government that are hinting at further restrictions but theyaposre more concerned and tied up with party management at the moment than it is with public health. The question on my lips and I think on the publicaposs lips is where is the prime minister One time Keir Starmer definitely did demand a lockdown was in autumn  - and Boris Johnson eventually caved and obeyed those calls a few weeks later. ‘We’ve opened Freeports across the country just in the last few days’Eight successful bidders for Freeports were announced at the March  Budget.Since then they have been working up their plans. Teesside opened in November and Thames in mid-December. But when we asked the government today, we were told the other six are yet to open. Neither the Mirror nor officials we asked could find evidence of new Freeports opening in the last month or so.

The UK and the EU agreed that goods from Great Britain must be checked at Northern Irelandaposs ports to ensure they comply with EU laws. But Mr Poots argued the checks are unlawful after seeking legal advice. Speaking at Stormont, Mr Poots said: I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on December   from midnight tonight.  I will prepare a paper for Executive consideration in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward. But it is unclear whether the senior civil servant in his department will comply with the order. Northern Irelandaposs Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill branded the decision a stunt. She said: This stunt is an attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic, and international law. DUP fixated on their own priorities, which are clearly at odds with where the wider community is at. The move comes amid ongoing tensions between the EU and the UK over a key part of the Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland protocol. The protocol was designed to prevent ato violence on the island of Ireland by avoiding a land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Island. Instead, a trade border was effectively created in the Irish Sea. Mr Johnson has spent most of the past two years trying to tear apart the Brexit deal he negotiated to reduce these checks, which have caused red tape and delays for businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has taken over the negotiations following the resignation of Brexit Minister Lord Frost, who repeatedly threatened to unilaterally tear up the deal.The DUP are opposed to the NI protocol, as they fear it means Northern Ireland is treated dferently to the rest of the UK.

Treasury insiders denied that Mr Johnson had set a precedent that other ministers should follow.  They said Mr Sunak had felt it was important to be visible and supportive of the Government on the day Sue Gray published an update of her report. The Chancellor later attended a crowded meeting of the Toriesapos backbench  committee in a show of solidarity with his beleaguered boss. And he led Treasury questions in the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday.  Mr Sunak, who was one of the only ministers wearing a facemask on the frontbench, tested negative before the Commons statement.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, sitting on Ms Patelaposs other side, later tested positive for Covid and was forced to miss her trip to the Ukraine with the PM. The legal requirement to stay at homeyou have a positive case in your household is no longer in place.But official NHS guidance still “strongly advises” people to limit close contact with others in crowded spaces and work from homepossible.It states that they should limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces. The advice adds that people should work from homeyou are able to and wear a face-covering in crowded places. A spokesman for Mr Sunak said: The Chancellor has followed the legal requirements to the letter. “He has taken daily lateral flow tests and has limited his social contact where possible, whilst also ensuring that he is able to continue to conduct important Government and Parliamentary business as the public would expect.  Just last month, No  announced Mr Johnson was unlikely to be seen in public for a week after a member of his immediate family, later revealed to be baby Romy, tested positive for Covid. The PMaposs official spokesman said he would heed official guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact, he told reporters. He’ll be working from No , doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No  and indeed inside No  as well, having limited contact with others in the building, and conducting meetings online.” However, Mr Johnson faced accusations he was hiding behind the illness, as it came while he faced intense scrutiny over his attendance at a BYOB garden party in No  during lockdown. The PM cancelled a visit to a vaccination centre in Lancashire, where he would have faced tough media questions, while a Downing Street press conference was also axed.

And like every victim, it has yet to realisethataposs the question, then itaposs time to go.  Yesterday, a report he resisted ordering was not published. Instead, there was an aposupdateapos on the alleged criminality of his office, his staff, and his personal residence, and the PM greeted it in the same way he has every Mirror front page, ITV broadcast, and BBC breaking news update since late November: a burst of surprise and contrition with a half-le of . seconds, decaying into toxic belligerence that will linger in the bone for a thousand years. Events for which there was not enough evidence to merit an investigation by the politan Police had, in the space of a month, uncovered  witnesses,  photographs, and  pieces of paper.Despite the insufficient evidence,  out of  parties, on  dates, have met the evidential threshold for an investigation, on the grounds that those involved knew they were against the rules, there was no reasonable justication for them, and not looking into it would end Cressida Dickaposs career quicker than sending the riot squad into a candlelit vigil.One of them is an alleged gathering in the Downing Street flat on November , , which Mrs Johnsonaposs personal spokeswoman has repeatedly insisted is total nonsense, but about which there seems to be enough evidence to merit weeks of attention by an entire squad of coppers.  While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. One of them is Leshie Chandrapala. Her dad drove a bus. He died of Covid, and Leshie was not allowed to be with him as he lay in a coma in ICU. She believes he died because he didnapost get PPE at work, but the government hasnapost even written a letter of condolence to her family. A fortnight after he died, and while she grieved, they threw the BYO booze Downing Street garden party. The PMaposs response to the report was to say sorry for the way itaposs been handled, not sorry for doing it. And he has a solution. I know what the issue is, he declared.

A suspected serial killer who evaded police for decades was given the nickname Toy Box Killer after kitting out a trailer with torture devices and holding women as \"sex slaves\"David Parker Rayand his lawyer Jeff Rein at the  trial Image: Getty ImagesByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsCynthia Vigil was just  years old when she was arrested by an undercover cop for soliciting sex illegally in a car park in . But after she was handcuffed by the mysterious officer, it didnapost take long for Cynthia to realise something was seriously wrong. Before she could resist, Cynthia was tasered, drugged and blindfolded. When she woke up, she was chained to a bed. This was when it became clear to the then sex worker that she hadnapost been arrested - sheaposd been abducted. The man who had kidnapped Cynthia was David Parker Ray, a sadistic serial rapist and torturer - who is suspected to have killed several women in his home state of New Mexico, US. Ray, who kept diaries including details of his victims, owned a repurposed trailer that heaposd soundproofed and kitted out with torture devices. And when his depraved crimes were finally revealed, they horried the community around him. Early le of a monster Ray, born in , was primarily raised by his grandparents who were believed to have run a strict, religious household. Growing up, Ray and his sister Peggy were sporadically visited by their violent, alcoholic father.  As the siblings grew up in a tiny rural town, Peggy became a popular, outgoing girl - while Ray remained shy and something of a loner. Although he didnapost have many friends at school and spent lots of time on his own, Ray wasnapost considered a troublemaker but showed signs of weird behaviour in childhood. From an early age heaposs believed to have taken an interest in pornography and violence, which he hid from those around him. It is also reported that Ray developed a fetish for broken bottles, keeping a stash of them in a dungeon heaposd built in the woods when he was . But after reaching adolescence, he lived a seemingly normal le and joined the US Army, receiving an honourable discharge at the end of his enlistment. Family and fatherhood Over the years Ray married several times and fathered lots of children, but he abandoned his families and only really bonded with a daughter he had - Glenda Jean Ray. Described as a Daddyaposs girl, Glenda Jean idolised her father and the pair were incredibly close as she got older. Their bond was even more unusual given that Ray had abandoned Glenda Jean, her mother and her siblings when they were young to live on the road and eventually adopt a hippy lestyle.  But just a few years later, he ed to Glenda Jeanaposs mum, who took him back. As Rayaposs beloved daughter developed into an adult she was tall, slim and blonde - looking much like a younger version of her dad. She also changed her name several times, going by Jessy to most people she knew. The relationship between Ray and Jessyaposs mum lasted another decade before he moved on to other women - including Cindy Hendy, who became his accomplice. The aposToy Boxapos To carry out his sick crimes, Ray bought an old trailer and converted it into a Toy Box, which included soundproofing and installing a gynaecological chair to strap victims into. The ceiling of the trailer was lined with mirrors, meaning the victims watched in horror at the torture he was inflicting on them. The rest of the Toy Box was kitted out with chains, whips, straps, clamps, saws and sex toys. Perhaps most disturbingly, the walls of the torture chamber were adorned with diagrams showing dferent methods of inflicting pain.  Ray is thought to have had several accomplices who helped him commit his unthinkable crimes, including friends and even girlfriends. When he was finally caught and the FBI raided the trailer, they found disturbing audio tapes heaposd recorded in which he told victims what was about to happen to them. One recording recovered reportedly told a victim she was going to be raped thoroughly and repeatedly, telling her she was a sex slave. Cynthiaaposs escape After kidnapping an unknown number of victims, Ray was finally caught in  when Cynthia Vigil escaped the Toy Box. She had spent three days chained to the gynaecologistaposs table in the torture trailer by Ray and three accomplices - girlfriend Cindy, daughter Jessy and friend Dennis Yancy. Seizing her opportunity for freedom after Ray had gone to work, Cynthia managed to grab the keys to her chains after Cindy left them on a nearby table. While she was unlocking herself, Cindy walked back into the room and a fight broke out between the two. But Cynthia managed to stab Hendy in the neck with an ice pick and make her escape.  Completely naked save for chains and a dog collar and covered in Cindyaposs blood, Cynthia fled and tried to flag down a passing car, before finding a house she considered safe and running inside. The homeowner covered her up and called the police. When they arrived, Cynthia recalled the gruesome tale and led cops to the location of the trailer. Ray and Hendy were swtly arrested - leading two other women to come forward claiming they had also been kidnapped and tortured by the sadist. Police investigations identied Jessy and Dennis Yancy as accomplices to the crimes - with Yancy admitting to murdering his girlfriend Marie Parker after Ray had kidnapped and tortured her. Trials and death Rayaposs attacks were separated into three trials for each woman who came forward against him. After the first trial had to be repeated, Ray was convicted of  counts of torture and sexual assault. The victim in the second trial sadly died before she could see justice, meaning no verdict was ever made. Eventually in , Ray was sentenced to  years in prison for ious offences in the abduction and torture of his victims. He was soon dubbed the Toy Box Killer as cops believed he was responsible for up to  murders - but no bodies relating to his crimes were ever recovered. Jessy Ray was given a sentence of nine years while Cindy Hendy was given  years in prison. On  May , Ray was taken to a facility in New Mexico to be questioned by state police. Shortly before the interrogation took place, he had a heart attack and died. Since managing to escape from the Toy Box, Cynthia Vigil has gone on to have a family, but she has shared her story in the hope other victims of evil Ray will come forward. Recalling her ordeal to reporters in , she said: This was a very sick man. The only thing that gives me any comfort is that he’s gone. If I didn’t get away, I wouldn’t have my three wonderful boys. I wouldn’t be here.

It then continued to grow through the propertyaposs cavity walls and eventually it would have forced the walls apartit hadnapost been tackled. The only way to solve the problem was to dig up the ground floor of the Hampshire house and remove hundreds of metres of bamboo rhizomes. The home insurance claim for the damage was apparently more than £,, reports the Express.Japanese Knotweed is famously a nightmare, but experts have said bamboo can be just as baditaposs left to grow unmonitored. The roots of bamboo can travel up to a whopping  metres and they can break through all sorts of surfaces, from bricks and drains to cavity walls and patios.  aposRunningapos ieties of bamboo like the one found at the Hampshire property are particularly prolic as they send lateral shoots out underneath the ground which can sometimes pop up on neighboursapos plots. Founder and MD of Environet UK, Nic Seal, told the Sun: Through no fault of their own, the homeowners have suffered signicant financial cost, stress and inconvenience, being required to vacate their home for several months. The truth is, most bamboos are invasiveplanted directly into the ground and left to their own devices. He added that the Hampshire case was the worst case of bamboo encroachment heaposd ever seen in this country. Experts advise itaposs best to choose a clumping iety of bamboo rather than a running iety to avoid spreading problems like these. Those buying bamboo should also plant it in a pot instead of in the ground and make sure to trim it frequently.

This will not be tolerated.Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcallingImage: Getty Images AlloyopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Feb |commentsIt probably seems like a small thing, at best. At worst, a waste of time and resources. It’s not though. It’s important. A tiny triumph. A baby step in the right direction. Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcalling – “targeting people who are shouting things from their vehicles at women girls. This will not be tolerated.” Last week they stopped a van after the occupant yelled at some women who turned out to be plain-clothed police officers. Oh to have seen his face. He was reported for a breach of the Public Spaces Protection Order and is likely to be issued with a £ fine or taken to court, which is another way of saying that he was left in no doubt that THIS IS NOT OK. That’s apparently what men need to be told, reminded of, in no uncertain terms, so they’re one hundred per cent clear. No, it’s not just a bit of harmless fun that we need to lighten up about. It’s horrendous. Scary. Humiliating.  Maybe this concept is confusing because we’re living in an age of sharing, honesty, and talking about everything. Mostly that’s great, but somewhere within this, a simple truth has got lost. Sometimes, it’s good NOT to talk. Sometimes, you need to shut the hell up. Perhaps we need a massive advertising campaign, public service announcement telly commercials and posters everywhere to clearly inform everyone once and for all: Stop telling women what you think of their bodies. Especially when they haven’t asked, which is pretty much always. There are no Thought Police – anyone is free to think whatever they like. The opinions inside someone’s head can’t hurt anyone . The problem comes when they’re broadcast out loud to the woman you’re thinking them about, be it on the street, online, or on a radio show, like that fool who talked about Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay. What you think of the woman’s body is irrelevant, by the way. Evenyou believe it’s a compliment, still keep it to yourself. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but most women do not feel flattered and delighted when a stranger gives them positive feedback about a body part. We feel embarrassed, and frightened. And we’re taught to ignore this behaviour – apart from in Bradford, it’s up to us to deal with it ourselves – to put our heads down, walk quicker, in case the situation escalates.We’re luckywe are only verbally harassed. Even online, where the threat of physical violence is removed, these kind of comments are dangerous, and unacceptable. They perpetuate the belief that women’s appearances are fair game for discussion and debate. That our bodies are anyone’s business but our own. They also ensure that the practice of speaking about women in this way seeps down to future generations, continuing the cycle. It has to stop. As the fight to make our streets safer for women goes on, catcalling being taken seriously in one city in the UK is just a drop in the ocean. But at least it’s a start. Maybe those TV ads aren’t a bad idea – and it’s obvious what music they should be set to. Ronan Keating, You Say It Best, When You Say Nothing At All.

James Bradshaw, , says the builder, who heaposd hired to add a two-storey extension to their house, would only work five-hour days and when confronted about his shoddy workmanship brazenly quit saying he didnapost want the stress .The couple agreed to pay almost £, to the builder, who came recommended by a family friend, for an extension to accommodate their growing family, a job that was supposed to be completed by August . But after months of issues and delays the builder vanished in September, leaving James and his family £, out of pocket and living on a building site. The -year-old says he has since had a surveyor assess the work that had been done, who concluded that it needed to be completely demolished and restarted due to structural issues. When James contacted a solicitor he was advised not to bother taking the builder to court as he wonapost see a penny of his hard-earned savings again - evenhe wins the case.  The sales director has now shared photos of the mess heaposs been left with in a bid to warn other conscientious and decent peopleapos not to fall victim to cowboy builders. James, from Wolverhampton, said: The reason we were having the extension done is because weaposve had a daughter and we have three children living with us already - my son and my fianceaposs two children. We were having the extension done to create two extra bedrooms and to extend the kitchen and dining room to have a bit more space for the kids. It was shocking from day one. He never did a full week, heaposd only turn up two to three times a weekat all and heaposd turn up at :am and leave at pm. Every time the building inspector came to review the work heaposd done it kept getting failed so he had to redo lots of it. Eventually I said to him aposyou need to come in for a meeting because this just isnapost good enoughapos. As he walked through the door he said aposIaposm going to give you your money back and you can get someone  to complete it because I canapost get it done and I donapost want the stress anymoreapos. He only offered us £, back and I just said aposyouaposre a joke and youaposll be hearing from our solicitoraposs. He left our house in the state itaposs in and we havenapost spoken to him since. Itaposs been a nightmare. Itaposs put a lot of strain on mine and my partneraposs le and caused a lot of devastation for our family. Weaposd been saving the money for about  years and weaposd got a loan to help as well which weaposre still paying back at the minute.  The two-storey extension was supposed to create two extra bedrooms and an extended kitchen and dining area within  weeks, for an agreed cost of £,. By the time of their final meeting in September - two months after the extension was supposed to be finished - there was only an incomplete single-storey and a plank of wood blocking where the back door used to be. The following month, an independent building survey confirmed that what was built was plagued with structural issues and needed to be completely demolished and restarted, despite the parents already forking out a whopping £,. The report found that the walls were out of square in numerous places and either had a cavity that was too wide or cavity ties that were too short. This means they werenapost fully tied in and didnapost provide full stability. It also noted that the entire structure was at risk of damp due to multiple issues, including mortar breaching the wall cavities, and aposlazy workmanshipapos was evident in the internal brickwork, where a broken brick aposlooked to have been jammed in placeapos. Overall the report concluded: Considering the overall condition of the build we would recommend that it is removed down to foundation level and the structure started again. Demolishing the work alone would cost an additional £. In light of this, James sought legal advice to try and claw back some of his hard-earned savings back to be able to recty the nightmare build.  But the dad says that his solicitor then delivered the devastating news that although he would definitely win in court he would never see a penny of the £, again because the builder could simply close the business down due to not having the funds to repay it. James said: I had a meeting with the solicitor and said aposdonapost tell me what I want to hear, tell me the honest truthapos. Her words were aposthe only person that wins in this is the solicitors because we get paid either way, itaposs going to cost you £, to £, to go to courtapos. She said aposyou will win in court but his solicitor will advise him to shut the company down because he hasnapost got the money to pay it back so you wonapost see a pennyapos.Two days after we received the court letter it came up on Facebook that the company was closed so I think heaposs already shut it down. Weaposve looked into his history a bit now as well and heaposs well known for opening companies and shutting them down - I think this is the fourth company heaposs done that with since . The family had new builders start at their home last week to demolish the unstable structure and restart the extension. But at a new estimated cost of £,, they can no longer afford to get much of the project done. The heartbroken dad hopes that by warning people about the dishonest and unreliable cowboy he fell victim to, he can help other families avoid the same fate. James said: Thereaposs nothing we can do now, we just have to bite the bullet that weaposre not going to get anything from it because the system doesnapost support this kind of thing. Weaposve got new builders in now but because weaposve wasted so much money we can only afford to get the shell done and weaposll have to do the inside stage by stage. The new quote to put right and finish it is £, because thereaposs been a huge increase in prices of building materials and labour as well as the extra work of demolishing it.

Prosecutor Sara Anthony told Cheltenham Magistrates Court that a year ago Awdry was disqualied for le from owning, keeping, transporting or being in any way involved with dogs. The ban was imposed in February  at Gloucester Crown Court after Awdry and two other defendants were convicted for selling puppies without a licence, and failing to meet the needs of the animals. The puppies were kept in squalid conditions at Awdryaposs home and were poorly looked after. Awdry and his two accomplices were estimated to have made £, from puppy farming over four years. Yesterday, Ms Anthony told the court that the Forest of Dean District Council was tipped off that Awdry was still using dogs for work and had been seen transporting his dogs about, shortly after his dog ban was imposed. On April ,  at .am two members of the councilaposs street warden team were in the Bream area and were travelling along Oakwood Road when they spotted Awdry in a white Nissan vehicle beside a five bar gate,” Ms Anthony said. “They both had a clear view of a black and white Collie sitting on the front passenger seat. They watched Awdry turn the vehicle around and drive to the other side of the field and park alongside an outbuilding. They both saw Awdry unload two Collie dogs from the vehicle and usher them towards the outbuilding. Awdry was then observed ing to his vehicle without the dogs. Awdry drove down Highfield Close and disappeared from the area. The street wardens checked the outbuilding and observed that the two dogs were inside. While the wardens were making notes of what they had just witnessed Awdry ed in his van accompanied by his we. He parked beside the outbuilding and opened the door while Mrs Awdry encouraged the dogs into the vehicle from the passenger side. Awdry ed to the vehicle and drove off. On the second occasion the district council was contacted by PC Katherine McDay who was driving in a marked vehicle from Coleford to Bream on May  last year at around pm when she noticed Awdryaposs Nissan van on the B near the area of Bream Cross. She noticed a large amount of sheep coming from a field opposite. Pc McDay travelled past the Nissan and turned around. While she travelled back towards the van she noticed that Awdry was driving and his we was in the passenger seat with a black Collie dog on her lap. As Pc McDay passed she noticed that the dog was released out of the passenger door and it began herding sheep along the road. A short while later she noticed Awdry drive away from the area and saw that the sheep were no longer visible. The dog had its head out of the passenger window. Clive Rees, defending, said: I feel that Awdry did not fully understand the rules surrounding the disqualication order. He was under the impression thathe had somebody with him who was responsible for the dogs he would be complying with the terms of the order. Awdry had already transferred ownership of the dogs to his we. He has kept dogs all his le and, being a commoner, he has the right to roam sheep on the common. He frequently gets calls from police to remove them from the road, eventhey are not his own sheep. When the order was initially issued Awdry would get his we to drive his van with the dogs. However over the past few months Mrs Awdryaposs health has deteriorated and she has recently lost much of her eyesight and most of her hearing. Mr Awdry has become her carer. Awdry started the order with good intentions. His son has now taken over the responsibility for the dogs. Whoever saw the dogs, there was no mention of them being concerned about the animalsapos welfare. In the future Awdry will have to come to terms about not looking after sheep in future. He realises now that he is in a serious position. He should have known the position when he was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court. Awdry pleaded guilty to breaching a disqualication order imposed after conviction on two occasions. On or around April ,  at Lydney, having been previously disqualied from keeping dogs he transported two black and white collie dogs inside a white Nissan white van, and on May ,  he transported a black and white collie dog inside the same van whilst directing  sheep to exit a field and move along the B Rd heading towards Bream. Presiding Justice Major Paul Adey sentenced Awdry to six weeks imprisonment for the two offences of transporting dogs and activated the  week suspended sentence consecutively. We note that the dogs are no longer in your and Mrs Awdryaposs ownership, a move which should have been undertaken  months ago, said the magistrate. “We also acknowledge that the dogs have not been mistreated whilst they have been in your care. The justices ordered that outstanding court costs of £, and the £, costs of yesterdayaposs case must be paid by Awdry by th April this year. After yesterdayaposs hearing Forest of Dean District Councilaposs Animal Welfare Member Champion, Councillor Nicky Packer said Our Street Warden team do a fantastic job year round of ensuring that animals in our district are looked after properly, and that those who mistreat or cause harm to their animals are held accountable.” This verdict should stand as testament to this. A ban on keeping dogs means exactly that. If, as in this case, it isnapost followed, our Street Warden and Counter Fraud and Enforcement team will enforce it. A council spokesperson added The prosecution was undertaken by Forest of Dean District Councilaposs Legal Services team working with the Councilaposs Street Wardens Team and Counter Fraud and Enforcement Unit .

The -year-old mum of two - who is a full-time carer to disabled son Tommy, aged  - has now lived without heating for more than a month.“Itaposs really upsetting because I feel like a failure of a mother. I can choose between keeping my house warm at the moment and feeding the kids. “And the kids need to be fed but they need to be warm, it’s quite upsetting. No one should have to choose between feeding or eating.” Beth is one of the . million UK householders whose heating is powered by oil as her home in the rural hamlet of Dartshill, Somerset does not have a mains gas supply.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Her problem started as the cost to heat her family home, which she rents, rose sharply - from £ to £ for  litres, to fill less than half the tank.The cost of living crisis has left the mum, Tommy, five, and Gabby, three, forced to share a bed each night.They have a tiny electric heater to warm the bedroom they share, but in the evenings, they can see their breath in their living room when the temperature drops. Desperate to keep her children warm, Beth bundles them up in jumpers and scarves at home - but Tommy, who is autistic, struggles to wear the outfits. She says: “We’re wearing a lot of extra layers and having to sleep in the same bed to keep warm. “I shut the bedroom door to keep our body heat in but as soon as we got downstairs, it is freezing and we’re all shivering. “It’s a very old draughty cottage, I woke up the other morning around  am to find ice around the windowsill. “We’re wearing a lot more clothes, which means a lot more washing and a backlog of clothes as we wait days for things to dry. “It’s also a choice when it comes to hot water -the kids have a bath, I can’t have a shower as well.” She added: “I have no money and I’m worried about the kids getting ill because it is so cold. “February and March can be the coldest months so I needed to get something done quickly.” Tommy, aged five, is “very delayed” and has to wear specic clothes, meaning he doesn’t like wearing the extra layers.Beth is unable to work after becoming his full-time carer due to his severe epilepsy and the family rely on Universal Credit to get by.She previously tried to get a loan but was refused as she still owes around £ from the last loan she received. “I’ve tried everything. I even tried to get a grant in my local area but I heard nothing back,” the mum said. She also claims disability allowance to support him, who spent nine weeks in hospital in , suffering constant seizures. He has to wear a helmet to protect himselfhe falls, and mum Beth is on constant alert for his seizures. “Because of his epilepsy and autism, he is very delayed, and he doesn’t understand why we need to wear these extra clothes,” added Beth. “So trying to keep him warm it’s really dficult, he’s used to having heating and now we don’t have it. “It’s very frustrating for him.”  The desperate mum recently turned toGoFundMeto help cover the £ bill - where one kindhearted stranger donated £ anonymously.The hike in the price of oil comes amid a cost of living crisis with Beth’s rent recently rising by £ per month - a rise she will struggle to cover.

She said: “We scrape by every month, it’s dficult. With Universal Credit, I don’t knowthey’ll cover the rent increase. “As a single mum on benefits, £ is a lot of money. “Tommy’s school is about half an hour away so I do an hour-round journey every day to get him there. “It got to the point where I was desperate for heating and I just had to set up a GoFundMe page.” She plans to donate any excess to the Daisy Garland charity, that supported her family while Tommy was in the hospital.Donate to Beth’sGoFundMehere.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsOil pricesSingle mumEpilepsyAsperger’s syndromeEnergy bills\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tests continued tonegative and the family felt nobody could explain what was wrong with him. Brian was found aposunable to moveapos on May  last year after bending down to wash his hands. Little did we know that our world was about to be blown apart, Alyson said. My dad suddenly was unable to move and we had to call an ambulance. It came to light that my dadaposs femur and hip had split open but there was no logical reason for this he hadnapost banged himself or had a fall. On the May  after much investigation it came to light that my dad had myeloma and was very poorly. He wasnapost even awake so I couldn’t tell him how much I loved him and that he had to fight. The next day, Alyson said she had to discuss a do-not-resuscitate order with her fatheraposs consultant. What a shocker, she said, we only found out about the cancer the day before and he only came into hospital  days before that. How can things be this bad so quick  May  was one of the worst days of our le, Alyson continued. We got a call to say come in, Dad wasnapost going to be pulling through, and would not make the weekend. To this point we had all been restricted to seeing my dad because of Covid but now we were allowed to be by his side. I cannot emphasise what a shock this week had been to us all. How quick the tide had turned in our le. What I can tell you is from my own point of view the heart-breaking pain I felt, Iaposd never felt pain like it and it was like I could not breathe and my world had crashed into a million pieces.  Sadly, a lot of families go through this journey leading to their diagnosis. Another reason why knowledge, awareness, training and earlier diagnosis is so important. Myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that occurs in the bone marrow. It currently affects more than , people in the UK. On average,  people are diagnosed with Myeloma every day in the UK. Alyson said: My dad had fallen sick in October  and despite many tests ran nothing came to light. Even a few weeks before May st, Dad had more tests done and still nothing had shown up, even in the blood tests for cancer. Going back through my dadaposs medical history it is now thought that his myeloma could go back  years when it was at the apossmoulderingapos stage but right up to him being hospitalised nothing ever came to light. The myeloma had remained undetected. Another reason why a better diagnosis system needs to be found. Despite being told he had just days to live, Brian went home in July - a day that Alyson says is one they never thought we would see. Brian is said to have responded well to chemotherapy - but the damage done to his body cannot be reversed. He is on chemotherapy every day to give him some extra time. Another dficult side to Myeloma is that it does y from person to person and besides the cancer, myeloma can come with many other complications. For my dad it is his heart and lungs. Now Alyson and husband Alan, who run Alan Yates Music, are planning to do weekly gigs throughout March this year in a bid to fund the research into a cure for Myeloma.Alyson is immunocompromised, meaning her immune system is extremely weak and she is at higher risk of contracting Covid-.Myeloma may become curable but funds are required for that and funds are required to help those in today’s society where there isnapost a cure, she said. She said she wanted to support Myeloma UK to help fund research into a cure and to raise awareness of Myeloma so “it doesn’t happen to anybody . We went through a horrendous journey as a family and the thought of another family going through that… I just can’t”. Myeloma UK is the only organisation in the UK exclusively dedicated to Myeloma and its related conditions. They rely almost entirely on voluntary donations and fundraising. Their ultimate goal is to find a cure for Myeloma and until then aim to help every patient live well with the diagnosis for as long as possible.To find out more about myeloma and the work of Myeloma UK click here.

Following Dianaaposs death in  she was buried on a small island on the wider estate in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake.  Although the monarchy has now changed to put sons and daughters on an equal footing in terms of ascending to the throne, British primogeniture law has not been changed for peers such as dukes and earls.This means Louis will inherit Althorp rather than his oldest sister Kitty, who married -year-old businessman Michael Lewis in a grand ceremony in Italy last year.In a previous interview, Kitty, , said: Primogeniture can be a tricky topic because as times are changing, attitudes are as well. Weaposve grown up understanding that itaposs Louis to inherit, and Louis will do an incredible job. Meanwhile, her father Earl Spencer suggested it would go against the tradition of Althorp House to overlook his son.

It was bought for just £ in  by the airportaposs chief executive Suzannah Harvey when British Airways retired its fleet early due to the pandemic, and has been a labor of love ever since. Suzannah said: I paid a pound for her, and we have a certain obligation to maintain it as is practical for public use. The company has had to spend nearly £, getting her prepped and ready here, but I think itaposs money well spent and it preserves her for future generations.  Most of the original structure has stayed the same but the transformation has included stripping out the economy section to create the events space and turning the gallery into a bar. A full rewiring with custom lighting has been done while it also took one man a whole week and a half to give it a good clean inside and out. Suzannah described the renovation process as a “long old slog”.  “She came into us in October , and at the time I rather naively thought weaposd have her up and running by the following Easter,” she said. Weaposve had such tremendous support from everybody. All the contractors, all the people that have volunteered who are current BA  engineers - and here we are finally. “Sheaposs ready and sheaposs good to go. The Negus entered the British Airways fleet on  February , operating , flights - flying for , hours over nearly  million miles.  Its last passenger flight was from Miami to Heathrow on  April, .Anyone now wanting to host a party onboard will have to pay more than £, an hour but Suzannah said they had been inundated with enquiries - including from Netflix.Suzannah added: The vision has finally come to fruition, with overwhelming support from volunteers including current BA engineers and half a million pounds of investment later, Negus  is finally ready.  Preserved for many years to come and future generations, Negus is the only bespoke events  in the world. Cotswold Airport is family owned and operated and is the largest privately owned airport in Europe having a runway only m shorter than Bristol International. Suzannah said an app will soon be launched to enable the general public to book tours of the aircraft.

And although members of the Firm are mainly very polite when it comes to dealing with their staff, there are quirky and sometimes bizarre requests that they make. From elaborate bath routines to very specic sandwiches - here we take a look at some of them... Prince Charlesapos bath demands Prince Charles has a team of staff, who also help out with his very strict and somewhat unusual morning routine - that sets him up for the day ahead.  An insight into his routine was once revealed by Princess Dianaaposs friend and former butler Paul Burrell, who worked closely with the family in the s.Speaking during Amazon Primeaposs documentary Serving the Royals: Inside the Firm, Mr Burrell revealed: His pyjamas are pressed every morning and his shoe laces are pressed flat with an iron. And when it comes to his morning bath, Mr Burrell added that the prince also has some very specic requests. He also told the documentary: The water temperature has to be just tepid, and only half full.” The ex-butler also added that the bath plug must face specic direction, his bath towel must be arranged to his taste and his underwear can’t be a crease out of place.

Prince Andrewaposs teddy bears A former royal protection officer claimed that Prince Andrew has a very specic set up of his cuddly toys. It is said that the Duke of York sketched out a plan for how his five teddies and cuddly toys should be positioned on his bed every night. The toys are said to include two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. The sketch allegedly shows exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed. The instructions were laminated and titled “DOY bed: Points for turn down  making the bed”, with Andrew said to keep the accompanying sketch close to his bed while staying at Buckingham Palace. Charlesapos breakfast request  Another unusual request when it comes to eating breakfast is by Prince Charles.According to former royal chef Darren McGrady, the heir to the throne would always ask for two plums with breakfast - but only eat one, reports MyLondon.McGrady said: The instruction was to put two plums and a little juice into the bowl and send it into him for breakfast. Iaposd send in two plums and he would take one so it would come back out after breakfast and Iaposd put the other plum back into the jar and save it. The former chef continued: One morning I thought, aposok, he only eats one for breakfast,apos so I only put one plum into the bowl and sent it out into the dining room. The attending [waiter] came through and said, aposcan His Royal Highness have two please apos So I had to keep sending two in every morning. Kateaposs name plea Although not strictly a royal at the time as she was not yet married to Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge once issued a bizarre request.Kateaposs proper first name is Catherine, but became known as Kate while at St Andrews University. Even though her full name is Catherine, his university girlfriend became known as Kate as the world ponderedshe would be our future Queen.However, it was been reported she wasnapost actually a fan of the name aposKateapos and even emailed her friends in , two years before her engagement, asking them to call her Catherine instead.Writing for the Sunday Express at the time, columnist Adam Helliker said: With Prince William’s engagement now a surefire certaintythere are intriguing signs that Kate Middleton is preparing for her future role. It looks like she’s taking it very seriously indeed too. I hear that in the past few weeks the former accessories buyer has quietly informed friends that she would like to drop the informal ‘Kate’ and in future wishes to be known by her full name: aposCatherineapos.

Mum Jenny Hill, from Lincoln, was stunned when -year-old Bella was born with a head of half blonde and half brunette hair.Since then, gobsmacked passersby admire her hair and constantly quiz her about whether she dyes it or not. Student nurse Jenny, , believes that the distinctive trait is caused by poliosis, which creates a lack of pigment in a patch of hair. The schoolgirl even has dferent coloured eyelashes - her right lashes are a light colour while her left ones are dark. Bellaaposs unique barnet means that every morning she can decide whether she wants to embrace her blonde or brunette side depending on the parting - making the decision based on her outfit. Jenny, from Lincoln, Lincolnshire, said: Itaposs really dferent and unique. My mum pointed it out when she was born but at the time I was in too much pain to notice. She was saying sheaposs fair and I said sheaposs dark then we noticed her eyelashes were fair on the blonde side and dark on the brunette side. I asked about it at her six-week check-up and they kind of just said aposoh yesapos and didnapost make a big deal out of it. As parents itaposs more noticeable because you stare at your baby but itaposs more prominent as sheaposs got older. In the summer the darker side does go fairer. The blonde is an ice blonde, like itaposs been bleached and it goes all the way underneath in an unusual pattern. If she has it in a certain style, sheaposs blonde butshe changes her parting, sheaposs brunette. She prefers her hair lighter when she wears more girly clothes and pastel colours but when she wears her hoodies and joggers, she wears it up so itaposs dark. Bella said: I donapost really have a favourite shade, it depends what outfit Iaposm wearing. A lot of school friends do want my hair and some askI dye it. The mum-of-three suspects the rare feature is caused by poliosis as neither of her other children, Riley,  or Lilah, four, have inherited it. Jenny admits that Bellaaposs unique aposdo garners a lot of attention with strangers askingthey colour her hair. Others joke that Jenny aposmust have inhaled a lot of bleachapos while working as a hairdresser when pregnant with her. Jenny said: We got a lot of attention when she was little. It would take us hours to get round the supermarket because people would stop and admire Bellaaposs hair or askweaposd dyed it. I was a hairdresser when I was pregnant with Bella so it was a running joke that maybe Iaposd been around the bleach too much. A lot of people donapost notice her eyelashes but itaposs obvious when you look at her. She gets told by everyone that she isnapost allowed to touch her hair. Weaposve only ever seen similar hair once. We were in the supermarket once and we saw another boy with a patch of hair like Bellaaposs. It was really exciting. Bella pointed him out and said aposheaposs got hair like meapos so we went over because we havenapost seen anyone  before.

Despite the backlash, headteacher Brian Mulheran, of the Citipointe Christian College, has doubled down and given parents an extra two weeks to sign their children up. The contract was sent to families last Friday and said the college will only enrol the student on the basis of the gender that corresponds to their biological sex. It also asserted that homosexuality, along with bestiality, incest and paedophilia, was sinful. One teacher, who also has a student at the college, has already resigned saying young people within the LGBTQ+ community deserve to feel safe while at school. Helen Clapham Burns was also a teacher at the school in Carindale, Australia, but quit on Monday saying she couldnapost continue to work for a school that would do that to children.  Mrs Burns said: Iaposm heartbroken. I feel like Iaposve let them down that Iaposm having to leave. But I have to let those queer kids know that there are Christians out there that love them and arenapost hiding behind Bible verses and are letting them know that they are safe with me. As an educator, my priority is to make sure that each child that I interact with feels safe. When a child tells us, with tears in their eyes, that they donapost feel safe, what are we doing  Mr Mulheran made a video for parents about the contract. In it he said he had listened to their concerns and wanted them to make the right decisions for themselves. The declaration of faith has been in place for the whole of last year, he said.  We want families to consider this ethos so that they can make the right decisions for themselves. He added: We have always held these Christian beliefs and we have tried to be fair and transparent to everyone in our community by making them clear in the enrolment contract. We are seeking to maintain our Christian ethos and to give parents and students the right to make an informed choice about whether they can support and embrace our approach to Christian education. Citipointe does not judge students on their sexuality or gender identity and we would not make a decision about their enrolment in the College simply on that basis.  A group of parents has said they want to file a complaint to the Human Rights Commission, arguing they were not consulted about the contract and that the college was discriminating against students on the basis of sexuality and gender identity. One parent who is asked not to be named said: The contract they put out is so blatantly damaging to anyone within the school who identies within the LGBTQI umbrella are not of their highest concern. But nor is anybody  who believes in standing up against this kind of discrimination, because the contract makes it clear that any kind of act that goes against this belief is something that can be disciplined. Federal Member for Moncref, Angie Bell, told ABC Radio in Brisbane she disagreed with the college lumping students who are unsure about their sexuality or unsure about their gender identity ... with the likes paedophiles and adulterers. No school child should be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, their gender identity, their pregnancy status, or their relationship status, which are the four elements that are in that section of the Sex Discrimination Act, she said.Religious organisations also have the right to practise their faith … without a doubt … notitaposs done in a discriminatory fashion. This is not  anymore … this is a new year, this is a new decade, this is a new Australia and there is no room.

But when she started dated one of the worldaposs most eligible bachelors, Prince Harry, she was determined to keep things quiet while she worked outhe was The One.The couple successfully kept their relationship a secret for five months, flying between Canada and London to see each other, enjoying cosy nights in at his Kensington Palace cottage. But they knew it was only a matter of time before their perfect, private bubble burst. When news that Harry had been secretly dating the Suits star was leaked, they had only a few hours to prepare before it appeared on the front pages.  But the realisation that this was aposher new leapos, terried Meghan, claims royal journalists, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand.

They wrote: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours. They had little time to think because there was only a couple of paparazzi in Toronto but it wouldnapost be long before photographers flew in from New York and LA, all hoping to get that first picture of the happy couple. Harry was inundated with calls from staff who encouraged him toto London as soon as possible since he had a smaller security team than normal. But, he refused to leave. Scobie and Durand claim that while Meghan was nervous about what was to come, she was relieved that the secrecy and lies to friends and family would be coming to an end. They said: Prior to meeting Harry, the only times she experiences cameras were on a set or on a red carpet. The security was necessary. Shortly after the news broke, a photographer from an LA-based photo agency had scaled the fence into her back garden and waited for Meghan by her car, hoping to get a picture before she headed out to run errands. Meghan was terried and called the police. aposThis is how itaposs always going to be, isnapost it apos, she said to a friend.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

She doted on her step-brotheraposs three-year-old and felt the pair had a strong connection. But when she received a call from a family member, her blood ran cold as she heard what had happened. Her brother Stephen Waterson, the adopted son of a former government minister Nigel Waterson, had fatally crushed tragic Alfie, by slamming his car seat into the tragic toddler. After that, Samantha, , gave evidence for the prosecution - which helped ensure her brother was jailed after being convicted of manslaughter.  Now she has described her terror after Waterson was released early from jail - and slammed the authorities for failing to noty her of her brotheraposs release.Samantha, , now fears for her own safety after his early release. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereSingle mum of five, Samantha said: “Stephen should both be serving le in my opinion. He took a childaposs le, and he should pay for it. In court, I gave evidence against him, and I knew I was taking a risk but I wanted to do the right thing. Imagine my horror when I read in the press this morning that he had been released early.I feel absolutely sick. The police and prison system didnapost even have the decency to let me know. I have no idea of the terms of his licence orhe is allowed to come near me.I am now living in fear, for myself and for my children. I worry that he will come looking for me.Three-year-old Alfie Lamb was crushed to death by a car seat after his mother placed him into the footwell of an Audi.Waterson, then , was jailed for manslaughter in November  for seven and half years after slamming his car seat into the toddler and was not due for release until . Alfieaposs mother, Adrian Hoare was jailed for two years and nine months for child cruelty. Samantha, who is Stephen’s half-sister, is haunted by Alfieaposs death.Samantha, from Blackpool, says: Alfie was cute and I loved him. I felt we had a connection and I loved buying him treats. But his parents were rough with him, they would smack him and shout at him. He was well looked after in the way that he was well dressed and fed and clean. But he was not well-loved.“On one occasion, we were all in the car and Alfie was squashed in the foot-well. I was horried. He actually said: ‘Mummy, I can’t move.’I shouted at Stephen to move him. I didn’t know they did this as a routine – and that it would soon kill Alfie.  “When I heard Alfie was dead, my mind went back to the day in the car and I wished I had been more forceful – could I have saved him ”Stephen and Samantha grew up in a chaotic family in South London. They had the same mother and there was a seven-year age gap between them.Samantha says: I remember Stephen clearly he was a little toddler and I used to love playing with him. I looked after him because he was the baby.”But the family was troubled and Samantha was in and out of foster care throughout her childhood. Stephen was eventually adopted into a new family and they lost contact.In , Stephen made contact via Facebook.She says: “He came to visit me and I was pleased to see him again he was my brother. But I also thought he seemed nasty and aggressive and he wanted to borrow money.”Stephen was a guest at Samantha’s wedding the following year.She says: “He would visit me every now and again, always bringing a dferent girlfriend, often with a child. I enjoyed seeing him, but he was basically coming for a free holiday in Blackpool.I saw a side to him and I didn’t like it. He kept telling me how he was going for custody of the dferent kids he kept bringing – I told him to concentrate on his own family and not be so silly. To my mind, he wasn’t really fit to be looking after other kids.”Samantha’s step-uncle, Richard, had a relationship with Adrian Hoare, and they had Alfie together. When their relationship finished, Hoare began a relationship with Stephen Waterson.Samantha says: It was complicated, but it meant that I had a close relationship with Alfie. He was a really cute little boy. I got on OK with his mum, Adrian, too. But I didn’t know her too well.Late in , Stephen came up to Blackpool to see me – and this time he brought Adrian and Alfie with him. I was surprised to see they were together. Alfie was two and a half and loved playing with some minion toys I had.I felt I really had a connection with him. But Stephen and Adrian were both rough with him. They slapped him when he started crying. Once he threw his dummy on the floor so Stephen threw him on the couch. They swore at him. Adrian would say: ‘I will give you something to cry for.’I told Stephen that was no way to treat a child and I was worried about him. Alfie appeared well looked after he was clean, well-dressed, well-fed. But I did not feel he was loved.On every visit, I tried to make sure I bought him a toy or gave him a little treat, because I loved him and I felt sorry for him.” On one trip to London, to visit Stephen, six weeks before Alfie’s death, Samantha says Alfie was made to sit in the footwell of the car because there was no space on the seats.Samantha says: Alfie could not move, there was not enough room for him. I was horried. Alfie actually said: ‘Mummy, I can’t move.’ The irony was, Alfie actually had a car seat but Stephen just shoved it in the boot.”In February , Samantha learned from family members that Alfie was dead.She says: I was devastated. When I heard that he had been squashed in the footwell, I was physically sick. My mind went back to the day in the car and I wished I had been more forceful – could I have saved him ” Samantha contacted the police and was a prosecution witness at the trial.Hoare and Waterson had admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice by lying to police. Hoare was found guilty of child cruelty.Waterson was convicted of intimidating a witness and Hoare of assaulting another witness.Waterson later admitted Alfie’s manslaughter by gross negligence.  Samantha says: I took a big risk by turning against my own brother in court, but I knew I had to tell the truth. Now, I fear I will be made to pay the price.It is disgusting that the authorities did not let me know about his release. I have called the police to tell them of my concerns, but I havenapost yet been offered any protection or support.All of this brings back the memories of Alfieaposs death and it is very hard. I think of that little boy every day.Sources told The Sun Alfieaposs family would receive an official apology over the miscommunication. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: aposThis was a despicable crime and our sympathies remain with the family. aposWaterson has been released under probation supervision after serving the prison part of his sentence but can be ed therehe breaches the strict conditions he is under.apos Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AdoptionCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cristiano Ronaldo said his -year-old son isn’t allowed a phoneCristiano Ronaldo is refusing to cave in Image: Visionhaus Getty ImagesopinionByEva Simpson:,  Feb |comments I don’t have much in ­common with Cristiano Ronaldo.He’s a multimillionaire ­footballer with luxurious homes across the world and an army of fans and followers on social media. I’m a mum working from a wobbly table in the kitchen. So I was surprised to find out there is one thing we agree on: our attitude towards ­children and gadgets.Earlier this week the Manchester United star revealed his -year-old son Cristiano Jnr – who presumably could have anything money can buy – isn’t allowed a phone, despite constantly pestering him for one.Ronaldo warned of the dangers of being “obsessed” with technology and shared a story that most parents with young children will know only too well – little ones demanding phones. Speaking about tech, Ronaldo said: “Definitely it helps a lot. It helped me and the people here, all the world, and I think we have to take advantage of that but we shouldn’t be obsessed with it.”  He went on: “My oldest child is going to be  years old soon and he asks me every time, ‘Daddy, can I have a phone, can I have a phone, can I have a phone ’ I say to him, ‘Cristiano, you have time.’” I can’t believe he’s been able to hold out for so long. My six-year-old asks, on an almost daily basis,he can have a phone, insisting all his friends have one. The answer is obviously no – he’s far too young and I know most of his friends don’t own one – but nonetheless it is a source of contention. The few times I’ve given him my smartphone to play games or watch a show on, there’s a full-blown meltdown when it comes to getting it back.  When I think about ­children and gadgets, I often recall the words of Steve Jobs, when he was askedhis kids loved one of his greatest inventions: the iPad.He said: “They haven’t used it. We limit the amount of technology our children use at home.” See, even the great Jobs didn’t let his kids loose on gadgets. Technology is important but it’s far better for kids to be creative, make up their own games and, where possible, play outside. That’s what childhood should be about, not being glued to a screen. So now when my son whines, I have the perfect reply. If it’s good enough for Ronaldo’s son not to have a phone, then it’s good enough for you.

She has made a vocation of educating on dementiaWendy Mitchell has early onset dementia Image: Hull News  PictureByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Feb |commentsThe ducks know Wendy Mitchell, greeting their old friend in a gentle huddle before she even opens her carrier bag of seed. “Because I come every day they remember me,” she says, beaming at the cacophony of quacking, feeding a couple of the birds from her cupped palm. But while the ducks in the village pond know her, Wendy does not know them at least, she can’t remember them, or doing this.She lives with a combination of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, diagnosed in  when she was just .We are at the start of a walk around her village, aptly named Walkington, in East Yorkshire, which she usually repeats two or three times a day. Yet, like the duck feeding, in this moment it is as new for her as it is for me.  These “trundles” give her autonomy, essential to the strict routine she has adopted that helps her continue to live independently . In place of her “memory”, she always slings a camera around her neck, snapping landmarks, birds, animals, treesso when she gets home she can reflect on what she’s done. It sounds like a perpetual Groundhog Day – only for Wendy, it isn’t. Her pedometer has been known to read , steps, but while each might feel familiar, it’s always a first. “Yes, every time, the walk is new,” she nods, brightly. “I don’t remember feeding the ducks yesterday. I know I did, whether it was rainy or sunny I don’t know, orthey came to me straight away like this.  “Once I start up it feels familiar, but every day I’m feeding them for the first time. I never get bored.” When wein an hour, she will admit only knowing she has fed the ducks because her bag is empty. But her fresh eyes, the ability to enjoy things anew, are dementia’s “blessings”, she insists. “I live in the moment. The moment is the only thing we all have for certain. You can learn a lot from people with dementia,” she says.Wendy, , once a super-organised NHS manager with “a photographic memory”, has made a vocation of educating on the disease.Her first book, Somebody I Used to Know, was a bestseller, and her second, What I Wish People Knew About Dementia, written with ghostwriter Anna Wharton, is out now.  As we walkWendy admits she hasn’t always been able to see the positives. Her diagnosis in  was harrowing, and she became depressed. The single mum and her two grown-up daughters knew nothing about dementia. “The process is so negative, it focuses on what you have lost. They say there is nothing you can do and you’re discharged. I was just waiting to die.” Testament to her strength she pulled herself up, mainly for her daughters. Of course she has bad, “foggy” days when she cannot go out, clinging to the sight of her window boxes from bed. This morning wasn’t good. “Every morning I play Scrabble and Solitaire, andI can only make two-letter words, like today, I know it’s a bad morning,” she says.  But so articulate is Wendy, so fiercely independent – she insists her daughters don’t visit every day – it is only the sporadic pauses to find a word that alert me to her dementia. But it affects her in so many ways. Dementia is not just about memory. A surprising fact: she no longer gets hungry or thirsty. She eats and drinks only as a , setting reminders. Her taste has changed too. Her beloved cup of Yorkshire Tea is flavourless to her now. She needs familiarity, so eats the same meal every day for weeks. Currently it’s fish pie.But Wendy struggles to use a kneand fork, and even to see pale food on a white plate.Dementia has played with her eyesight. Anything black, for example, can look like a void.She has hallucinations. “Joyfully” she has seen her late father. And olfactory hallucinations, too. Once a smell of smoke in the house convinced her there was a fire.Her hearing is also affected and loud noises can “physically hurt”.  But as we walk towards the church, she stops when she hears a robin. She can name the birdsong instantly this is an “old memory”. The past is still clear to her, it comes to her in dreams. We pause for  minutes for a picture. Later I remark on how many robin photos she will have. “Have I ” she replies, eagerly. We loop round, today avoiding a field route. Paths she knows will lead back home, in the fields she has become lost. It’s the outline of a row of cottages she clings to, the sound of shrieks in the school playground. Everyone says hello. Wendy replies happily, but explains: “I haven’t a clue who people are.” Worn out, she will need to head home after this to sit in silence, eyes closed. It’s a strange feeling to know she won’t recall me or our walk. “But I will remember the emotion of you,” she assures me. “I will know I met someone with a smiley face.” She now has, she says, only three emotions: happiness, contentment and sadness. She insists she is lucky as others can be left with anger, jealousy. And what about fear  Wendy doesn’t have any of it – “another blessing”, she explains. She once “didn’t like rollercoasters”, but since her dementia, she has been skying. “I’ve now seen an advert for wingwalking,” she adds with a twinkle. She continues: “I can’t say enough how lucky I am. You must never give up on yourself. Don’t underestimate what you can achieve, even at your lowest.” At her front door her sharp eyes spot one final thing. My bag in her porch. It is me that has forgotten it, me who doesn’t have the sharply trained eyes to spot it. Wendy laughs heartily.

Eltiona Skana attacked Emily Jones while she was on her scooter with her dad in Queenaposs Park, Bolton, Greater Manchester, in , when she saw her mother out jogging. The youngster called out to her mum, Sarah Barnes, as she scooted past Skana who was sitting alone at a park bench, armed with a craft kne. Skana, who is originally from Albania and has paranoid schizophrenia, got up and grabbed Emily, cut her throat and then ran off. Today Lady Justice Macur, Mr Justice Sweeney and Mr Justice Morris dismissed an appeal against the sentence by Skana’s barrister Simon Csoka QC. The -year-old admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was given a le sentence with a minimum term of ten years and eight months. The minimum term was increased from eight years last year after the sentencing judge, Mr Justice Wall, admitted he had made an error in calculating the term. Lawyers for Skana had appealed against the sentence, arguing the minimum term was too long and that the judge should only have given her a hospital order. She appeared today over video link at the Royal Courts of Justice with her hair pulled back, wearing a grey t-shirt with a star mot and assisted by a translator. Mr Csoka told the court none of the three psychiatrists who gave evidence at the trial have been told by Skana what she was experiencing during the psychotic episode or why she chose to attack Emily.  He said: “To carry out the act in a busy park on a Sunday is, in itself, evidence of some deluded reality that is playing out entirely in Ms Skana’s mind and then tragically playing out in the real world.” Lady Macur admitted the sentencing judge had a “dficult exercise” but the court accepted his original decisions. She said the judge had “sufficient evidence” to find Skana “knew that what she did was wrong and attempted to escape detection and escape the scene”. She said: “Not only must the judge bear in mind the most chilling aspects and most tragic outcome of the circumstances of the nd March  - but also the dficulties presented by the ability of the defendant suffering from such a mental illness. “We consider that the judge bore in mind all responsibilities to the sentencing exercise that he must conduct and did so in a fashion that is to be commended.  “We accept the sentence was severe but we regard it to be in line with the circumstances of the case as a whole.” She added that the family have faced “trauma and tragedy” following Emily’s death. She said: “We express deepest sympathies for Emily’s loss. Words cannot adequately encompass the grief that her family and friends have been subject to.” Speaking during Skana’s sentencing, Emily’s parents said: Emily was the beat in our hearts, the spring in our step and the reason we got up every morning.  “Emily was our beautul, spirited little girl, a bundle of energy with an infectious personality. “Our future has also been taken away, how can you enjoy le when the biggest part of it isnapost there any more  “We cannot move on, because at this time, we cannot see a future.

The manaposs outfit even had a long tail attached as his disguise was brutally mocked online. His costume also had soft spikes, in addition to the black gloves he wore while allegedly entering the property. According to the politan Nashville Police Department, the suspect broke in on January . But he didn’t zip the onesie up all the way, which allowed a security camera at the property to capture his face.  Doorbell camera video shows the suspect emerging from a car with a bag in his hand. He is also seen wearing a face mask hanging from one ear as he approached the door. A woman walking her dog alerted police to what was going on. She saw the home’s garage door wide open - and the force swung into action.  After alerting the owners, who were away for a few days, they swtly took the footage and launched an appeal. “The residents were out of town,” police said. “Officers were then alerted to the vehicle break-in on Bowling Avenue.” The suspect is described as “a young black man” who is around  feet tall. The policeaposs hunt went viral after they took to social media to try and trace the culprit. Video of the suspect has been viewed thousands of times on Facebook since police made public the CCTV footage of the man outside the property.Users were predictably quick to poke fun at the suspect. One wrote: If I see Barney Iaposll ask his blue brother to get in touch. Another posted: “You can’t make this stuff up.

People working as cashiers in supermarkets and discount shops are often faced with disgruntled customers, and anyone who has worked a retail job knows exactly how tough it is.But thanks to one woman on TikTok, those of us who donapost work in these positions can now see what itaposs like firsthand, as former Wilko employee Holly Laing has dedicated her account to sharing the funniest and most irritating customer interactions sheaposs had while on the clock. Posting on her account @holly_laing, the experienced shop-floor worker revealed her biggest pet peeve when it comes to customers is the number of mistakes they make while paying - and one particular incident saw her running after someone who had walked out before their payment was processed.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Holly revealed the introduction of contactless payments has become a nightmare for cashiers, as people will tap their card and begin walking away before the till has accepted their payment - which can lead to complicated matterstheir card is declined. Acting out the experience in one video, Holly told the fictional customer that their shopping came to £, and the shopper - who was also played by Holly in the sketch - said: Right cheers. Contactless  Thanks. After tapping their card, the customer walked out of the store, leaving Holly to chase after them to get them to come back and try to pay again. She said: Hey sir  Excuse me, sir ! You didnapost pay properly, it didnapost go through. Do you want to just put your card in the machine this time  Hollyaposs videos have also touched on how annoying it is when customers attempt to hand cashiers their card to pay instead of just using the pin-pad themselves, as well as a more recent pet peeve that has arisen since the Covid- pandemic, with people being warier than ever about using cash.The woman explained in another clip that when customers do decide to use cash, they sometimes ask the cashier to put the change directly into their wallet because they donapost want to touch it. Impersonating the customer, Holly said in her video: Oh ... would you mind just putting it back in [my wallet]  I just donapost want to touch it. To which Holly then fumed: Donapost pay with cashyou don’t wanna touch it! Hollyaposs videos have been resonating with her , followers, and many commenters who also work in the service industry shared their own irritating interactions with customers. One person said: The worst thing is when you ask them to insert their card the second time but they tap anyway andit doesn’t work. While another added: Someone sneezed in their hand then used that same hand to give me the money... And someone  posted: I once had to chase after a customer and he went into another shop.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTokViralFunny ha ha viralWilko\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tanisha Clay @tanishaclayyhas spoken on TikTok about having always wanted children, and how one day she decided to allow herself the pleasure of looking at baby clothes before starting her own baby closet - now sheaposs expecting her own little one. The TikToker is encouraging other women who want children one day to do the same, promising nothing will go to waste as any unused items will always get passed onto friends and other expecting mums.  Okay hear me out. If youaposre a girl who wants a baby one day, maybe not today, just one day, just hear me out, because I have a tip that is going to bring you joy and a lot less of a headache later, she told her followers. If you’re the kind of girl whose eyes light up when you walk past the baby section, let me just tell you why you should stop walking and go in. Tanisha asked her followers whether theyaposd ever been to a baby shower and seen the mum-to-be opening present after present of newborn baby clothes, but what happens when the baby is too big to fit in the newborn clothing, she asked. Instead, the mum-to-be came up with her own plan, which she started long before she fell pregnant herself, called the baby closet. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Rule number one is that the item needs to be gender neutral, she explained. Rule number two is thatit’s for a boy I need to be able to pair it with a bow to make it fit a girl. Tanisha went on to say rule number three is that anything she canapost use when she has her own child should be passed on to someone  at a baby shower. There’s actually a fourth rule in that it has to be sized three to  months. No newborn, she added. Tanisha said she always shops baby clothes when theyaposre in the sale, making the exception when she finds something thataposs just too cute to pass up. I do not purposely go looking for baby clothes, I let the baby clothes find me and it has brought me so much joy and anticipation while me and my husband are waiting for the right time to have a baby, she added. The TikToker told her followers about the baby closet back in August last year, however she has since revealed that after a long time trying, she and her husband are now expecting their first baby.

Soon-to-be mum-of-two Ashlee recently celebrated her gender reveal, where family and friends gathered to see her pop a balloon to reveal whether her unborn baby would be a girl or a boy. Ashlee @dinkymisspretty , from the United States, already has a son, so was absolutely overjoyed and overcome with emotion when she popped the balloon and saw pink confetti flying in front of her face, signalling sheaposs having a baby girl - or so she first thought. Posting a clip to her TikTok, Ashlee showed the moment she burst the balloon at her gender reveal, andyou look closely you can see the confetti coming out of the balloon is actually blue, but at that exact moment, her mum decided to shoot a cannon of pink confetti right in her face.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Itaposs hard to understand why any mum would want to play with her own daughteraposs emotions like that, especially when theyaposre pregnant. Ashlee can be seen jumping up and down with joy at seeing the pink confetti, only for her face to turn to thunder when her little boy came over to tell her what her mum had done. Clearly you can see I wanted a girl so bad and in that moment I felt like I hit the lottery, the mum says in the clip, adding: Then here comes my son making me realise its really another boy. I was p***ed. This is the only one I can actually be okay with the parent being mad. Cause why play like that, one follower commented, to which Ashlee responded: Right, I wasnapost mad it was a boy I was mad they had me think it was a girl. Another added: Now see this reaction is valid because you can’t play with a pregnant woman’s emotions like that. I’m sure you’ll have a beautul baby boy though.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

One woman has been left scratching her head over what could be inside a safe she uncovered recently in her new home.A TikTok user named Liz, who posts under @imthefookinlizardking has gone viral online after sharing a clip of her discovery.Posting on the video-sharing app, they explained: I bought a house in November and just found a hidden safe in the floor. The house was built in the late s. How the heck do I open it  She went on to explain that she found the safe while hoovering the carpet, as she noticed little frayed pieces on the floor.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Liz has since messaged several locksmiths and the company that originally made the safe to find outthey could help her open it. Lots of locksmiths told her that they would not mess with a floor safe. More than six million people have since watched the video and are desperate to know whataposs inside the safe. After speaking to numerous people, the TikToker was put in touch with a man named Jim, who is known for being able to crack dficult safe combinations. Liz made an appointment for Jim to come out and take a look at the safe, meanwhile social media users couldnapost help but speculate about what was inside. Some thought there might be a secret tunnel under the floor, while others joked the womanaposs dog looked suspicious like he knew more than what he was letting on. However, everyone was eventually disappointed to learn that the safe was empty. In a finale video on TikTok, Liz showed Jim opening the safe - only to find nothing inside. Tragic. Liz didnapost seem too upset though, knowing that she now had a cool safe under the floor she could use whenever she wanted.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Fitri’s unique obsession further grew when she got married and moved in with her husband. She gradually started collecting yellow items for her dream house. She said: “When I was married, I started buying yellow equipment. Starting from the wallpaper, sheets, carpets, curtains, and custom-made sofas. “Then I bought stickers for the fridge, stove, dispenser so they all turn yellow. Decorative shelves, umbrella holders, umbrellas, scales, flower pots. All yellow.  “I am very happy that Apple released yellow iPhone products on the XR and iPhone  types. Now I use the yellow iPhone . Despite her massive collection at home, Fitri’s obsession for yellow has not ended. She added: “I buy a lot of my collection online, as not many shops stock yellow goods. Although her whole le is painted with the bright colour, Fitri doesn’t wear many yellow clothes. Fitri says she has become a popular name among her social circle for her fixation with yellow. She added: “People around me such as friends, students, family and even acquaintances often say that when they see the yellow item, it immediately reminds them of me. They even send me pictures of cute yellow stuff. “When people visit our house, they are quite surprised and will always compliment for my persistence in making my house yellow. Iaposm quite happy with their reactions.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder..removeThis technique, known

of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car

Ordnance Survey [OS    ] lists the house as “A toll gate at which road dues are collected between Linton and Dunbar.“It is the property of the County road trustees, and is at present occupied by Gilbert Miller.”Thus it can be concluded that East Linton did, indeed, have a turnpike toll-house, probably dating back at least to the mid-th century when the tollbars were set up and the houses constructed along the main turnpike road.Like the other tolls mentioned here, it was a casualty to the railways being constructed, reducing road traffic very considerably and starving the toll-keepers out of existence in late Victorian times.But where is the old toll-house today There is no building on the main road past East Linton in any way resembling a toll-house, and the crossroads where it once stood has long since disappeared after a scheme to construct a bypass outside the village.Computerised super-imposition of a present-day map of East Linton onto Forrest’s  map indicates that the toll-house would be situated close to what is today Lauder Place.And, indeed, a stroll through those parts reveals the existence of the ‘Old Toll House’, accessed through a driveway from Lauder Place.A humble, single-story building just like the other East Lothian toll-houses, it has been signicantly extended at the back.By the present owner, it was identied as the former toll-house by the original deeds, which have since been mislaid.It would today have had a most tranquil situation, far from any of the major roads, had not the mainline railway been just a few feet away, with the trains roaring by with a deafening noise.When its present owner bought the old toll-house  years ago, it was in decent repair, albeit very small and cramped.Curiously, there was then a three foot square stone built room with a small window with iron bars, a prison cell perhaps, intended for people who refused to pay the toll But since the toll-keepers had no powers to imprison people, perhaps it was rather a whisky store, since the toll-keepers often doubled as low-level publicans It is also possible that the magistrates required a convenient holding-cell for local offenders before taking them to a burgh tolbooth.Since the ‘cell’ has long since been removed and the toll-house extensively renovated, with no original features remaining, we will never know.The East Lothian authorities built their toll-houses sturdy and strong, and the Old Toll House in East Linton is likely to stand for centuries to come.Jan Bondeson"},{"url":null,"title":"storm-malik-power-restored-county-clear-up-effort-underway","story":"Households in parts of Dunbar, East Linton, Innerwick and Garvald who were left without power following the storm this weekend have had their supplies restored.SP Energy Networks, which own and operates the electricity transmission and distribution network in south east Scotland, said that power was restored as quickly as possible following the storm.A statement on its Twitter said: \"We’d like to apologise to any of our customers who lost power during the storm and thank you for your patience as we work as quickly, and safely, as we can to clear any debris and reconnect services.\"Extreme weather conditions like gale force winds can make it extremely challenging for our engineering teams to fix issues with the network, especiallyclimbing poles or pylons is required.

close to the time when face coverings no longer need to be worn in the classroom assuming current trends continue, we have not yet reached that stage.“No-one wants young people to have to wear face coverings in the classroom for a moment longer than necessary.“But given the current uncertainty about infection trends in the immediate future, and the relatively high levels of Covid in the younger age groups, continued caution is prudent at this stage.”The new sub-iant - BA. - has been identied and is currently being investigated.The First Minister has said that BA. is \"not a cause for any alarm\" and there is no need to make any change to the current measures at the moment.There has been a total of  cases of the BA. sub-iant of Omicron have been confirmed in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said, though this number is likely to be an underestimate.The First Minister told MSPs: “Genomic sequencing is being used to investigate this further.“So far, I can confirm that in Scotland,  cases of BA. have been confirmed through genomic sequencing but we expect this number to increase as more sequencing results are reported.“And given that not all tests are genomically sequenced, it will be an underestimate of the presence of this sub-iant here.”She said there was no evidence that BA. led to more serious illness or had a greater chance of escaping immunity, however it appeared to be able to “out-run” Omicron.Flu vaccinations have now resumed for vulnerable groups. You should visit the NHS inform website to arrange to get your flu jab. Ms Sturgeon urged those who are eligible for their booster jab to get their vaccine. From February , vaccinated travellers, who are fully vaccinated or under , will no longer need to take a pre-departure Covid test and they will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival until theyve received a negative result.Travellers in this group will still need to take a test on or before day  after arriving in the UK - which can be a lateral flow device rather than a PCR test from Sunday.Anyone who tests positive on their lateral flow test will need to isolate and take a free confirmatory PCR test.The new measures apply across the UK after an agreement between the UK Government and the three devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon warned last week that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. See the full guidance via the Scottish Government website.Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people

Since , Rois, , has been creating unique pieces of jewellery from the sea glass she finds on Scotland’s coasts.“I’d noticed someone making shell and sea glass jewellery in Hawaii years ago, and I’d never seen it used that way before,” she says.“I started to look around beaches in Scotland and found we had our own sea glass. Then I noticed how dferent shores have produce dferent types of sea glass – the colours, types of bottles and textures were unique to the conditions of the that particular coastline.”Rois Clark Rois, who is based in Glasgow, admits the main source of satisfaction from her work derives from creating meaningful jewellery from broken pieces of old discarded glass.“My background is in Student Ministry,” she comments, “mostly working with younger vulnerable women.“I find it quite a prayerful practice making treasure out of the broken pieces – the action for me is a symbol of hope. We’ve all had our own tumultuous journey, and many vulnerable people can feel a little broken themselves, but when handled with care and attention things can change.”Rois collects her sea glass from over  beaches all over Scotland, gathering samples of ying shapes, colours, and textures. Each piece of jewellery is handpicked, handmade and comes with a map stating where it was found.She says: “I’d say  per cent of people who select my products choose it for the location aspect. A lot of the time people share a story about why that location means so much to them.”www.roisseaglass IONA TURNER ARTISTSince graduating from Glasgow School of Art last June, artist Iona Turner has impressed many with her original jewellery made from seaweed foraged from Scotland’s beaches.Growing up in Edinburgh, Iona chose  to spend a lot of her time by the sea and since the age of  she has been a seasonal surf instructor in East Lothian.Iona Turner “I began working with the materials that I was foraging there after developing a desire to make something using the natural surroundings,” she says.“I came to seaweed through foraging it for food, that’s how I got a bit more familiar with its materiality.“The process I have is low-impact and a sensitive approach to the seaweed – I don’t meddle too much with it before making my pieces.”Iona forages for seaweed that’s been ripped up by natural processes, such as after a storm or a big swell. The storm-cast knotted-wrack seaweed is used to make her bold statement pieces of jewellery.She says: “I really like that I get to collect the material myself and source it from places that I love. I also love working with a material where there is no waste from it – any discards are made into compost. And what I really enjoy most about the seaweed is that I get to be the supply chain.“I think my buyers are drawn to my pieces because of the sense of the closeness to nature and the fact that they are buying something that doesn’t have the same consumer guilt that other products can have. Just having that connection to a coastal place is also a big draw.”www.instagram iona.maker"},{"url":null,"title":"ali-price-insists-finn-russell-not-maverick-lifts-lid-scotland-team-mate","story":"However, the player who almost certainly knows and understands the Scottish stand-off best believes that this categorisation doesn’t give adequate credit to Russell’s vision and rugby intelligence. Ali Price and Russell were team-mates at Glasgow Warriors for five seasons at the start of their professional careers, they have played half-back together for Scotland  times, and both toured South Africa with the Lions last summer when they featured in the final Test. They shared a flat in Glasgow before Russell’s move to Racing  in the summer of  and remain close. “I wouldn’t say he’s a maverick – I would say he reads the game dferently to pretty much any other  in the world,” said Price earlier this week, as he looked ahead to Scotland kicking off their  Six Nations campaign with an eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup clash against England on Saturday. Price and Russell will almost certainly be named as Nos  and  in Gregor Townsend’s team when it is announced at lunchtime today. “The space he sees and the skillset he has that enables him to pull off certain moves – the chips, the long balls, the passes – makes him unique,” Price continued.  “It’s just him. He’s a world-class . For me, my job is to try and help facilitate that as much as I can.  “He’s always looking for space. We’ve got a good relationship where we know what each other is thinking most of the time, which obviously helps.” When Price first broke into the Scotland team back in , there was concern in some quarters that he was too much of a free-spirit to play alongside Russell – but the -year-old has matured into an important leader of the side. That earned him his call-up to last summer’s Lions tour, and he believes the trip took his game to the next level.  Now he is determined to use his Lions experience to help Scotland make the leap from plucky underdogs capable of one-off victories against the top teams into genuine contenders for the Six Nations title. “You can pick up on things here and there, maybe little comments that players from other nations may have made while we were in South Africa about how they approach certain aspects of a game,” he explained. “That could be quite valuable – but that works both ways in terms of the opposition maybe knowing what some of us Scottish players could be thinking at certain moments.” The key to success in the Six Nations is no secret: it is a sprint rather than a marathon, so it is essential to start fast and then accelerate. With that in mind, Price believes Scotland can learn from last year’s campaign when they finished fourth in the table despite famous wins in London and Paris. “We had that great win at Twickenham, which was the first in  odd years, and we were in a great position the following week against Wales in terms of score-line, but they got it by a point come the end,” he said. “Ireland, again, was a three-point game. So, its just about putting it all together now. “Getting victories on the board in week one and week two puts you in a good position on the table, so thats what we will be trying to do,” he continued. “Thats what were doing in training now fine tuning and getting ourselves right for the first game because you cant look past the first game, its massive.  “If you get four or five wins then youre knocking at the door on that last weekend to see where you finish up. Hopefully  we can put it all together by drawing on the experiences from last year and the year before, then we should be in a good place come the last weekend.  “From an inidual and team point of view, having the confidence and the belief that we can beat these teams comes from the fact that we have beaten these teams. “The belief is certainly there thatwe can go out and implement how we want to play and our game-plan then we have the players, the ability and the skill level to come away with victories. “I dont know whether its arrogance, but its definitely a belief, a confidence. “Theres depth in every position now, which maybe has been lacking at times in the past, so there are no excuses because weve got it all there, weve got the training facilities, weve got everything in place for us to perform.  “Theres a lot of guys in good form who are looking to go out there and enjoy it and hopefully get off to the best start possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"letter-written-mary-queen-scots-sells-32-500-auction","story":"Auction house Lyon and Turnbull said there was international interest in the document, signed with a message in French, as it went under the hammer live and online on Wednesday.The letter is an appeal from Mary Queen of Scots to the French ambassador in England to allow the safe passage of Scottish nobleman, George Douglas, to France.It was written in Carlisle Castle two months after her escape from Lochleven Castle in Perthshire on May  , where she had been imprisoned for nearly a year following a forced abdication in favour of her infant son, James VI.Mary hoped that by helping to ensure a safe journey to France for George Douglas, he would intercede with the French king on her behalf to help secure her freedom.Cathy Marsden, rare books, manuscripts and maps specialist at Lyon  Turnbull, which has its headquarters in Edinburgh, said: “There was international interest in this letter, the sum achieved at auction reflecting the enduring fascination with one of the best known monarchs in history.“There are  lines written by a secretary, and an additional six lines in Mary’s own hand.

and bodies do a good job of explaining it so Scottish households don’t get caught out.\"The legislation, which came about as a result of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in , were expected to come into

privately-rented homes have been required to have interlinked smoke alarms for more than a decade.Concerns have been raised about the availability of interlinked alarms and the number of households still to undertake the work.The new rules apply to owner-occupied homes and those in the social rented sector, placing a legal duty on councils to monitor how many homes are compliant.Scottish Labour had called for the introduction of the new standards to be delayed, citing supply chain problems with the new alarms.Ms Robison said she hoped that at an expected average cost of around £ \"and often less\", fire alarm standards will be viewed as part of ongoing improvements for people who own their homes.The delays came after the Herald revealed concern in October, , that new Scottish Government legislation made it a legal requirement for all homes to have interlinked smoke and carbon monoxide alarms in four months.The row over the timetable erupted after leaflets from companies began circulating warning of the February  deadline and leading to fears that they would cash in on panic-buying.Private companies had been known to quote up to £ to fit a system of alarms.Under the terms Scottish homeowners had to have a ceiling-mounted smoke alarm in their living room, hallways and landings and a heat alarm in every kitchen.The alarm system must be interlinked.And carbon monoxide

immune-evasive iants that emerge, while it also sheds light on why some iniduals may get infected over and over.As of January , .% of positive PCR test resultswere determined to be re-infections but the rate climbed to almost % earlier in the month.The highest numbers have been reported amongst people aged  to , with more females affected \"likely due to higher rates of routine occupational

is distinguishing between viral persistence and true re-infection.In Scotland, they are defined as a positive result  days or more after a previous test. Professor Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh said repeat infections are likely to be due to exposure risk and \"inherent likelihood of becoming infected, once exposed.\"He said: “The additional data on reinfections will be useful information, particularly at this time, when it is likely that re-infections will be occurring with increasing frequency and therefore the rate of new infections occurring decreasingly representative of the true course of the epidemic.\"If there are high numbers of reinfections then this will be due to a combination of the sheer number of people already infected, and the fact that, as immunity wanes, the likelihood is that protection is also waning.\"Thus having an estimate of the rate of re-infectionwill help to determine how quickly immunity is waning across the country and therefore crucially, when further boosters may need to be considered. : Lockdown for Tonga after Covid- infections reach disaster-hit nation\"We need to know these things in order to better target

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

These investments in clean energy will help grow the green economy and reduce Northern Ireland’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.”The Academy will be driven by a public-private partnership that includes Northern Regional College, Belfast politan College, Queen’s University Belfast, Ulster University and the University of Birmingham.A consortium of key industry players also involved includes Wrightbus, Energia, Translink, Firmus, and EP UK Investments.Speaking at the launch, Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Councillor William McCaughey said: “The announcement of this revolutionary Hydrogen Training Academy is welcome and timely, particularly as we heighten our focus on creating and sustaining long term economic recovery and growth in the aftermath of a global pandemic.“Mid and East Antrim is uniquely placed in Northern Ireland in terms of the key strengths and assets we boast in energy and cleantech that align with the ambition of net zero carbon targets. The Academy will support the development of the Ballymena area as a ‘hydrogen hub’ and continue to build upon our Borough’s reputation as a centre of excellence and the main focal point of the emerging Northern Ireland wide hydrogen economy.“I commend Council’s Elected Members and officers who, in collaboration with our public and private sector partners, have invested a huge amount of time and effort in bringing the project to this stage. I very much look forward to seeing the Academy grow and to witnessing the longer-term economic impact it will undoubtedly have in the coming years.“Today’s announcement along with future plans for investment in the iC Innovation and Cleantech Centre at St. Patrick’s Barracks and the recent announcement of pound million joint funding with QUB under the Northern Ireland Executive’s City and Growth Deals Complementary Fund for a Ballymena Integrated Green Hydrogen Hub further supports and cements our ambition.”Ian Luney, Commercial Director at EP UK Investments, said: “EPUKI is delighted to support Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, alongside other partners across the public and private sectors, in the development of the Hydrogen Training Academy in Ballymena. As the owners of Kilroot and Ballylumford Power Stations, we recognise the value of supporting innovation and training, particularly in emerging cleantech industries such as the hydrogen sector.“The production and use of hydrogen is part of our long-term vision for the Kilroot Energy Park. Upskilling existing and new employees through the academy will be crucial in enabling Northern Ireland to benefit from opportunities in a thriving hydrogen economy over the coming years and EPUKI look forward to contributing to that.”The launch of the Academy comes as Mid and East Antrim Borough Council welcomes the arrival of a new state-of-the-art training pod for the first cohort of trainees to use.Based at Silverwood Business Park, the H Gas Safe Lab is the first of two facilities for the Ballymena area and is targeted at the NI Gas Safe Register plumbing and heating industry to provide a competence testing space for work with commercial level equipment.The state-of-the-art facility is the first mixed-gas hydrogen-testing lab in the UK for Gas Safe engineers, with multiple systems to help reduce carbon footprints in houses and offices.Northern Regional College will house the second training facility focusing on the production of hydrogen through specialist training equipment. This facility will provide a technology familiarisation teaching space for all levels in the basics of green hydrogen.Graham Whitehurst MBE, Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force, explained how the Hydrogen Training Academy will play a “critical role” in training and upskilling existing employees as well as new trainees to a recognised professional competence standard required for the hydrogen sector.“Through the Hydrogen Training Academy and a range of other initiatives, led by our Manufacturing Task Force, Mid and East Antrim is cementing its position as a hub for SME innovation and commercialisation activity and a springboard for the future of the cleantech growth sector and industry.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4419803.jpg--.jpg?1643793308000\n","title":"new moderator was brought up in ballymena","story":" A minister who grew up in Ballymena from infancy is to be the next Moderator of the Presbyterian Church. Rev John Kirkpatrick will be known as the Moderator-Designate until the Church’s General Assembly in June, when he will formally succeed the current Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce. A son and grandson ‘of the Manse’ – he was one of four nominees that the all-Ireland denomination had to choose from this year, which traditionally elects its Moderator-Designate on the first Tuesday in February.Alongside Mr Kirkpatrick, this year’s nominees were Rev Dr Colin McClure, minister of First Larne Presbyterian Church, Rev Dr Trevor McCormick, minister of Frist Kilrea and Boveedy Presbyterian Churches and Rev Alastair McNeely, minister of Richhill Presbyterian Church. Each received the following votes: middot Rev John Kirkpatrick  votes: The Presbyteries of Ballymena, North Belfast, South Belfast, East Belfast, Dromore, Dublin  Munster, Iveagh, Omagh, Templepatrick and Tyronemiddot Rev Dr Colin McClure  vote: The Presbytery of Carrickfergusmiddot Rev Dr Trevor McCormick  votes: The Presbyteries of Coleraine  Limavady, Newry, and Routemiddot Rev Alastair McNeely  votes: The Presbyteries of Ards, Armagh, Derry  Donegal, Down, Monaghan.Having received the most votes from the Church’s  presbyteries, Mr Kirkpatrick will be the denomination’s th Moderator since  and its first from Portrush Presbyterian Church.Speaking about his election, the -year-old North Coast minister said, “I am genuinely surprised by what has happened, but very excited at the prospect of the story God is going to write from June and the months that follow. As I continue to serve the Lord Jesus in this new role, I am looking forward to coming alongside our churches at this critical time, encouraging them as we move forward from Covid. I also look forward to building good relationships wherever possible, honouring Jesus and representing our Church across the island and further afield.”Born in in Limavady, Mr Kirkpatrick was brought up from the age of three in Ballymena. A third generation Presbyterian minister – his father had been minister of Balteagh Presbyterian, near Limavady, while his grandfather had also served in congregations in Counties Donegal, Tyrone and Antrim.Mr Kirkpatrick has been minister of Portrush Presbyterian for nearly  years, having served in the holiday town since . Prior to that, he spent nearly six years in Garryduff Presbyterian near Ballymoney, his first congregation. He was ordained in  as an assistant minister in Megain Memorial and Mersey Presbyterian Churches in East Belfast. When he became minister in Portrush, he also represented PCI in its partner relationships in Central and Eastern Europe until .Having attended Ballymena County Primary School and Coleraine Academical Institution, he went on to study farm management at Greenmount Agricultural College from -, with an agri career in mind. This led to three years of study at the University of Ulster’s, Coleraine campus, where in  he gained a BSc in Social Science and Environmental Studies. After spending a year working for the Department of Agriculture, in  he attended Belfast Bible College before starting his studies at Union Theological College for the ordained ministry of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the same year.Talking about his faith, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “With a father and a grandfather as Presbyterian ministers, you might say that I am not only ‘a son of the Manse’, but ‘a grandson of the Manse’ as well. While I came to a personal faith in Jesus at the age of nine, there was never an expectation that I would follow in their footsteps. But God, obviously, had other plans and I genuinely give thanks for the near  years I have spent in the ordained ministry.”Today he ministers to a congregation of around  families in and around the seaside town, which grows considerably during the summer months and at Easter. “I would describe myself as a ‘preaching pastor’, as I see the linked importance of preaching and teaching the Bible, coupled with pastoral care being the complimentary need to this.“The issues that we face at Portrush Presbyterian Church, or ‘PPC’, are set against the context of the st century, a secular society, but a hungry society. In my time in PPC we have reflected the wider cultural trends, which I am glad to say have been away from ‘nominalism’ and traditional church attendance, to a more committed church community living in a community where outwardly church is less important, but certainly not without value.“Primarily we love to share the Good News in all ways we can, but we know we must earn trust and respect. In this, we see the location of PPC as critical to a very wide community of visitors and friends, helped by street gospel distributions and other opportunities as cultural moments in the town provide s for evangelism. As Moderator, I want to translate the le and experience of ministry in Portrush, both church and community, to a bigger canvas, but with the same vision and pattern,” he said.Mr Kirkpatrick also explained that building relationships with the community, and serving the community, were both important. “We see our presence as a gospel one, building relationships with all where we can people and organisations are part of this involvement from our local schools, to the PPC’s shop in the town that connects with community in a dferent way and funds ious community projects. We also encourage our members to be active in the community in ious ways through the RNLI and REACH, for example, a community project which took on a greater signicance due to Covid.”With regards to the pandemic, he said that while the lockdown was dficult for so many dferent reasons, it also created an opportunity to try new things. “We did recorded services and streaming services. I did a daily devotional called ‘Side-by-Side’ and a video reading of several appropriate books such as ‘The hiding place’ by Corrie ten Boom, ‘To a dferent drum’ by Pauline Hamilton, and Elizabeth Kuhn’s, ‘Green leaf in drought’ as I wanted to encourage our people in their isolation.”Married to Joan for  years this summer, a palliative care nurse, they have four children and five grandchildren. “Thursday was baking day in our home during the lockdown when Joan baked. The following day I was able to deliver to folk as part of my rounds, giving me a chance to listen to them and pray for them on the doorstep, or in their garden. We’ve made every effort to be in church and have le back when we were given the chance. Thankfully we have a big building, which has meant we could welcome everyone back safely.”Thinking about his forthcoming year in office, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “For everyone, the last two years have seen all aspects of le, and Church le with it, turned upside down and the story still isn’t over yet. As time moves on, I hope and pray that we will be able to process the many painful memories that it has left behind. I appreciate that this will not be an easy, or a straightforward journey for everyone, as our stories are all dferent.“With this in mind, as Moderator, I look forward to visiting congregations, ministers and their families, seeing what they have been through, how they have coped, and ministering into that. Stepping into my predecessor’s shoes after two years will not be easy, and I pay tribute to Dr Bruce as he has led the Church through this time of national and global crisis. Whatever the year may hold, I am thankful to God, that I won’t be undertaking it alone, and certainly not in my own strength, for Jesus will be with me!”When Mr Kirkpatrick is not in the pulpit, or visiting members of his congregation, he says that he enjoys walking, reading, watching films and listening to an eclectic mix of music. His more active pursuits include a love of motorcycle sport, motocross and motorcycle racing. Since , he has been Race Chaplain to the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland. He also enjoys gardening and bee keeping.

The former DUP leader said he had taken legal advice which meant he could order the checks to stop without the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive. His party are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had been agreed by the EU and the UK in order to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. However, unionists, who believe the arrangements are damaging to Northern Ireland’s position within the UK, have been critical. Currently, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Irelands ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and should not continue without the Executive’s approval. Today, Mr Poots said legal advice he had received confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitarychecks required approval from the Stormont Executive. This meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and that at a result a formal instruction had been issued to DAERA’ss permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on December ,  as of midnight tonight.

It is unrealistic and can only be met by cutting livestock numbers on local farms, and even by doing that, it would still not solve climate change,” Mr Chestnutt continued.Instead, it will export our food production overseas to meet consumer demand for meat and dairy products, where emissions are higher and standards are lower.”After a y Assembly debate, the vote for the net zero target, which passed by  to , came during the latest stage of a bill to tackle climate change.It was supported by the Greens, Sinn Fein, SDLP and Alliance but Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots argued instead for a target of reducing emissions by % by .He accused other parties of ganging up on rural communities after the vote passed, with the DUP and UUP opposing the plan.Mr Poots said he is going to attempt to make further amendments to the bill which will mitigate the impact on the agricultural sector - and potentially leave them out of the net zero target altogether.The % figure is being passed as a headline but may not be fulfilled, Mr Poots added. The consequences are hugely damaging, he said. I have to find a means of undoing the damage.Ms Bailey believes the agriculture sector should not be left out of any net zero targets.Speaking on BBC’s Good Morning Ulster radio show, Ms Bailey said: The agriculture sector is our highest emitter. We know that farmers want to do better. In Northern Ireland, despite being a small region and a small population we actually emit double our per capita in terms of emissions - more than China.“Every single job that is linked to farming in some way will be impacted, as well as jobs in rural areas that depend on business from agri-food workers. Jobs are needed to sustain rural communities,” added Mr Chestnutt. He noted that farmers lobbied MLAs and commissioned KPMG “to conduct the economic impact assessment on the far-reaching consequence of the Private Member’s Billon agriculture and rural communities”.The UFU urged MLAs “to think again when this Bill comes back to the Assembly for further consideration at the next stage and for the many that supported the net zero target but made a commitment to us that they would ensure nothing would be done that would harm agriculture or reduce livestock numbers, to deliver on their promise!”Most ReadPervert Davy Tweed at centre of alleged buried baby probe after wooden cross foundHalt to post-Brexit NI Protocol checks ‘matter for Executive’ as Brandon Lewis confirms UK won’t interveneFire at former Game of Thrones set in Northern Ireland ‘controlled burning’, confirms fire serviceCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewTeenagerwho raped his girlfriendavoids prison sentenceTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsPlayLook inside Northern Ireland#s Game of Thrones Studio TourPlayCCTV: Gunman flees Belfast Danny McClean murder scene in fresh police appeal footageLatest Northern IrelandUK Government will not intervene in DUP order to halt Brexit checksHalting Brexit checks would be a breach of international law, warns CoveneyNorthern Ireland Protocol is the law and must be adhered to, says Sinn FeinKey questions over move to halt Brexit checks in Northern IrelandLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasLatestNorthern Ireland business leaders slam ‘risk-averse public sector’s fear of ending up on Stephen Nolan show’Ashley Giles leaves England role with future of Chris Silverwood still uncertainJudge’s ‘caveman’ son admits charges over US Capitol riotUK Government will not intervene in DUP order to halt Brexit checksNasser Hussain sympathises with Ashley Giles but says departure to be expected,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports.

Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in .

The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success.

Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them.

It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13437254.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is the dference we have to pay.”Mr Larkin told MLAs that, at the time of the October monitoring round, NI Water was facing a shortfall of £. million in its annual budget.He said the company was given an allocation of £. million in the monitoring round and then received further additional funding of £. million from the budget of the Department for Infrastructure.He added that NI Water generated savings of £. million and was given emergency funding of £. million in January by the Department of Finance.It then received an additional £ million in the monitoring round on January  to cover the period to the end of the current financial year.He said: “We tend to look at Northern Ireland Water as a public health facility here in Northern Ireland, it is government-owned and it is very dficult to continue to operate it on a piecemeal basis, particularly as funding looks like it might not cover the issues.“That is one of the things we have to look at, are the funding arrangements around Northern Ireland Water fit for purpose today “Are they able to underpin what is a public health utility ”Ms Venning: “It is very clear that we are in a period of upward inflation and that energy price increases are very signicant in terms of overall budgets.“That means there is a need for additional resource and these increases are inescapable.“That does bring conflicts when bids for additional funding are not met. Starving the business of investment leads to service disruption and service degradation.“Our experience between the October and January monitoring round was a stark example of that.”Committee vice chairman David Hilditch asked about the accuracy of information the committee had received before Christmas, that schools and hospitals would have to close unless additional funding was supplied to cover the NI Water shortfall in the financial year.Ms Venning said: “We prepared a consequence document and,you recall the gap between the October monitoring rounds was in the region of £ million.“The question that was put to us was what would happenyou don’t get the £ million and you must live within the RDELbudget “We examined our costs and set out a series of consequences. It was all around wastewater. We said we would prioritise drinking water.“It was a ridiculous exercise because the amount of money that was short, we would have had to shut down the entire wastewater part of our business and even then we wouldn’t have saved the full amount of money.“In shutting down the entire wastewater part of our business, that waste is flowing in pipes, there are no pumps to pump it on, it would have escaped.“Of course schools would have had to have closed,they can’t flush their toilets, and they can’t remove waste and they have no hygiene facilities.“It is hard to imagine any part of society that doesn’t have an impact.”UUP MLA Roy Beggs said: “Essentially you have been operating on fumes.“There was a bid in for October monitoring, which I understand was not successful.“You were potentially going bust. The Department for Infrastructure scrambled around to find what they could find, yourselves did the same.NI WaterDepartment for InfrastructureNorthern IrelandMLAsRoy Beggs  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularVeterans demand apology from Colum Eastwood over Bloody Sunday claimsGroundhog Day : What is Groundhog Day, meaning behind US holiday explained - and who is Punxsutawney PhilRuth Dudley Edwards: It’s official – I am now a unionist!One IRA bomb, two dead toddlers, two dead adults, one wrecked crime lab, and  years of justice deniedMurdered mum’s body was found with her young son by her side patting her shoulderMost Popular of the best duvets for winter UK: how to chose, synthetic, down or wool fill, and what tog to keep cosy Charlotte Tilbury Beautul Skin Foundation: we review the new product launch - which foundation suits you Aldi outdoor log burner review: how much are Gardenline burners - size, weight, colour and features best women’s running shoes  UK: running trainers for women from Asics, On Cloud, Merrell, Hoka Best baby prams UK : we review travel systems and pushchairs, from Cybex, Mamas  Papas, and Silver Cross                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeGiven that Warner Bros are involved and the studio has been given ‘official’ status I never thought it was going to be, but when you’ve spent the last few miles of the journey travelling behind a tractor it’s hard to conjure images akin to Disneyland.I came on the tour as someone who wouldn’t describe themselves as a fan of ‘Game of Thrones’, but somehow have managed to see almost every episode thanks to my we.I left completely blown away by what was on offer, which is why I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in TV and film, and not just GoT fans.Being able to get so close to the costumes and props gives you an appreciation of the painstaking detail that goes into making it. Focus is also given to what goes into building the sets, mapping the story, making the prosthetics, and generating CGI footage, and there’s plenty of interactive sections and photo ops.Visitors will easily become immersed on a tour that takes at least  minutes to savour.Although the show itself is known for its violent scenes, the good news for families is the tour is suitable for children aged five and up.Adult tickets cost £. and childrencost £..

Rev Kirpatrick related how he had actually been ready to retire this year but believed God directly guided him to take up the role of moderator.Pressed on declining church membership in a secular age, he said that he welcomed the process in that it reduced nominal membership and pressed those inside and outside the church to think carefully about their beliefs.He also related how Presbyterian membership in large parts of the Republic of Ireland is increasing. This he put down to “open” and “developing” churches adopting new formats to reduce barriers, community, a growing interest from people with “no faith”, a focus on hospitality and more emphasis on Jesus Christ as opposed to Presbyterianism.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe move was announced as the Conservative administration at Westminster prepared to publish its Levelling Up white paper.Prime minister Boris Johnson, who has come under fire as a result of the “partygate” allegations, will attempt to ert attention from the ongoing saga by insisting the “defining mission” of his government is to “level up” the country so people have “access to the same opportunities” regardless of where in the UK they live.Levelling up secretary Michael Gove is to invite Wales first minister Mark Drakeford, as well as his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon, and Paul Givan and Michelle O’Neill from Northern Ireland, to take part in the project, calling for the four nations to work together in the same way as they did in the Covid vaccine roll out.In addition, the Glasgow city region is to be one of three new Innovation Accelerator areas, and will receive a share of £ million of UK Government funding in a bid to encourage innovation and research and development work and boost local opportunities.Speaking ahead of the launch of the White Paper, the prime minister said: “From day one, the defining mission of this government has been to level up this country, to break the link between geography and destiny so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities.”He added: “The challenges we face have been embedded over generations and cannot be dug out overnight, but this White Paper is the next crucial step.“It is a vision for the future that will see public spending on RD increased in every part of the country, transport connectivity improving, faster broadband in every community, le expectancies rising, violent crime falling, schools improving and private sector investment being unleashed.”.removeThe prime minister declared: “It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK.”Mr Gove meanwhile described the UK as an “unparalleled success story with one of the world’s biggest and most dynamic economies”.However he stated: “Not everyone shares equally in the UK’s success. Great cities like Glasgow, Belfast, Swansea and Manchester, and proud towns from Aberystwyth to Armagh, to Bangor and Yeovil, have huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back.“Our ambitious plan to unite and level up the whole UK seeks to end that historic injustice and call time on the postcode lottery.”But he added: “We will only succeedall layers of government – UK, devolved, and local – work together.“We have seen through the success of the vaccine roll-out what we can achieve when we pull together.

The worlds only official Game of Thrones studio tour will open to the public on Friday, February . Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeGiven that Warner Bros are involved and the studio has been given ‘official’ status I never thought it was going to be, but when you’ve spent the last few miles of the journey travelling behind a tractor it’s hard to conjure images akin to Disneyland.I came on the tour as someone who wouldn’t describe themselves as a fan of ‘Game of Thrones’, but somehow have managed to see almost every episode thanks to my we.I left completely blown away by what was on offer, which is why I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in TV and film, and not just GoT fans.Being able to get so close to the costumes and props gives you an appreciation of the painstaking detail that goes into making it. Focus is also given to what goes into building the sets, mapping the story, making the prosthetics, and generating CGI footage, and there’s plenty of interactive sections and photo ops.Visitors will easily become immersed on a tour that takes at least  minutes to savour.Although the show itself is known for its violent scenes, the good news for families is the tour is suitable for children aged five and up.Adult tickets cost £. and childrencost £.. Students, senior and family tickets are also available.Find out more at www.gameofthronesstudiotour——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “The Utility Regulator forewarned us that energy price rises of this nature will continue because of exceptionally high global wholesale gas prices, however it is never good news for consumers when prices go up. This is going to put extreme pressure on many households as they try to pay their gas bills. “With the cost of energy continuing to increase, the Consumer Council is concerned about a potential rise in fuel poverty as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “We welcome firmus energy’s commitment to assist some of our most vulnerable consumers through support for the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, but it is clear that energy companies including firmus, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high fuel prices will be with us for years.” Consumers who are struggling with their energy bills or topping up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

The former DUP leader said he had taken legal advice which meant he could order the checks to stop without the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive. His party are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had been agreed by the EU and the UK in order to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. However, unionists, who believe the arrangements are damaging to Northern Ireland’s position within the UK, have been critical. Currently, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Irelands ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and should not continue without the Executive’s approval. Today, Mr Poots said legal advice he had received confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitarychecks required approval from the Stormont Executive. This meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and that at a result a formal instruction had been issued to DAERA’ss permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on December ,  as of midnight tonight.
