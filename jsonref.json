If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Battenberg cake set comeback year coincide Queens 70 years throne","story":"Share this article A food industry expert said last night: \u0027There is a certain irony that the Battenberg is going to enjoy a resurgence in popularity during the Jubilee year.

The couple were also accused of taunting their children with pies and other food that they were forbidden to eat.  The Turpin parents chowed down on fast food in front of them, chaining the children to filthy beds if they tried to steal food. \u0027They still can\u0027t look at peanut butter or bologna,\u0027 Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham told People magazine last year.\u0027I made the mistake of mentioning peanut butter during one of our meet-and-greets, and one of the girls almost threw up. And when they\u0027re at the grocery store, they can\u0027t look at peanut butter. They can\u0027t even go down the aisle where there\u0027s peanut butter.\u0027The Turpin offspring weren\u0027t allowed to play like normal children and were deprived of things other kids had, including toys and games. Sawyer also spoke with Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin, who was involved with the case. He says it is one he will never forget.\u0027It stopped me dead in my tracks,\u0027 he said. \u0027There are cases that stick with you, that haunt you.\u0027 David and Louise pleaded guilty to 14 counts of torture and other abuse in 2019 and were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. They are both eligible for parole in 22 years.The 13 siblings remained out of the public eye as their parents\u0027 case unfolded in court and they learned to adapt to normal life outside the confines of the house of horrors. Beecham, who prosecuted the Turpin case, told People magazine that all of the siblings \u0027are happy.\u0027\u0027They are moving on with their lives,\u0027 he added.At that time, one sibling had graduated college, while several others had jobs or were going to school. \u0027Some of them are living independently, living in their own apartment, and have jobs and are going to school. Some volunteer in the community. They go to church,\u0027 he shared. He also noted that the siblings see each other regularly.  \u0027They still meet with each other, all 13 of them, so they\u0027ll meet somewhere kind of discreet,\u0027 he said. Several of the siblings have changed their names to rid themselves of the stigma of being a victim in the high-profile case. \u0027It would be difficult for them to carry that name, that label of being a victim, forever,\u0027 Beecham said. In 2019, Louise\u0027s sister Elizabeth Flores told Radar Online that Louise cried when they discussed the children but \u0027didn\u0027t want to admit to anything\u0027 and is in \u0027denial.\u0027\u0027We talked about the baby.

The injured Leah Williamson is replaced in defence by Jen Beattie.United start the game in fifth, with 12 points from seven games, but you should see their xG! Seriously, though - because sometimes the laughter has to stop - they have played a bit better than those bald statistics would suggest. They lost leads in their last three WSL games, draws against City, Spurs and Everton. Had they won two of those they would be in the cherished, Champions League qualification-ensuring third place. Arsenal have finished third in six of the last seven WSL seasons - but they have precisely 0.00 per cent interest in making it seven out of eight. The title - which they have won only once in the WSL era - is a realistic ambition this year. They could barely have had a better start under their new manager, Jonas Eidevall: six straight wins followed by a dramatic 1-1 draw at Spurs last weekend.  This is another tough game for Arsenal, but they need three points to stay ahead of Chelsea, who will almost certainly beat struggling Birmingham this afternoon. The pace of the WSL title race is so unforgiving that any dropped points could be costly - today and, more importantly, when the engravers get to work in May.

Non-Covid care continues to be severely impacted,” Dr Holohan said in a statement.“We are all, understandably, very tired of this pandemic,” he said.“Time and again we have asked the Irish people to take on board public health messaging and act for the collective good. And time and again the vast majority have listened to that message and responded.”Dr Holohan’s latest statement comes as the country, and most of Europe, continues to grapple with a fourth wave of the virus. A further 5,959 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Saturday and there were 640 patient’s hospitalised, of whom 121 were in intensive care. Dr Holohan said: “At high levels of transmission, we are very vulnerable to sudden, unsustainable surges of infection, such as we are seeing at the moment. It is for this reason that we must now ask people to continue to heed public health messages. We know that this call is more difficult to respond to now than at any time previously.”Dr Holohan has advised that members of the public prioritise who they meet with in person, work from home where possible and avail of testing if they are showing symptoms of Covid-19.On testing, Dr Holohan said antigen tests should only be used if a person does not have symptoms and as a “further additional tool”.On Saturday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin moved to down play reports of conflict between the Government and Dr Holohan, over the provision of subsidised antigen tests to the general public.Mr Martin said on Saturday that Dr Holohan supported the use of antigen testing in targeted areas but that he was concerned that there should be clear communication about how and when they should be used.It was reported on Saturday that Dr Holohan had written to the Government, urging it not to provide subsidised antigen tests after the Cabinet had decided to proceed with the plan. Dr Holohan has criticised antigen tests in the past, saying they could be misused and give a false sense of security. DemonstrationsThousands of people took part in multiple demonstrations against Covid-19 restrictions and vaccines in different cities in Europe on Saturday.Belfast saw hundreds gathering in the city centre to demonstrate against the planned introduction of Covid-19 certificates in Northern Ireland. Many in the crowd outside City Hall carried anti-vaccine and anti-Covid certification placards and banners as the region is currently experiencing a surge in cases.Stormont ministers backed the introduction of a Covid certification scheme earlier this week which will be used in various settings including the hospitality sector.Tens of thousands, many of them from far-right groups, marched through Vienna on Saturday rallying against the impending Austrian national lockdown.Other demonstrations also took place in the Netherlands, Croatia and Italy. Four people were being treated in hospital in Rotterdam after they were seriously injured when Dutch police fired shots during a violent protest against Covid-19 measures, authorities said.Crowds of several hundred rioters torched cars, set off fireworks and threw rocks at police during the protests on Friday evening. Police responded with warning shots and water cannons.Rotterdam police posted on Twitter on Saturday that 51 people had been arrested, half of whom were under 18.“Four rioters where wounded when they were hit by bullets, they remain in hospital,” police added, in an update after earlier reporting two wounded.Authorities are investigating the shootings including looking at the question if the injured people where hit with police bullets, they addedThe city’s mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb, said the protest had turned into “an orgy of violence”. – Additional reporting ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"urgent solution needed for north in post brexit arrangements sefcovic","story":"European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic warned that the use of Article 16 by the British government would affect the overall trade agreement with the UK. Photograph: John ThysEPAPoolNorthern Ireland urgently needs stability in its post-Brexit arrangements and for Britain to come to an agreement with the European Union on how to ease their implementation, the European Commission has said.EU Brexit point man and European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic met his British counterpart David Frost following a perceived thaw in relations as the London government appeared to step back from using the sensitive Article 16 clause of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Mr Sefcovic said the change in tone was welcome but that concrete progress needed to be made swiftly, while Lord Frost warned that Article 16 was still on the table.“It is essential that the recent change in tone now leads to joint tangible solutions in the framework of the protocol,” Mr Sefcovic said in a statement, pointing to the need for a deal to ensure the transit of medical supplies in particular.“There is a genuine urgency. We welcome the progress this week. We now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line. This is a real test of political goodwill.”The EU maintains that a package of proposals it has set out to ease the implementation of the protocol, designed to avoid the need for a hard border across the island after Brexit, would halve customs formalities and identity and physical checks by 80 per cent. The British side has insisted that more is needed, however. In a statement after the talks, Lord Frost said that “significant gaps remain across most issues”.“Looking forward, the United Kingdom’s preference remains to secure a solution based on consensus,” he said. “But any such solution must constitute a significant change from the current situation, materially ease practical problems on the ground, and safeguard political, economic and societal stability in Northern Ireland. “If no such solution can be found, we remain prepared to use the safeguard provisions under Article 16.”The British government has previously insisted that any deal will require the removal of the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in overseeing the protocol, something that the EU side has ruled out, as it is a requirement for Northern Ireland to participate in the single market.Practical issuesAs the two sides remain far apart on the question, they have been focused on solving smaller practical issues, leaving the question of the ECJ until last to see if solving everything else can help surmount it.Technical talks between the sides, focused on customs arrangements and ways to ensure a seamless flow of medicines into Northern Ireland, have been taking place this week.In an address prior to Friday’s talks, Mr Sefcovic warned that the use of Article 16 by the British government would affect the overall trade agreement with the UK. This, he said, was because the Withdrawal Agreement, which the protocol is part of, and the EU-UK trade deal are interwoven. “The two agreements are intrinsically linked, one cannot exist without the other,” Mr Sefcovic said. “Settling the orce has always been and remains a precondition for our future relationship.” Officials believe the triggering of Article 16 would have a serious impact on the Irish economy, and have warned that it would be a signal of a serious deterioration in EU-UK relations.“Our solutions can become reality if the UK plays its part,” Mr Sefcovic said. “We need the UK government to reciprocate the significant move the EU has made.” How is Brexit affecting you?

It stated that anyone who accepts, claims, receives or retains a title of nobility bestowed by a foreign power would be barred from holding federal office.The amendment was sent out to the inidual state legislatures, and three quarters needed to vote in favour for it to become law. While 12 did, the required number at that time was 14, and the amendment never passed. But it was never thrown out either, and has remained on the table for more than two centuries.It followed a period of nervousness in America, which was surrounded by foreign superpowers: Canada was occupied by Britain, Florida by Spain and Louisiana by France.Napoleon Bonaparte’s younger brother Jérôme had married American socialite Elizabeth Betsy Patterson in what was the sensational tabloid story of the day, and there was fevered speculation that their son Jerome might run for office and that the US would be subsumed into the French empire.Constitutional experts have told The  that were the amendment to be revived, the 12 votes in favour are likely to still count, meaning that 26 states outside those which have voted already would be the new threshold for the amendment to pass.“It wouldn\u0027t take long for people to look at this as an opportunity,” said John Kowal, the co-author of a history of constitutional amendments, ‘The People’s Constitution: 200 Years, 27 Amendments, and the Promise of a More Perfect Union.’“I\u0027m not aware of any precedent, where someone who is publicly known and publicly uses a noble title from another country has run for political office,” he said. “I think it would be very controversial.“Britain has a very strong tradition of keeping royals out of politics and so this is perhaps more intrusive than anything a royal would dare to do in Britain. Meeting with senators to lobby for a bill - this is her injecting herself into US politics.”As things stand, the Duchess is eligible to run because she is a native-born citizen, but many questions remain unanswered, including which party she would belong to.“She clearly seems to have progressive politics and so maybe she would run as a Democrat, but what if she ran as an independent? Mr Kowal said. “Then you would have Democrats and Republicans all eager to prevent her from running by using this and there might be a rare bipartisan consensus if she were to run as an independent.”If there was a groundswell of demand for states to pick up the legislation and vote on it, the electoral map of America is currently leaning in the Republican’s favour.When the state legislatures convene in January 2022 (almost all are out of session now), Republicans will control 30 states versus 17 for the Democrats. In three states (Minnesota, Virginia, and Alaska), control of the two legislative houses will be split.But timing could be an issue.“One obstacle, I think, would be just acting quickly enough, because you need to get 26 more states to ratify in what would probably be a short period of time. But I would give this a fair chance of moving forward and maybe being ratified,” added Mr Kowal.The idea of the Duchess running for the presidency is not far-fetched.After being given the private phone numbers of Republican senators Shelley Capito and Susan Collins she phoned them out of the blue to press her case for paid parental leave being signed into law. The US does not have a federal paid parental leave programme, and the Duchess said on an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres show: “I will do everything I can to make sure we can implement that for people.”Tom Bower, who is currently working on an unauthorised biography of the Duchess, told Closer magazine: “The prospect of Meghan running for president is possible and I\u0027d even say likely. I really believe it\u0027s where she sees herself going.”Omid Scobie, the co-author of the book Finding Freedom, the biography which the Duchess did co-operate with, said: “Meghan is the embodiment of the American dream. One day we may see Meghan become president.”Last year, one unnamed friend told Vanity Fair that “one of the reasons she was so keen not to give up her American citizenship was so she had the option to go into politics.” The Duchess “would seriously consider running for president,” they added.The Duchess, who is expected to be in Washington in the coming weeks for a dinner with female senators who have backed the campaign for paid parental leave, may decide against a run for the top job.In the early 1800s, the fears of Jerome Bonaparte’s ascension were never realised. Instead, he became chairman of the Maryland Agricultural Society and founded one of the oldest private member’s clubs in America.More from NewsThe woke mob wants to replace virtue with \u0026#39correct-think\u0026#39Violence erupts for a second day in the Netherlands over coronavirus restrictionsIt’s a danger to the world that the precise origins of Covid-19 remain a mysteryRevealed: How much money your MP makes from their second jobBelarus plotting to send more migrants to enter EU, warns WarsawDefence spending on Union flags doubles in two yearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccines could offered children young five next spring","story":"Vaccinating primary school children is premature, Britain’s top paediatric body has said, after it emerged those as young as five could be offered the Covid jab next spring.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) on Saturday night called for better real-world evidence of the risks to the heart before widening the rollout further. It came after leaked NHS documents revealed provisional plans to offer the vaccine to children aged five to 11 in the first half of 2021.Young children face a miniscule risk of serious disease from Covid-19 itself. A recent study showed only six healthy children have died from the virus in England.However, there are concerns surrounding a very small risk of a heart inflammation condition called myocarditis from the Pfizer jab.Any decision to offer the jab to primary school-aged children would almost certainly be made to protect wider society, rather than the iniduals themselves.Dr David Elliman, an immunisation expert at the RCPCH, said: “You have to be absolutely certain, if that is your primary reason, that you’re not going to do any harm to the children.“The uncertainty for five to 11 at the moment is great. People will be demanding more evidence than we have in the UK before we go ahead with it.”Two studies from Israel have suggested that the risk of myocarditis following the Pfizer vaccine is very low.One, including more than five million Pfizer recipients, discovered 136 cases, while the other study of more than 2.5 million identified just 54 cases.The vast majority of those patients only suffered mild inflammation and recovered quickly.However, Dr Elliman said studies on the long-term effect on children’s hearts are needed, such as from the US, where they have begun vaccinating children as young as five, and Israel, where they plan to start imminently.“We will get a significant amount of data from places like the US and we will have the benefit of their real-world experience,” he said.It came as five European countries faced the threat lockdown within days after cases surged on the continent.Austria will return to lockdown on Monday, but Italy, Germany, Belgium and the Czech Republic are also facing renewed restrictions.Police in Rotterdam reportedly fired at protesters against a new partial lockdown on Saturday, with the Dutch invoking emergency powers.Meanwhile, tens of thousands marched in Austria against the sweeping new restrictions.Before the vaccine is extended to five- to 11-year-olds, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency would have to declare it safe, before which the JCVI, which advises ministers on the rollout, would also need to give the green light. More from NewsThe woke mob wants to replace virtue with \u0026#39correct-think\u0026#39Violence erupts for a second day in the Netherlands over coronavirus restrictionsIt’s a danger to the world that the precise origins of Covid-19 remain a mysteryRevealed: How much money your MP makes from their second jobBelarus plotting to send more migrants to enter EU, warns WarsawDefence spending on Union flags doubles in two yearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dismal truth eu has finally exposed","story":"Every now and then the EU goes into full-scale denunciation mode. Ordinarily provoked by an outrageous action by one of its Eastern members.For instance, earlier this year, the Hungarian government introduced legislation which would limit the teaching of “LGBT ideology” in schools. Gosh did the EU Parliament go to war. Emergency legislation was immediately passed in the EU Parliament to take legal action against Hungary for breaking the EU’s “values, principles and law”. Everybody from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron joined in saying that the heavy-handed Hungarian law was a threat to all of Europe.This past week, however, both the bigwigs of the EU and the Parliament itself have been silent in the face of a far more widespread infringement of liberties. Austria announced that it was going to send its citizenry into yet another lockdown. And that from February it would be mandatory for all citizens to have the Covid vaccination. No ifs or buts. In the future if you wish to leave your house in Austria you will have to be vaccinated.Germany looks set to follow suit, while a partial lockdown is already in place. Restrictions on those people who have not been vaccinated have now been tightened up in Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There have been violent clashes in Rotterdam between anti-lockdown protestors and police.So how is it that a part of a population can be held in their houses and the EU finds nothing to say about it? Is this not an infringement on the freedom of iniduals? Is the idea of confining a certain group to their houses based on their medical status not the grossest infringement on liberty any government could impose, short of actually imprisoning the populace?The truth is that at such moments the EU’s one-directional mindset is exposed. The EU dreams many dreams, but one of them is of a continent which seeks to safeguard more and more minority rights until everybody in the EU is free to be whatever they want to be. There is something to be said for this. But it is also simplistic and limiting.For instance it can find no place for questions or challenges which do not fit its own interpretation of the world. It is true that there are areas of Europe where it is harder to be gay, or trans, than others. But there are now countries that will not allow you to live a life if you do not want to take a Covid vaccine.I happen to disagree with the anti-vaxxers. I was no more concerned about taking the Covid vaccine than I was about taking the range of jabs I have had to take throughout my life for travelling through Africa and parts of the Far East. I did not fear the vaccine and nor did I see any reasonable reason to avoid taking it.But a certain portion of all our populations disagree. I think those people are misguided.  But they have concerns that any liberal society should regard as legitimate, however wrong-headed. If Covid were Ebola then perhaps it would require the heavy-handed treatments that we now see. But it is not. It is a disease that disproportionately targets certain groups of people. Such as the obese. Has any country even yet bothered to run a serious campaign trying to stop obesity in our societies? Of course not.  Because again there are things that are legitimate to concern yourself with and things which apparently aren’t if they do not fit the particular parameters of your concern.Whenever the EU is attacking Poland or Hungary, it does so purporting to be  and ultimate guarantor of the rights of EU citizens. But as millions across Europe attempt to protect their most basic rights – and the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike are punished – the EU is nowhere to be seen. It is not that its commitments are skin deep. It is that they are narrow and political in their nature. A fact that has never been clearer.More from NewsThe woke mob wants to replace virtue with \u0026#39correct-think\u0026#39Violence erupts for a second day in the Netherlands over coronavirus restrictionsIt’s a danger to the world that the precise origins of Covid-19 remain a mysteryRevealed: How much money your MP makes from their second jobBelarus plotting to send more migrants to enter EU, warns WarsawDefence spending on Union flags doubles in two yearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"not sleaze eroding support conservatives spending much","story":"Thesis: sleaze is a symptom, not a cause, of the Government’s unpopularity. The sudden spate of stories about alleged crookedness, some out-of-date, some plain wrong, is not the real problem. Rather, it is a product of the Tories’ alienation from their base. The benefit of the doubt has evaporated as conservative-minded people gawp in horror at levels of spending beyond anything that Jeremy Corbyn suggested.All governments reach a moment when the presumption of innocence is reversed. Six months ago, even three months ago, almost no one would have complained about MPs working as lawyers or company directors. The fast-tracking of PPE contracts would have been seen as a speedy response to a crisis rather than as cronyism.The spending of nearly £96 billion on transport infrastructure – a vast sum, even in these wastrel times – would have been celebrated as a vote of confidence in our old industrial heartlands rather than prompting a whinge-fest about miserliness. But once the narrative of a besieged administration takes hold, almost all news stories tend to get folded into it.Not convinced? You’re in good company. The general view is that the Conservatives are in trouble purely because of l’affaire Paterson. They led in the polls (with only one blip when they announced the National Insurance rise) until this month’s fateful parliamentary vote on the standards commission. Since then, they have been ahead in only one of seven published surveys.Stories about fatcat MPs, runs this argument, throw Red Wallers back onto their ancestral loyalties. Each new headline about outside earnings undermines Boris Johnson’s appeal to former Labour voters. The old clichés are coming back: “in it for themselves”, “same old Tories”, “don’t care about ordinary people”, “pinstriped spivs”.The trouble with this explanation is that there is nothing new in what is being reported. MPs have always had outside work, and a good thing, too. In an ideal world, they would all have second jobs – or, rather, being an MP would be their second job – and we would be governed by citizen legislators who shared the ups and downs of the economy with the rest of us.Why is it suddenly newsworthy that, for example, Sir Geoffrey Cox is a well-paid barrister? He was already a QC when he was elected in 2005, and he paused his legal career only to serve as a minister. His constituents in West Devon keep re-electing him with large and growing majorities, perhaps because they reckon that, given what he could be earning outside, they are getting a first-class MP at a darned good rate. Nothing in Sir Geoffrey’s circumstances has changed. What has changed is the attitude of Tory supporters.Something similar was true of every sleaze crisis going back to John Major’s lamentable premiership, when the word first came into common usage. A casual observer might have got the impression that, at some point in 1993, Conservative MPs started behaving badly. In fact, though there are always a few scoundrels, most of the stories making the front pages, from Alan Duncan buying a neighbour’s house to David Mellor having an affair, were not about corruption in any meaningful sense. Rather, they reflected anger at the government over the ERM fiasco.Similarly, the 2009 parliamentary expenses crisis was not just about bathplugs. It was also about the widespread sense that the entire political class had failed in the face of the global financial crisis.Sleaze is baked into voters’ assumptions. Most people vaguely assume that MPs are up to no good. Their definition of corruption overlaps heavily with their definition of “holds views with which I disagree”. They rarely distinguish between tiny transgressions and major malfeasances.Still not convinced? OK, here’s a test. Can you name either of the two peers suspended from the House of Lords after offering to move amendments for cash in 2009 – the first such suspensions since Cromwell’s time? Here were legislators offering to change laws in return for big payments. But – be honest – you had forgotten all about it until I mentioned it just now, hadn’t you?When people feel that a government is broadly on their side, they shrug off the peccadilloes of inidual MPs – even of senior ones. Tony Blair got away with rewriting his public health policy following a million-pound donation from Bernie Ecclestone because he was at the start of his term and was still thought to be, as he himself put it at the time, “a pretty straight sort of guy”.Until very recently, the Conservatives would have been able to overhaul the parliamentary standards commission without anyone much minding – quite rightly, as that institution is badly in need of reform. But, somehow, a tipping point has been reached.Why? My guess is that the easing of the coronavirus restrictions, and the associated sense that the crisis is passing, has focused attention on the Government’s economic policy. Spending increases can no longer be explained away as a one-off response to the epidemic. It is becoming painfully clear that we are seeing a permanent increase in the size of the state unrelated to the recent emergency.To be fair, the PM was always happy to call himself a big spender – a “Brexity Hezza”. He takes a boyish, almost infectious, delight in bridges and airports and whizzbangs of every kind. I remember him posing on the site marked out for the Millennium Dome, his thumbs raised, convinced that Blair’s grand projet would be a triumph.The trouble is that we have spent perhaps £500 billion more than we were expecting to spend two years ago. Restoring our finances should be the chief aim of economic policy as we claw our way out of lockdown. Yet we are carrying on as if nothing had happened – net zero, levelling up, the social care fund, a military presence East of Suez, an increase of nearly 40 per cent in day-to-day spending on the NHS, new railways.We might, after the pandemic, have been able to afford one of these things. Perhaps even two. But we can’t carry on with all of them as if we still had that half trillion.On Friday, the OBR reported that inflation had pushed the Government’s debt interest payments up by £14.8 billion, an increase of 62.9 per cent in a year. And this is just the beginning. Yet we gaily carry on printing money.At this stage, it is customary for a columnist to blame the Tsar’s wicked counsellors – to argue, in other words, that the PM needs new advisers. But I don’t buy that argument. There are some hugely talented people in No 10 and, in any case, there is no other Conservative who could hope to hold together the coalition that backed Boris in 2019.Nor is it fair to say that the PM has run out of steam. I don’t believe anyone else would fight as he is doing to get Northern Ireland out of the clutches of Brussels. I can’t imagine any other leader ensuring that our statues remained standing. I can’t see who else would pursue the idea, so successful in Australia, of processing illegal immigrants offshore, while still being ambitious when it comes to legal migration.The first freeport has opened on Teeside. Trade talks are getting under way with India and the Gulf states. Iain Duncan Smith’s report on deregulation, which proposed scrapping a number of needless EU rules, has been warmly received. We have avoided the wave of continental lockdowns. There are, in short, plenty of things for Tories to cheer. But none of it will amount to a row of beans if Britain runs out of money.The conventional wisdom is that over-spending is popular in the short term, before the full effects become apparent. But I’m not sure even that is true at present. Fiscal conservatives may be a minority, but they are an influential one. Their sense of betrayal is behind most of the bad press. Restoring order to our public finances, quite apart from being right in principle, may also be politic.     More from NewsThe woke mob wants to replace virtue with \u0026#39correct-think\u0026#39Violence erupts for a second day in the Netherlands over coronavirus restrictionsIt’s a danger to the world that the precise origins of Covid-19 remain a mysteryRevealed: How much money your MP makes from their second jobBelarus plotting to send more migrants to enter EU, warns WarsawDefence spending on Union flags doubles in two yearsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"often called p told go home also discovered gentle face","story":"The past may be a foreign country but it cannot be as brushed aside, as Azeem Rafiq has discovered. Having given harrowing testimony of the racism he has suffered he has been forced to apologise for his anti-Semitic comments made more than a decade ago. Nevertheless, Rafiq’s testimony to the DCMS still stands and struck many chords with me. Although I am a ‘Midnight’s Child’, born just as India became free, I was not brought up to hate England, but to value its goodness. My father insisted that we had an English car which he believed was far superior to Japanese rubbish and would never fail to start in the morning. He also believed that the English had superior moral standards. One of his favourite stories was about the abdication crisis. Whatever happens, he used to say, no orced woman will be allowed to become Queen of England. In 1961, when the Queen made her first visit to India, my mother took my sisters and me to wave to her as her motorcade passed by. Soon after I arrived in January 1969 to study engineering at Loughborough, however, I realised my colour made me an alien. I was often called a ‘P---’ and told to ‘go home’. It was just nine months after Enoch Powell’s rivers of blood speech. Nothing had prepared me for this hard, racist face of England.Just as Michael Vaughan is alleged to have talked to Rafiq about ‘you lot’, referring to the Asians in the team, an allegation Vaughan vehemently denies, the senior partner of the London accountancy firm where I qualified to be a chartered accountant made his views on ‘you lot of Indians’ clear on the very day he hired me. ‘I hope you will live in an area where there are not too many Indians. The trouble with Indians is that they tend to congregate together.’  My problem was that I didn’t find it easy to get away from the ‘Indian lot’. While I would have very friendly telephone conversations with landladies about renting flats, the moment I rang the doorbell and they saw me, they would invariably say, ‘I am sorry, I have just let the flat.’ After many such rejections, I decided to warn them on the telephone that I was from India. One day I saw an attractive advertisement about a place in Hampstead. After the landlady said she would be delighted for me to come over, I said, ‘Oh, by the way, I am an Indian.’ For a few seconds there was silence and then she said, ‘I am dreadfully sorry, but my husband would not like that.’Over time, many friendly white people reached out to me and I discovered that the kind, sweet, gentle, face of England that I had read about in India did exist. But when I returned to London after a stay in India in the late 1970s, I found that my skin colour could also mean physical danger. One Friday evening in 1980 I was travelling home from The Sunday Times on the Central Line when suddenly a skinhead let fly with his fist and floored me. As I scrabbled for my glasses, he got off the train with a laugh and the rest of the passengers looked away as if nothing had happened. After that, whenever I saw a skinhead, I crossed the road and, if they were in a group marching with a Union Jack, I hid in an alleyway. For several years, once it got dark, I did not take the underground, seeking instead the security of a taxi. But London cab drivers could not protect me from racist football fans when I reported matches. This was a time of very overt racism and, on match days, the National Front sold their magazine outside the grounds shouting, ‘Get your colour supplement.’ In March 1981, coming back from a Norwich match against Arsenal, an Arsenal fan chased me down the train shouting, ‘Coon, coon, hit the coon over the head with a baseball bat.’ It was then a popular football song. Fortunately, just as he caught up with me, I reached the first-class carriage where there was a policeman – a black woman. Six months later, returning from reporting a match between Nottingham Forest and Leeds, I felt I would not live to see another day. First, young boys, no more than 12 years old, taunted me. One of them pressed his face against the door of my compartment, flattening his nose against the glass in a racial ridicule. Another shouted Sieg Heil and started marching up and down the corridor. Then they entered the compartment. One of them asked me what I did. I told him I was a sports reporter. He retorted, ‘How do you know anything about football? P---s don\u0027t know anything about football, do they? Who do you work for?’‘Sunday Times,’ I said. ‘What\u0027s your name?’ asked another boy. When I told him he said, ‘What? Not Patel? All you P---s are called Patel. That is what the P--- who owns the corner shop is called. What do you think of the National Front?’ When I made no response he asked, ‘What do you think of Enoch Powell?’‘I understand he is a very fine Greek scholar.’ This reply seemed to throw them and for a few minutes silence reigned. Then they warned me that Chelsea supporters on the train were planning to attack me. Sure enough they came. They roughed me up but they could not decide who should be the first to work over ‘the wog’. By the time they made their minds up the train drew near St Pancras. Suddenly the cry went up: ‘Old Bill\u0027s coming.’ The Transport Police boarded the train and the fans fled. This did much to restore my faith in this country. But for five years after that I did not take a train, choosing to drive to football matches instead. I always arrived very early, often even before the stewards, so that I could park as near as possible to the ground. The best moment of the match was getting into my car and driving away knowing I could no longer be attacked. I also offered lifts to my white colleagues, hoping the presence of a white person next to me would provide more protection.The press box then was uniformly white indeed I hardly saw a non-white face in a football ground. At post-match press conferences, football managers would look hard at me as if wondering what a person of colour was doing there. It was a common belief then that Asians could not know anything about football. The popular joke was that if the Asians got a corner, they built a corner shop. Such remarks would have been unthinkable in the cricket press boxes of this country. Unlike football many of the journalists had old Raj ties, been to India and knew Indian cricket. Also, unlike now, when cricket at the county level is more uniformly white, English cricket was remarkably multi-racial with the great and the good of the game coming to hone their skills and advertise their ability. In Somerset Ian Botham’s greatest friend was Viv Richards and there was much talk in the press box about Imran Khan’s latest white girlfriend.The racial ide was whether England should resume playing cricket with apartheid South Africa. I spent many an evening travelling up and down the country debating with cricket followers why the ban on playing with apartheid South Africa should not be lifted. I was opposed by many cricket correspondents and administrators for whom the whites of South Africa were “kith and kin” and whose hospitality they had enjoyed when visiting the country. It was in pursuance of this story that I had my most memorable moment in journalism, a Sunday morning coffee with Nelson Mandela at his home in Soweto in June 1991. Mandela explained how he would use sport to reach out to the Afrikaners to create his rainbow nation which he did.And whatever racism existed, it did not ruin my dream of becoming a writer. The only job I ever got in India was through sheer nepotism thanks to my brother-in-law who was the senior partner of the country’s leading accountancy firm. When I tried for a broadcasting gig, the man who then ran sport at All India Radio asked me to get perfumes for his wife from Harrods. In contrast, doors opened in this country from the Sunday Times, Daily , where I worked for 12 happy years, to the BBC, without anyone ever asking me for a gift. Such bribery is unthinkable in this country.I treasure the gentle English face where everyone always says ‘sorry’ and has a deeply ingrained sense of justice. I voluntarily chose to live here, sacrificing greater wealth in India as a chartered accountant, to become a writer. But for my daughter’s generation it is different. As my daughter puts it, “This is our home. We don’t have another home. We should be treated like everybody else.”The challenge posed by the testimony given to the DCMS is how English cricket and society measures up to their expectations.:: Mihir Bose’s Dreaming the

flags doubles two years","story":"Defence spending on Union flags has doubled in two years in an effort to “remind us of the ties that bind us” as the SNP continues to push for independence.Government figures show total spending on flags increased by nearly 70 per cent over three years.The move is understood to be part of the government’s campaign to shore up the Union as the SNP continues to lobby for an independence vote in Scotland and unionists in Northern Ireland complain the Brexit protocol has drawn the UK border down the Irish Sea.Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the MoD said that in the financial year 201819 it spent £136,649.52 on flags, of which £25,351.97 were on Union flags alone.By 202021 the figures were £231,096.92 and £54,564.50 respectively, a jump of 69 per cent overall and 115 per cent for union flags.In the financial year 201920 government spending on flags other than the Union flag leapt to £253,549.30.The data show spending by the MoD under a central defence contract.The Secretariat of Defence Equipment and Support, the MoD department responsible for purchasing kit, said the figures do not provide details for flags that might have been purchased by inidual military units, such as army regiments, navy ships and shore establishments and RAF bases.These parts of the armed forces are “not obliged to use the contract and are free to purchase flags under their own local arrangements” the MoD said.A Government spokesperson said: The Government is proud to fly the Union flag as a reminder of our history and the ties that bind us.A large number of flags are used for ceremonial and non-ceremonial events, including national commemorations and state visits, and will regularly be replaced when damaged beyond repair.The Government is keen for the Union flag to be more visible, especially as it seeks to breathe life into the ‘Global Britain’ brand.However, efforts to show flags more obviously in routine government business has not been without controversy.In May, the BBC’s Executive Complaints Unit ruled that presenter Naga Munchetty was wrong to like tweets that were “disparaging of the government’s use of patriotic symbols”.The ruling came after an on-air discussion on March 18 in which she and Breakfast co-host Charlie Stayt interviewed government minister Robert Jenrick.The BBC presenters poked fun at Mr Jenrick over the size of the Union flag in the back of his Zoom shot.The pair were spoken to and reminded of their responsibilities, the BBC confirmed, after complaints about their reaction to the minister\u0027s flag.During the interview Mr Stayt had said: “I think your flag is not up to standard size, government interview measurements”.His co-host later apologised for ‘liking’ tweets that continued the light-hearted references to Mr Jenrick’s flag.The spending on Union flags has been criticised by the SNP.Mhairi Black, MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, said: It speaks volumes that the Tories think an overload of Union Jacks flags is the answer to promoting the strength of the Union.“Flags won\u0027t undo the poverty and hardship the Tories have created over the last decade through their decade of austerity and hard Brexit, nor will it make up for impending cuts to Universal Credit and prematurely ending the furlough scheme.“The Tory government’s obsession over Union Jack flags only highlights how thin the case for the Union is,” she told independence-supporting paper The National.While the Tories quadruple their spending on arbitrary flags and symbols, the SNP Scottish Government will continue to invest money in those most in need and focus on bringing the country safely through the pandemic,” Ms Black added.More from NewsThe woke mob wants to replace virtue with

From the attacks on Churchill, to the removal of recognition for JK Rowling for her views on gender identity – this doctrine is now increasingly the moral guide of our institutions, leaving the flawed heroes of the past and present and the imperfect truths of our national story ripe for censorship, rewriting and ruin.Actual achievements are treated as irrelevant, if the person responsible can be deemed to be problematic. Young people are being taught that goodness isn’t found in forgiveness, fortitude and courage, but in uncritically reciting the fashionable cultural mantras of the present. Everything must be made subordinate to the compulsion to show that we have the “right” views. It is a moral catastrophe.Consider two examples from the past few weeks. There is nothing inherently wrong with examining the legacy of historical figures. In fact, it is essential to recognise that they are complex, a product of their time and not infallible. But what we have today is much more extreme than that. When the Imperial War Museum, on Remembrance Sunday, ends a two-minute silence to honour those who lost their lives with a rap which included statements such as “Why, when some remember, do they see the same faces, the white faces from western places”, it is not just making a political statement. It is effectively saying that there is no occasion so sacred that it cannot be turned into an opportunity to display your “correct” political opinions. The museum has apologised and admitted that it “was not the moment” for the rap. But the fact that it was even contemplated highlights just how far many cultural institutions have strayed from moral clarity about their role.JK Rowling, meanwhile, has been a victim of a related phenomenon. The Harry Potter author has been vocal about her views on the biological reality of sex and has attracted controversy as a result. She is not being included in the celebration of the 20-year anniversary of the first Harry Potter film and it isn’t a stretch to conclude that this might have something to do with her “heretical” opinions on trans issues. Thus, the woman responsible for one of the most important cultural achievements of a generation is apparently deemed not good enough to attend a celebration of that very achievement because she doesn’t conform to the fashionable views of an identity-obsessed minority.We’re losing the language and sense of true moral worth in favour of the hollowness of “correct-think”. This is a tragedy for our culture, and a betrayal of the gains of the past and the future inheritance for those to come. We need to rediscover the importance of goodness, truth, beauty and shared meanings, or they will continue to be lost to an aggressive, philistine and corrosive ideology.Inaya Folarin Iman is a presenter at GB News and the founder of The Equiano ProjectMore from NewsViolence erupts for a second day in the Netherlands over coronavirus restrictionsIt’s a danger to the world that the precise origins of Covid-19 remain a mysteryRevealed: How much money your MP makes from their second jobBelarus plotting to send more migrants to enter EU, warns WarsawDefence spending on Union flags doubles in two yearsSunday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"axing hs2 leeds line latest","story":"Axing HS Leeds line is latest in long line of slaps in the face for the NorthNow the sharks are circling maybe one will finally have a bite - maybe this is the one that will finally cut throughopinionByKeir Mudie:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsEarlier this week, Boris Johnson described his handling of the sleaze affair as a car crash. How unlucky do you have to be to follow that up with a derailment  It is incredible, it really is, to see the amount of spin put on this one. It’s not what you were promised, it’s less than you were promised, but somehow – according to the Government – it’s even better. Not quite sure how that works. For a long time now we’ve known that the HS eastern leg was going to be scrapped. I spoke to someone earlier in the year and the explanation was quite simple: they’ve run out of money. Now we’re hearing that’s not the case at all. This new scheme is going to be better. It’s not though, is it  I was quite looking forward to being able to get back to Leeds about  minutes earlier. Another pint in Whitelock’s. That dream, ladies and gentlemen, is dashed.  But in some ways, that’s the least of the problem. Because connecting Leeds to London is fair enough but the ­priority has to be a proper transport network in the north It’s hard for people in London to understand sometimes. The north is big. Many people live there. There are great cities, industry, commuters, ­people who rely on public transport. I don’t know why that’s so hard to understand. But I suppose that is the nature of the way the north is treated. This is the latest in a long line of slaps in the face. Once, years ago, I was talking to a bloke who had worked on a regeneration scheme in the Midlands. It was one of those – similar to HS – that had got halfway donethen the Tories were elected and Whitehall pulled the plug.  I had gone to visit it and it was quite something. Rows of terraced houses all boarded up and shuttered and the roofs gone with one man, who couldn’t escape before the money ran out, still living in the middle of it. Surreal. Anyways, the bloke who was showing me round said that he had invited the civil servant in charge of the project up for a look round a couple of weeks before I got there. “This man,” said the guide, “was one of the top ones. Sharp suit, think he had some sort of honour, few letters after his name – posh, you know  “We took him round and he was really quiet, but I had a look at him in the car and he was crying. Really shaken.“And I spoke to him after and he said, ‘I didn’t realise what we were doing’.” That’s the thing. That disconnectbetween Whitehall and the north of England is a real, concrete problem.HS is the latest in a long line. What they promised wasn’t great. What they’ve delivered is not good. Maybe this one will be the one that really cuts through. Andy Burnham is becoming more and more active, and those Tory MPs who were already unhappy with the PM are even less happy now. I think I mentioned last week the sharks were circling. Now I get the sense the time is upon us that one of them is going to have a bite.

The National Booking Service will open up to people aged - to get their third dose of vaccine, and to --year-olds for their second doses. Around  million boosters have been administered in the UK. Vaccines give high levels of protection but immunity reduces over time, particularly for older adults and at-risk groups. Ministers are urging people to come forward to get extra protection over the winter months.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: Getting your COVID- booster vaccine is the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe this winter and will help reduce the pressure on the NHS. “While the government is continuing to monitor a wide range of data to ensure the country remains protected, we have very sadly seen a surge in cases in parts of Europe. “The most important thing we can do to stop a similar rise in this country is get the jab – so please get your vaccines as soon as you can so we can keep the virus at bay.”  People eligible for a booster can get the top-up jab from six months after having their second dose. But they can book their appointment from am on Monday when the National Booking Service opens for people aged  and over, as well as for young people aged  and  in England. Almost , teenagers in this category are currently eligible for a second jab, NHS England said. It added that almost , people aged in their s are currently eligible for a booster, having had a second jab at least six months ago. Bookings can be made online or by calling . Anyone eligible for a booster and at, or past, the six-month mark can use the NHS online walk-in finder to see their nearest walk-in site. More than a million  to -year-olds can pre-book their appointments from Monday, and a further . million invites will be sent to this age group in the coming weeks, NHS England said. Last week, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said while vaccines have saved countless lives and helped restore our freedoms in an unprecedented way, it is clear protection will wane over time after the first two doses of a primary course - that is especially so in older adults and those with risk conditions.  He said the waning is also beginning to show in the  to  age group, something he would expect to increase in the absence of boosters. He made the comment as the coronavirus-gtcoronavirus booster programme was extended to over-s across the UK. More than  million boosters and third doses had been administered in the UK as of Friday, the Government said, with more than one million top-up jabs recorded since Tuesday. Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Iaposve had my booster and I would urge everyone to get their vaccine whether their first, second or top-up dose as soon as possible, giving them and their loved ones vital protection over winter and the festive period. Vaccines minister Maggie Throup said people must make efforts to protect the gains we have made through our vaccination programme this winter, by coming forward for boosters when eligible. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid- vaccination programme, said: In the run-up to the festive period and what we know will be a challenging winter, I would encourage everyone who is eligible and invited to take up the offer of a le-saving booster as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It’s now clearer than ever that these promises have been broken along with so many others. We already knew the Tories’ National Insurance tax hike on working people won’t provide any extra money to vital services that help older and disabled people get up, washed, dressed and fed for at least  years - despite appalling shortages in care workers, unpaid family carers being pushed to breaking point, and thousands of elderly people forced to wait for care they desperately need. Now we know people won’t be protected from seeing their le savings wiped out either. This week, under the cloud of Tory sleaze, Ministers sneaked out changes to the way their cap on social care costs works. Ministers said their plan would mean no-one pays more than £, for their care over their letime – already a huge amount. Now we know elderly people with low and modest assets will end up paying more than expected, in some cases double.  Sir Andrew Dilnot, who came up with the original proposal for the cap, told MPs these changes mean the less well-off will not now gain any benefit. Age UK says they are “extremely disappointed” and that this is “the wrong policy choice.” I couldn’t agree more. Across the country, people with modest savings will rightly ask why the Prime Minister’s promise that no one need sell their house to pay for their care only applies to wealthier people. And working people will ask why their taxes are going up when they already face rising and energy prices, without fixing the crisis in social care. That’s why Labour will oppose these measures in the Commons next week. Britain’s elderly people, and their families, deserve so much better than this.

The European Movement will funnel tens of thousands of pounds into targeting  MPs who back the UK-Australia trade deal, which looks set to undercut British farmers and lower food standards. The money will fund a string of aposaggressive campaign adsapos, as the Movement aims to apospick offapos Conservative MPs, mainly in the South, to pile pressure on the government to change course.MPs targeted include Deputy PM Dominic Raab, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and high-profile Tory Jeremy Hunt. Activists from the cross-party pressure group will focus on three areas they think could sway voters: animal welfare, environment and food standards, like chlorinated chicken.One ad to be targeted at voters in senior Tory Liam Foxaposs North Somerset reads: aposSkinning lambs alive is cruel and shouldnapost be allowed anywhere near the UK market. Tell your Tory MP Liam Fox to fight for animal welfare standards” alongside images of fearful-looking animals.Another, apparently ripping off KFC branding, reads: aposHow do you like your chicken  Roast. Fried. Chlorinated.aposThe fresh attack comes as Boris Johnsonaposs Tories have fallen behind Labour in the polls after two weeks of sleaze allegations following the Owen Paterson row. aposBlue Wallapos Conservatives have also been spooked after the shock by-election result in Chesham and Amersham, which saw the Liberal Democrats overturn a ,-vote Tory majority in June. The European Movement has carried out exclusive polling which suggests a majority would back an outright ban on imported food that doesn’t meet British standards. Insiders have told the Mirror that the group believesit can convince one in ten of Tory voters in their target seats to switch vote, scores of Tory MPs could be aposunder threatapos. Labour peer Lord Andrew Adonis, who is chair of the European Movement and previously served as a minister during the Blair and Brown New Labour years, said: “Voters deserve to know when their Tory MP is backing a bad deal that critically undermines traditional British values. “So, we are putting Tory MPs on notice: Stand up for what your constituents believe in or be sure that we will let them know you let them down. “ Boris Johnson ’s Brexit is already causing empty shelves, empty pumps and empty pockets.He knows this Brexit isn’t working but his desperation to get a trade deal over the line at any cost is costing him the Blue Wall. “The British public is clear: Back British farmers, keep chlorine out of our food and stop slashing standards.” While the two upcoming by-election seats of North Shropshire and Old Bexley and Sidcup are not on the list, the two ballot box tests will be a headache for Mr Johnson as the governing party falls behind. Northerners are also levelling claims of betrayal at the Government over the integrated rail plan, which contains £bn less funding than was originally billed.

The Department of Health and Social care DHSC confirmed in July that emails and records exist relating to meetings between former Health minister Lord Bethell, former Tory chair Lord Feldman and representatives of Meller Designs.It has since been revealed that Housing Secretary Michael Gove referred Meller Designs to the ‘fast lane’, while he was the minister in charge of Government Contracts.Meller Designs was handed a total of £ million worth of PPE contracts at the height of the pandemic.The firm was, until January this year, co-owned by David Meller, who helped to run Mr Goveaposs failed Tory leadership campaign in , has personally donated £, to Mr Gove and a total of £, to the Conservative Party.Mr Gove had previously appointed Mr Meller as a Non-executive Director at the Department for Education, while he was Education Secretary.  In April it was revealed Mr Meller had personally contacted Health Minister Lord Bethell by phone, urging him to speed up the award of a £ million contract for face masks. But for four months the department has delayed releasing documents relating to the discussion, claiming it was still considering whether there was a public interest in doing so. The Mirror used Freedom of Information Laws to seek correspondence relating to the call in June.DHSC is required to publish the information within  working days - and is allowed up to a further  to consider the public interest in disclosure.After missing the final legal deadline of August , DHSC apologised for the delay, and claimed it was still considering the request.  Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner said: What have Ministers got to hide “Last week it was revealed that Michael Gove helped his personal donor get contracts, and now Ministers are refusing to tell the public what was a discussed in these meetings. “It is obviously in the public interest to know what dodgy deals were done to hand this Tory donor with no experience of PPE tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. “It seems like the Randox scandal is the tip of the Conservative corruption iceberg. Instead of more cover ups Ministers need to tell us the truth.”  Last month it was revealed DHSC had sat on a Freedom of Information request seeking records of meetings between Lord Bethell, disgraced MP Owen Paterson and testing firm Randox for  months. Labour used a Parliamentary procedure to force the Government to publish details of the call this week. But Health Minister Gillian Keegan made the extraordinary claim that the Government had been unable to locate a formal note of what was said during the call. She told MPs: The meeting [...] was a courtesy call from the minister to Randox to discuss RNA extraction kits. “That was declared on the ministerial register of calls and meetings, and we have been unable to locate a formal note of that meeting, but all the other notes that are available with regard to this - and that meeting, by the way, was after any contracts were let with Randox.

Yet Boris Johnson claims it’s “total rubbish” to say promises have been broken. We show why that’s flagrantly untrueBoris Johnson onboard a train from Wolverhampton to Coventry yesterday - after he had his rail plans sent to Coventry as well Image: Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Nov We’ve had four Tory-led governments since , and all of them have made bold claims about rail to the North.But yesterday Boris Johnson shattered those pledges, scrapping a key part of HS and downgrading Northern Powerhouse Rail. The HS eastern leg will no longer run to Leeds while only a section of NPR will be new high-speed track, from Warrington to Marsden. And hopes of high-speed stations in Bradford and, once upon a time, Sheffield have all been ditched. Labour said the Tories have “recommitted and re-promised” a northern rail revolution  times since . And Keir Starmer said voters are starting to “see the Prime Minister for what he really is,” adding: “He’s a Prime Minister who thinks he can make promises and then break them and there’ll be no consequences.” Sure enough, Boris Johnson is trying to convince voters he’s an honest Joe - claiming it’s “total rubbish” to say he’s broken his promises. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps took it even further today, bizarrely moaning that complaints are from “largely Labour leaders who are completely misleading people”. This is, of course, not true - Tory MP for Keighley Robbie Moore said the plan completely short-changed his constituents while Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “It’s a white elephant missing a leg”. And Conservative chairman of the Commons Transport Committee, Huw Merriman, put the focus on broken promises saying: This is the danger in selling perpetual sunlight and leaving the others to explain the arrival of moonlight.”  So what exactly did the Tories promise on HS and NPR  Here are  of the most egregious examples of pledges that have since been smashed.  October : Tory ministers propose a Y-shaped HS line via Birmingham to Manchester in the West and Leeds in the East. In the East, the line would stop in Sheffield Meadowhall and there would be a high-speed linking line to York. Phase One to Birmingham is set to open in , with Phase Two in  on an initial £.bn budget. The reality now: No HS stops in Leeds or Sheffield Phase One is now scheduled for “around ” and the surviving legs to Manchester and East Midlands Parkway are scheduled for the “early to mid s”.  October : PM David Cameron and George Osborne give their backing to ‘HS’ - “a high speed rail link connecting the north’s great cities which could signicantly reduce journey times across the region”. This later is named Northern Powerhouse Rail, linking Manchester to Leeds and possibly going further. The reality now: There will be no high-speed intercity link in NPR, only a high-speed section between Warrington, Manchester, and Marsden. The majority of NPR will be on upgraded existing track, saving £bn.  November : Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin declares: “We are already looking at HS. An east-west line joining up the great cities of the north. From Liverpool to Hull.” The reality now: Northern Powerhouse Rail is mostly not high-speed track, and will not run to Hull - it will stop in York. June : After David Cameron wins a majority, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin goes to Leeds and says: “The argument has been won. HS will be built, the full ‘Y’ network, from London to Birmingham and Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds, with construction starting in just  years.” The reality now: There will be no leg to Leeds. Construction on the eastern leg to East Midlands Parkway will only begin in the late s. November : The government unveils updated HS plans. They will still build a Y-shaped line, including the Eastern leg to Leeds - although Sheffield will be left off the proposed route, sparking fury. A document says “HS will have a transformational effect on journey times, with journeys between Leeds and Birmingham taking just  minutes, compared to  hour  minutes currently, and between Leeds and London taking  hour  minutes.” The reality now: Leeds leg has been dropped and the plan is for Leeds-Birmingham to take  hour  minutes and Leeds-London to take  hour  minutes.  April : After taking over from David Cameron as PM, Theresa May announces: “We remain absolutely committed to HS. It is a very important infrastructure project for the country. It is important that we increase capacity on this mainline and I believe that HS is the right way to do that.” The reality now: HS has been cut back and capacity to Leeds will be hit as a result. January : Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says: “We must keep on making the strategic case for HS and work hard to win over the public about its potential benefits. Let me reiterate. We are committed to a second stage between the West Midlands and Leeds and between Crewe and Manchester, completing the ‘Y axis’.” The reality now: The Y axis will not be complete. July : Boris Johnson takes over from Theresa May after triumphing with Tory members. He says days after entering office: “I want to be the Prime Minister who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did for Crossrail in London. And today I am going to deliver on my commitment to that vision with a pledge to fund the Leeds to Manchester route.” The reality now: There will be a Leeds to Manchester route but only about half of it will be on high-speed track. December : The Tories win a manesto based on the pledge: We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.” It’s notable that the manesto does not pledge HS in full, instead promising to review the line. The reality now: While Tories insist they are building NPR it is not the high-speed line they envisaged. Birmingham to Newcastle will take  minutes longer than originally planned.  February : Boris Johnson says HS has green light despite doubts. While he only commits to the line extending as far as Birmingham, with further lines to Manchester and Leeds up for review, he adds: “This is about finally making a rapid connection from the West Midlands to the northern powerhouse - to Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds - and simultaneously permitting us to go forward with northern powerhouse rail across the Pennines, finally giving the home of the railways the fast connections they need. None of that makes any sense without HS.” The reality now: HS will only link up to NPR in Manchester, not in Leeds. February : Transport Minister Andrew Stephenson promises NPR will be a “new rail link”. He says: “We need to build new capacity. New rail links north to south, and east to west. That’s why we’re going ahead with both HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail. These are not ‘either or’ projects. They are both crucial to our future prosperity.” The reality now: NPR will mostly run on existing track, not be a new link.  February : Despite raising doubts over HS plans and ordering a review, Boris Johnson tells the Commons: “I can certainly confirm that we are going to develop the eastern leg as well as the whole of HS.” By now the expected budget has soared beyond £bn. The reality now: The government as done the exact opposite of what the PM promised. May : Transport Secretary Grant Shapps promises full-fat HS but perhaps a semi-skimmed NPR: We are going to complete HS and include HS on the eastern leg to Leeds. The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which have developed a very long way since HS was first dreamt up all those decades ago. That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail. The reality now: Both HS AND NPR have been downgraded.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Patrick McLoughlinTheresa MayGrant ShappsBoris JohnsonDavid CameronGeorge OsborneChris GraylingEdward LeighLabour PartyConservative PartyRailwaysPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Arcuri alleged earlier this year in the Sunday Mirror that she and the PM had a four-year romantic relationship when he was mayor. In March she claimed they first slept together hours before he sat between his then-we Marina and Princess Anne at the opening of the  London Paralympics.She says they met up once a week at the height of the affair, and she sent him arty topless picture s. She admited: “I loved him. I adored him.”But she describes him as a “cowardly wet noodle” for not standing by her in the row over her presence on foreign trade trips. Mr Johnson avoided a criminal investigation after the police watchdog found no evidence he had influenced the payment of thousands of pounds of public money to Ms Arcuri, or secured her participation in foreign trade trips that he led.  However, the Independent Office for Police Conduct said it would have been wise for the former mayor to have declared their close association as a conflict of interest. The GLAaposs oversight committee is investigating whether he conducted himself in a way that is expected of people in public office. The Observer reported that Ms Arcuri has now agreed to be interviewed for the first time, and share notes she made in her diaries of their telephone calls and conversations.  A government spokesman told the Observer last week: As mayor, Boris Johnson followed all the legal requirements in the Greater London Authorityaposs code of conduct at the time. The GLA confirmed to the PA news agency it had received a complaint from Labouraposs deputy leader Angela Rayner, after some of Ms Arcuriaposs diary extracts were published by the newspaper last week. A spokesman said: The GLAaposs monitoring officer has received a complaint from Angela Rayner MP relating to the conduct of Boris Johnsonand has recorded it in line with the GLAaposs procedures. Recording a complaint does not mean that there has been any assessment or consideration of the merits of the complaint or that the complaint has any substance at this stage of the process.  The monitoring officer is seeking further information in order to assess the complaint. The Observer reported that Ms Arcuri told the GLA: I am prepared to show you or your investigators copies of the relevant pages. Mr Johnson has previously said his dealings with Ms Arcuri were done with complete propriety and previously welcomed the IOPC findings, as he criticised the vexatious claims against him. Previously, Mr Johnsonaposs press secretary said there was no case to answer following the findings by the IOPC. This work has been done - public time, money and effort has been spent looking into whether or not thereaposs any wrongdoing and it was found that the Prime Minister, the then London mayor, has no case to answer, she said. The GLAaposs monitoring officer will now review the complaint to see whether it is a serious complaint, and therefore whether it can be referred back to the IOPC. Ms Rayner tweeted: If Boris Johnson made promises of support to Jenner Arcuri because of his personal relationship with Ms Arcuri it is vital that the GLA refers this new evidence to the IOPC and that the IOPC reviews its decision to rule out a criminal investigation. We need a full investigation into whether the processes behind the public funding for Ms Arcuriaposs business and her presence on publicly-funded trade visits was the result of misconduct in public office by Boris Johnson.

As well as paying MPs as advisors, analysis found least  firms listed on the official lobbying register, or their directors, have donated to political parties or MPs since the register was set up in . They include Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who has accepted £, from lobbying firm Avre Partnership. In total, Avre and its directors have handed almost £, to the Tories and Tory MPs. The official register lists as their only client tech firm CityFibre, which is among the firms bidding to upgrade the UK’s broadband infrastructure. The Lib Dems received the most inidual party, with £, - although the majority of it is from party donors who also sit on the board of anti-Brexit campaign group Best For Britain. The Conservative Party accepted £, in cash and sponsorship, with Labour accepting £,. The total figure for all parties amounts to £. million since . The figures do not include the cost of staff lent to political parties by accountancy giants including KPMG, Pricewaterhousecoopers and Deloitte - which amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds more in non-cash donations to parties.Sunday Mirror analysis compared data from the Register of Consultant Lobbyists, Companies House and the Electoral Commission to establish which firms and directors had been bankrolling political parties. Of the firms on the register, the largest donors to the Conservative Party were linked to CT Solutions and Private Advisory - the PR giant founded by Australian spin doctor Lynton Crosby.  Between the firm itself and director Mark Fulbrook, the Tories accepted £, in donations from  to . Conservative Party co-chair Ben Elliot, gave £, to the party while he was a director of London lobbying firm Hawthorne Advisory. In total,  separate firms and their directors handed cash to the Tories, compared to eight for Labour and four for the Lib Dems. All the donations were within the rules and properly declared. There’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the companies, parties or MPs. A spokesperson for Brandon Lewis said: All Brandon’s donations are fully, transparently declared and are in line with the rules.” A Conservative Party spokesperson said: “Donations to the Conservative party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.”  Boris Johnson was shamed into backing moves to crack down on MPs second jobs last week, after the scale of politicians accepting cash for “advisory” jobs was laid bare. But instead of backing Keir Starmer ’s plan, which would have banned most second jobs, Tories voted through watered-down measures which would only affect a handful of MPs.It followed Mr Johnson’s botched attempt to save disgraced former MP Owen Paterson from a -day suspension over his paid lobbying of ministers and officials on behalf of private firms. Speaking after the vote, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told broadcasters: We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics. Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesnapost get it.

Thataposs more than the number of electors in the Home Secretaryaposs constituency of Witham, which has , voters. The partyaposs number-crunching showed a % increase in the number of people crossing the channel over the last year. Each year since , the number of migrants making the perilous crossing across the Channel in small boats has multiplied. From  in , to , in , to , in  and more than , have arrived this year, almost triple last year’s tally. Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, Nick Thomas Symonds MP, condemned the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister’s silence on the English Channel crossings as “inexcusable and reckless.” And branded the Home Secretary’s failure to prevent the huge numbers risking their lives to cross the English Channel as a “dangerous and le threatening situation” for those making the journey as well as a “broken promise to the British people”.  Boris Johnson has ordered a cross-government review into the migrant crisis as he is exasperated by a failure to stem the number of crossings from France, The Times reported on Saturday.But Mr Thomas-Symonds called on the PM to go further, and agree to a Channel crossings taskforce to meet weekly until the crisis is under control. He demanded on Ms Patel formally begin negotiations on new asylum regulations, publishing plans and timescales for the negotiation– with clear deadlines to prevent yet another winter of record channel crossings. And he said Ministers must prioritise the creation of properly managed safe and legal routes to help to prevent people from using people-trafficking routes and risking their lives on the English Channel – including the reintroduction of the Dubs Scheme for unaccompanied children. Mr Thomas-Symonds told the Mirror: “More and more people are risking their lives in the world’s most dangerous sea lanes in the English Channel. “After promising to address this, the Home Secretary has been completely absent and has lost control. In her two years as Home Secretary, far from the situation improving, we’ve seen an unprecedented % increase in numbers making the journey. “The Home Secretary has not only failed to end the dangerous and le threatening situation on the channel but also broken her promise to the British people to sort out the crisis on our borders. “It’s clear that the Home Secretary cannot be trusted in this issue and that urgent action is needed.”  Ms Patel has blamed the EUaposs open borders - established by the Schengen Agreement - for failing to check the movement of people through the bloc. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Washington, she said she was constantly pressing the French on the issue but that they were overwhelmed. Letaposs not forget that the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever - Schengen open borders, she was quoted as saying. More than , people have arrived in the UK so far this year after making the Channel crossing in small boats - almost three times the number there were in . This includes at least , who arrived since Monday, according to data compiled by the PA news agency. This number is set to rise as the exact figure for Tuesday is still being finalised by the Home Office. It is thought at least  migrants have died in the last few weeks while trying to make the dangerous crossing. It comes as campaigners threatened the Home Secretary with legal action over so-called pushbacks after reports she had sanctioned the tactics to turn migrants around back towards France at sea. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is reported to have said the British oscillate between partnership and provocation when discussing the migrant crisis in an interview with Lille-based newspaper la Voix du Nord, adding: We need to further strengthen collaboration. Officials have described how violence levelled at French police has intensied recently, highlighting incidents where an officer had their ear bitten off, and another where cannisters of CS gas had to be used to disperse a group of migrants. Sir Keir linked the increase to Government cuts in Britainaposs foreign aid budget as well as its failure to get a better agreement with France.We have not had strong enough agreements with France on this and we havenapost done the work upstream, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.One of the reasons many Tory MPs were unhappy with the Government for cutting its foreign aid budget is because they knew that budget is used, in part, to deal with some of the problems that are driving the movement of people. You will never solve the immediate problemyou donapost solve the upstream problem. The Home Secretary repeatedly says in strong language what she is going to do about the immediate problem and delivers absolutely nothing. You have got to do the work upstream otherwise you will never solve this problem. Downing Street said the Government was continuing to work extremely closely with the French authorities on the issue, but that the problem required a co-ordinated response from countries across Europe. We are facing a global migration crisis choreographed by organised crime groups who put people on these boats to make these incredibly dangerous crossings, a No  spokesman said. This is an urgent issue for the whole of Europe, requiring incredibly close working together with our neighbours - France, Belgium and the Netherlands - as well as our friends across the continent. It is a shared problem so we need shared solutions. Sir Keir said the Government also had only itself to blame for the failings in Britainaposs busted asylum system. Ms Patel complained earlier this week that a dysal system had allowed Liverpool bomber Emad Al Swealmeen to remain in the UK despite reportedly having had an asylum application rejected in . Sir Keir said: My jaw dropped when I heard the Home Secretary say that the problem is that the asylum system is busted. This Government has been in power for  years. If the asylum system is busted it is busted under their watch. Asylum applications used to be dealt with in about six months many years ago. It now takes years. All of us MPs have constituents who have been waiting two years or more for their case even to be looked at. Sothe asylum system is busted the question is who busted it and the answer is the Government.

A leaked dossier has laid bare plans to axe the shambolic system in . But a major step in winding it down will come next week. The Sunday Mirror understands the contact tracing system run by Sitel and Serco will be wound up early over crippling costs. Up to , contact tracers and call handlers were last week told their jobs were being axed, insiders said. In briefings by managers, teams were told there was “no money left”. Changes to the way tracing is done and more use of technology means jobs will be lost. And although Serco refused to comment, sources say they will not renew their contract when it expires on November . The Government’s plan is contained in a -page Whitehall dossier codenamed Operation Rampdown.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The document details how Test and Trace will be ditched and the requirement for those exposed to Covid to self-isolate for  days will end. It comes despite the UK recording more than , new Covid cases on consecutive days last week. With a deadly fourth Covid wave sweeping Europe, experts fear the Government has made the wrong choice. Independent Sage’s Professor Susan Michie, a behavioural scientist, warned: “If we want to avoid the kind of lockdowns we are seeing in mainland Europe we need to step up our efforts in managing the pandemic and not start shutting them down. “The World Health Organisation says a working test, trace and isolate system is a cornerstone of pandemic management. Unfortunately the model which the Government pursued has been eye-wateringly expensive and not as effective as it should have been. “The model is broken, the model was never the correct one... and it has been evident all along.  “Transmission rates are still high – there are more than , new cases a day and , deaths a week. It is not a situation a country like ours should be accepting or happy to live with.” Currently, those who self-isolate are supposed to be contacted by Test and Trace workers to check they are complying with the rules. Unvaccinated travellers who arrive in the UK may also no longer be contacted. A White hall insider said: “The trough has run dry and the Treasury isn’t prepared to keep feeding the beast. The problem is, however, that cases are still re and winter is yet to begin. “For all its faults, it’s a dangerous game to sack contact tracers when the pandemic is still raging. You only have to look to Europe to see how things change. This is going to cause problems tracking iants or even keeping an eye on local outbreaks.” Test and Trace was set up in May  with a £billion budget.This year the programme – heralded as “world-beating” by PM Boris Johnson – received another £billion. The total is equivalent to a fth of the entire annual NHS budget.The Tories were slated for outsourcing Test and Trace, with , consultants paid a typical £, per day.  Covid call centres, meanwhile, were staffed by minimum-wage workers on two-week rolling contracts. All NHS Test and Trace Covid testing sites in England began closing at pm from this month in a bid to start saving cash. But Covid cases have doubled four times since June. And the Independent Sage  warned that “a further doubling would put tremendous pressure on our health service”. The system has also come under fire from education bosses. Last week it emerged that the Government had been unable to say how many contacts of Covid cases have been traced in schools since the start of the new academic year. This comes as latest figures show that Covid cases are rising once again among pupils, amid warnings from heads about the importance of contact tracing. The Department of Health and Social Care said it did not have data on the number of people who had been identied and contacted as Covid contacts in a school. The UK Health Security Agency said: “ Contact tracing remains a vital part of reducing Covid- transmission and therefore of our current NHS Test  Trace service. “If you are told to isolate by NHS Test  Trace it is essential that you do, unless exempt. We are constantly looking to make the tracing service as responsive, efficient and effective as possible.” Comment MORE ON Boris JohnsonNHSThe TreasuryWorld Health OrganisationPoliticsCoronavirusSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Great sentiment. Responsible leadership at last. That was only a few days ago. But guess what happened next  That’s right.

It’s impossible to keep track of how many times our Prime Minister says something then does something . This pandemic is still raging. Cases are high. Winter is coming. We need to be on our guard. We need a leader we can look towards who shows us the right thing to do. Instead, we have Boris Johnson. Of course wearing a mask is not ideal. It’s not pleasant. It’s hot and stuffy and a nuisance. But it’s the right thing to do. You don’t have to wear one on every form of public transport – it’s not a legal requirement. But it’s the right thing to do. You know what the single most effective public health measure against the virus is  Go on, have a guess. Masks. A new study this week showed wearing a mask reduces incidences of Covid by %. So it’s the right thing to do for all of us. But especially the right thing to do for the Prime Minister. It just keeps happening. Even his apology this week sounded insincere – the giggling of a naughty schoolboy rather than a man who admits he’s wrong and vows to do better. He’d been caught without a mask at a hospital in the North East, not too far from where his friend went for an eye test. Mr Johnson said: “As for not wearing a mask in Hexham Hospital, which you wrap up into my general litany of crime, can I just say...” It’s not a serious remark. But this is not a serious man. For Mr Johnson to be caught out again is not really a surprise. But probably the most frustrating, exhausting, disappointing thing about this latest effort is where it took place. A train. A train in the north of England. A train running on a network that Mr Johnson and his Government promised to upgrade. We told you weeks ago he wasn’t going to do it, that he would let down the north and go back on his word. Sometimes, it is horrible being right. At least one good thing about this is that it means another blow to Mr Johnson’s credibility. His approval ratings are beginning to slide, the poll lead is shaky, and an election not the foregone conclusion it once was. Mr Johnson’s true character is emerging, revealing a lightweight figure not up to the task. The good times are over and the mask, as it were, has finally slipped.

So Geoffrey Cox will make a heartfelt apology to the law firm that pays him over £, an hour – for nipping off to do  minutes a year in his second job as an MP. The MP Julian Smith will declare: “It has been a deep honour to earn £, for a few hours work advising energy companies. I am deeply sorry that I neglected my duties to them, by popping off occasionally to earn extra cash by moonlighting as an MP.” Some Tory MPs suggested it can be “really grim” to live on the MPs’ salary of £,. This is why they’re forced into taking second jobs. So I’m sure they’d approve of a change in the law, so anyone earning £, or less would be allowed to work somewhere  while still being paid for the first job that they don’t turn up to.  If you work in Morrisons, you’ll be allowed to spend all week advising an investment bank, then nip to the checkout for  minutes a month to charge someone for three tins of baked beans. Then you can put in for a few thousand pounds’ worth of expenses, for essential items such as a flamingo cleaner and a submarine. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell insisted we should be “cautious” before criticising MPs who can’t live on £, as we shouldn’t expect them to change their lestyle and remember that they’re human beings. He was just as sensitive when he supported cutting Universal Credit, saying claimants often “didn’t need the money, they just like the extra £”. It’s touching how he wants to also protect the lestyle of people with no money. If they clean offices all day for £ an hour, then take their kids to a foodbank, an extra £ would disrupt that lestyle. So Andrew goes out of his way to safeguard it, because he cares. There have been suggestions that working mothers who need more money should take on second jobs. They could grab a colander and stand at the end of a sewage pipe catching the turds before they float into the sea. Or they could charge £ a day to be a bouncy castle for Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children at a birthday party. Environment Secretary George Eustice actually said that working mothers who are struggling for money, could “work in abattoirs” for extra cash. This is the trouble with struggling working mothers – too few of them are prepared to make ends meet by strangling a pig. This would also solve the problem of lazy pigs who live off handouts of swill, rather than get off their trotters and do an honest day’s work like Peppa Pig and Miss Piggy and Pinky and Perky. So we should be grateful that our hard-working MPs do at least give up  minutes a year of their time, to go into Parliament, and vote to ensure the poor stay happy by being even poorer.

Alan Forcer got a letter from Combat Stress saying his PTSD therapy was axed because of a cut to its budget. Alan’s ex-we Claire, , said the loss of his place on an anger ­management course sent him into a tailspin – and he was found dead four months later. Claire, mum to their son Josh, got a text from Alan which read: “DunnoI got the strength to start again.” Alan was a lance corporal with the Coldstream Guards but suffered years of mental problems after horrying duty in Kosovo.  NHS funding for Combat Stress was cut from  onwards.Alan, , got his letter in January  and was found dead in May after walking his dog in woodland near his home in Hartlepool, Co Durham. An inquest will be held next year. The charity’s letter said: “It is with great sadness that we cannot help you at this time. We recommend that you talk to your GP about finding a possible alternative service to help you.”  Claire, from Canewdon, Essex, who remained on good terms with Alan after their split in , said: “I believe Combat Stress losing its money and them having to cancel their therapy work ­contributed to him dying. “He seemed to be turning the corner in  and then their letter arrived. “It gave him a feeling of despair. I think he felt abandoned by people who understood him. “He was now being asked to speak to strangers and start all over again.”  Alan, who joined up aged , saw the bodies of civilians killed in ethnic cleansing horrors in the Balkans. He later suffered complex post-traumatic stress which went undiagnosed for years, said Claire. Through Combat Stress, Alan had been due to go on a six-week therapy course before being referred to the NHS Veterans’ Mental Health Service. Son Josh, , added: “Mum and I thought things were improving until they took the money away for his therapy. You have to be careful how you deal with vulnerable people.” Jeff Harrison, interim CEO at Combat Stress, said: “It was a very dficult decision for us to make as we wanted to be there for every veteran who needed us. “However, the cuts in funding had left us dependent on public donations and unable to provide a critical service to veterans nationwide. “We urge veterans and their families to call our -hour helpline on    or visit combatstress.org.uk.” The Ministry of Defence has ­been contacted for comment.

But with so many to choose from, how will you know which one is the best  Here, we test this year’s top meat, veggie and vegan sarnies and rate them out  for both taste and festive factor Waitrose Smoked Salmon, Egg and Truffle, £. With free range egg mayo, Scottish smoked salmon, mushroom and truffle sauce and spinach on rye bread, this sandwich is a fancy twist on festive food. It feels like a nice ‘light’ option, when compared to the others. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Costa Turkey Feast, £.  This festive sarnie – filled with smoked streaky bacon, pork, sage and onion stuffing and cranberry sauce on malted bread – packs a real punch. It has has just the right amount of sweetness and a good amount of cranberry sauce. However, it is more expensive than its supermarket counterparts. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Tesco Turkey and Trimmings, £.  If ever a sandwich screamed Christmas, this would be it. It comes with sausage, bacon, sage and onion stuffing and cranberry sauce and although the sausage sets it apart from the others, the meat is bland, and it’s a bit dry overall. A great meal deal option, though. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Greggs – Pigs Under Blankets Baguette, from £.  Described as “a tasty baguette with all the trimmings” this sarnie – with sausage, bacon, stuffing and a sweet port and cranberry sauce, is served hot. To be honest, it wasn’t the most appetising to look at and it tasted more like a normal breakfast baguette. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Marks  Spencer Turkey Feast, £.  One of my favourites out of all the homage-to-turkey sandwiches. There’s a big British emphasis on this MS one, which contains British turkey breast with pork, sage and onion stuffing, an onion mayonnaise, cranberry chutney and British bacon. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Morrisons Christmas Lunch, £.  The classic. A turkey sandwich with cranberry chutney, bacon, stuffing and mayo on malted bread. It could have done with a bit more sauce, but there’s a great amount of meat and % from all sales are being donated to Young Lives vs Cancer too. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Subway Tiger Pig, from £.  For a six-inch sub ‘Tis the season for Pigs in Blankets and Subway’s version is a giant pork sausage wrapped in maple-cured bacon, topped with all the trimmings you desire. It’s not overly festive though I ordered a foot-long by mistake, which it was really expensive at £.. Ouch. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Starbucks Blitzen’s Blue Cheese  Chutney Toastie, from £.  This is, in my mind, the ultimate tribute to the Christmas cheeseboard. Deliciously rich, the sarnie is packed with four cheeses such as Stilton, mozzarella, Cheddar and Emmental. Not only is this a fab hot option, but I reckon it would be a great post-Christmas party hangover cure, too. Taste:  Festive Factor:  Waitrose Vegan No Lobster Marie Rose Roll, £  A vegan Brioche-style roll filled with roasted oyster mushrooms in a ‘Marie Rose’ sauce with cucumber and rocket. I had high expectations for this festive sarnie as it sounded exciting but I was left disappointed. It was nothing like a lobster roll, but bonus points for trying something new… Taste:  Festive Factor:  Pret Vegan Christmas Nut Roast, from £.  Whether you’re vegan or not, this one is incredible. It is packed full of butternut squash, rocket and Christmas pesto made from pine nuts and, chestnuts, served with a vegan sage mayo, crispy onions and caramelised pecans.

William Verden, , made a heartbreaking plea: “I don’t want to die. My tubes keep me safe.” Doctors have ruled the teenager, diagnosed with a rare kidney disease two years ago, should no longer have le-saving treatment and receive palliative care instead. Mum Amy, , is aghast at the “death sentence” decision and is prepared to go to the High Court to keep her boy alive. Today, he was well enough to play golf – and can still hit up to  balls on a range. Amy said: “They are sending him home to die. I’ll never let it happen. “If William was in pain or bed-bound then of course I wouldn’t want him to suffer – but he has an incredible quality of le. He plays golf twice a week, I take him shopping, he plays with the local kids. We are in limbo wonderingthis will be William’s last Christmas, or whether he will even make it to thenhe has to go on palliative care.”  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter William, who also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, is kept alive through dialysis and without it would have “days or maybe weeks” to live, said Amy. But medics believe his complex autism means it cannot be carried out properly. Doctors treating him at Manchester Children’s Hospital were given a second opinion by an expert from Newcastle who said his kidneys are “devastated” – and a transplant is unlikely to work and carries huge risks. Amy said: “He is probably going to die from this. But he’s not ready to die now. He deserves a chance like everyone.” She fears William’s autism and ADHD have influenced the decision, as many kidney patients receive dialysis for their entire lives. William has interfered with tube lines and entry points, and at times needed restraining during dialysis.  Amy said: “It’s his disability, he’s not interfering with the line on purpose. He hated dialysis at first, then he got used to it – he just needs time. I don’t believe doctors would be advising us in this wayhe wasn’t autistic.”She and William’s dad, Will, , won’t accept Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust’s recommendation.They believe their son should continue to receive therapy and be added to the transplant waiting list. In December , a routine blood test revealed William, then , had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.  His kidneys were ing at just %. FSGS afflicts around seven in every million people, attacking the kidneys’ filtering units, causing scarring that leads to permanent damage and, sometimes, organ failure. William was initially on steroids but by May , having reached end-stage kidney failure, he was having peritoneal dialysis via his stomach at home. It uses the lining of the abdomen to filter blood inside the body. Amy joined her son at the dialysis machine from pm until am, six days a week. She said: “At first it was horrendous, it took two hours to coax him to get on and he’d have to be occupied the whole time. He would scream and get violent at times.”  Yet William adjusted and led a “normal le”, attending his special needs school until this September, when the tube opening became infected and inflamed with peritonitis. He spent two weeks at MCH, where medics said the treatment was no longer viable. Amy said: “It was the first time they said the words ‘palliative care’.” She begged them to try hemodialysis , where blood is pumped from the body to an articial kidney machine and ed by tubes. She said: “Doctors were not keen because they knew William touched his dressings and picked at his body.” But after a meeting between health trust staff, his social worker and his parents, William had a HD line fitted on September . He began visiting the hospital three times a week for treatment but often screamed, cried and pulled dressings off. Security staff were often needed to restrain him. A consultant’s report said William “tried to disconnect himself repeatedly, putting himself at risk as well as dialysis staff” and sessions often had to be prematurely stopped, resulting in “inadequate dialysis”. William also found the fluid and diet restriction involved in treatment dficult. In the first month, he needed the lines replaced or repositioned three times. On the third occasion, on October , Amy and Will were advised that palliative care would be the best form of action. “I was at a loss for words – then I just said no,” said Amy, who lives in Newton, Lancs. She said: “Yes, there have been dficulties with HD but he’s getting used to it now and just needs more time.” Children with FSGS progressing to kidney failure have a le expectancy of around  years following the start of dialysis but can live an average of  after a transplant. It is unclearthis dfers in those who have ADHD and autism. A letter from the Clinical Ethics Committee at Manchester University Foundation Trust said “every effort” has been put in place to treat William but concludes that continuing would do “more harm [...] than good.” There is an “extremely high” likelihood that FSGS would recur in a transplanted kidney, it found. A consultant from another hospital said he “can only envisage William lurching from one crisis to another on dialysis”. Reinsertion of dialysis lines “will gradually become more dficult” and “may become impossible,” he said, adding: “With these recurrent crises I think it would be highly unlikely he will live long enough to make it to transplant on the waiting list.” Amy, also mum to Levi, , and Ruby, , said: “Since going on HD his bloods are better and so is his quality of le as he’s not tied to the machine for  hours a night. Last week I took him shopping and for lunch – then he went to respite and played pool until pm. “Every Sunday he goes golfing. The other day he walked . miles on the course.” And fun loving William has even dressed up as a chef at his school and as a security guard at hospital. If MFT and William’s parents cannot reach a resolution the courts will have to decide. Amy said: “This whole thing is a nightmare. My daughter is devastated, she cries all the time. I will never live with myselfI don’t fight for him to have this chance.” Liz Davis, of Irwin Mitchell lawyers, which is supporting William’s family, said: “All Amy wants is the best possible le and future for William. We’ll continue to support Amy and the family to ensure their voices are heard.” MFT, which manages the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, said: “We recognise that this is a very dficult time for William and his family and we will continue to support them.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsLe expectancySocial workersTeenagersTherapyAutism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Covid cases are rocketing across the continent with rates so concerning a number of nations are re-introducing tougher restrictions despite hopes we had turned the corner on the pandemic. Austria has announced that from Monday it will go back into a full lockdown - the first country in Western Europe to do so and Germany has indicated that it may be forced to follow suit due to soaring infection rates.The World Health Organizationhas warned that the continent is at the epicentre of the pandemic. The UK has the highest number of Covid infections to date in Europe but despite daily infections staying above , for weeks Boris Johnson has no current plans to introduced tougher restrictions.  However he hasnapost ruled out another Christmas lock down yet. UK scientists say the best way to swerve any need to plunge the nation back into a lockdown is to push forward the vaccine programme which includes giving booster shots to double-jabbed Brits. Britain is giving booster doses faster than the rest of Europe and have handed out twice as many doses per head as Austria, France or Germany. A government source praised the % protection rate a third jab can give, telling The Times: Itaposs a much bigger effect than we thought. It absolutely underlines how crucial the booster programme is to get us through the winter. Thereaposs a lot of uncertainty out there but the thing we know with most certainty is that getting boosters rolled out is the best thing we can do. Hereaposs a breakdown of the Covid rates in the  worst-hit countries in Europe and what each Government is doing to tackle the spread of the virus.  UK The UK has the worst number of total Covid infections in Europe with ,, cases of Friday. Its infection rate stands at  cases per , people in the last seven days. The UK has administered at least ,, doses of Covid vaccines so far which is enough to have vaccinated around .% of the country’s population. The nation is still in Plan A of its Covid response with the government refusing to trigger Plan B. Mr Johnson said this week that he saw no need to switch to the new measures which stops short of a lockdown but brings back mask mandates, vaccine passes and work from home orders.  But he has admitted hat he was cautious of rising cases in parts of Europe. He said: We donapost see anything in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to go to Plan B. Weaposre sticking with Plan A. But what we certainly have got to recognise is there is a storm of infection out there in parts of Europe. He also told his Cabinet on Tuesday that while boosters will be the main defence, “we are still not out of the woods and we cannot be complacent”.It has also been reported that children aged five to  are set to be included in the Covid vaccine rollout in the coming months under leaked NHS proposals. Austria The average number of infections in Austria has peaked with , cases per , people in the last seven days.In total, the nation has administered . million vaccines doses which means around two-thirds of Austriaaposs population is fully vaccinated against coronavirus -gtcoronavirus - one of the lowest rates in western Europe.On Monday it will become the first country in western Europe to reintroduce a full lockdown with non-essential shops being closed and Austrians ordered to work from home. The restrictions will be in force until December, but will be reassessed after  days, authorities said. But in addition people will be legally required to be double jabbed by February . Announcing the measures, the Austrian Chancellor said: We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated. It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.  Belgium Belgium has recorded  infections per , people in the last seven days. Belgium has administered at least ,, doses of covid vaccines so far which is enough to have vaccinated around .% of the country’s population. The Belgian Government has toughed up its restrictions this week and has made home-working mandatory four days a week. This is said to have angered some employers and jobs groups. People are required to wear a face mask on public transport and shops, and they must show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter all hospitality and fitness venues. Children as young as  - it was previously  - now have to wear face coverings too.  Germany Germany has recorded  infections per , people in the last seven days. The nation has a lower vaccination rate than average in Western Europe with nearly % of the population double-jabbed. German health minister Jens Spahn said his country is gripped in a national emergency, with rising cases sparking alarm. He said: We are now in a situation - eventhis produces a news alert - where we canapost rule anything out. We are in a national emergency. Under new rules only people who are double-jabbed or have recovered from the virus will be allowed to access to public spaces like sporting events, cultural shows and restaurants.  The Netherlands has recorded  infections per , people in the last seven days. The nation has administered ,, doses of Covid does so far which means around .% of the country’s population is double-jabbed. The country ed to a partial lockdown last week with the Government ordering restaurants and shops to close early and barred spectators from major sporting events. Supermarkets and non-essential retailers have also been told to close earlier, and social distancing measures will be re-imposed. The government also recommended that no more than four visitors can be at one private home. The stricter rules were sparked angry protests with police force to use water cannons to beat back crowds in Rotterdam on Friday night. Police said seven people, including a number of officers, were injured during the unrest and there were dozens of arrests. The force said the riots had posed a threat to le. Authorities shut down public transportation in the city, closed the main train station and ordered people to go home. FranceFrance has recorded  infections per , people in the last seven days.The nation has administered ,, Covid doses which means around .% of the nation’s population is double-jabbed.Despite the high vaccination rates, France is still seeing a spike in infections. Last week, President Emmanuel Macron said: We have not finished with the pandemic. A Covid pass became a key requirement across France in late July. People need to show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from Covid to enter most museums and cinemas and to travel by train and plane. The country has seen a wave of street protests since the measures were introduced.  Spain Spain has recorded  infections per , people in the last seven days.The nation has administered ,, Covid doses which means around .% of the population is double-jabbed.In Spain it is mandatory to wear a face mask in indoor spaces.

Insiders say CCTV experts are trawling footage from the days before last Sunday’s attack to seeEmad Al Swealmeen was caught on film. Footage is believed to show a blue Ford Fiesta pulling up at Liverpool Women’s Hospital at around .pm on Saturday –  hours before the blast – and staying for around five minutes. The Sunday Mirror understands a member of staff raised the alarm about the car, which is thought to have been carrying five young men. An insider said: “CCTV specialists were at the hospital for three days. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “They are investigating whether the bomber scoped out the hospital because he has been buying parts since April. They wanted to know whether he had been in the hospital or not. “A blue Fiesta pulled up the night before and it had five men in it. They were acting suspiciously. It stayed for six minutes. They didn’t get out at all. “You can’t make out who the men were from the CCTV. It could have been him and his mates – we just don’t know.” Al Swealmeen, , drew up outside the hospital in a taxi at .am last Sunday. His homemade bomb went off seconds later. Driver David Perry, , miraculou sly escaped before his cab burst into flames. He’s now being cared for at home by we Rachel.  It was originally thought Al Swealmeen planned to detonate his homemade bomb at a nearby Remembrance Day parade. But eyewitnesses insist David, who temporarily lost his hearing, said his passenger had always intended to go to the hospital. One said: “The driver looked in the back just before the bomb went off. He said he saw a red flashing light and the bomber rustling around in his jacket. He heard vibrations and stuff. “As soon as the bomb went off, the back left passenger door blew open and the taxi driver’s door opened.”  A string of hospital staff and passersby helped David and tried to put out the fire before emergency services arrived. A witness said: “The driver wanted to go to the car to get his phone but the car was ablaze. He said, ‘I want my we, I can’t hear.’ His eyes were wide open. “It’s amazing he got out alive. I think the seat took most of the impact. But he didn’t have a Covid screen in place like people have said – which makes it even more incredible he survived.” Security guard Will Cowan,  charged towards the burning car as his horried mum Christine watched but it was too well alight for him to help. Christine had been working in the hospital cafe when the blast happened. Our witness said: “Because Will dealt with it, she was crying her eyes out saying, ‘I thought you were going to die’.” Will’s car was one of two destroyed by the blast. Tonight, he said he didn’t want to speak about the attack. Traumatised staff have been offered counselling. The insider said: “Everyone has been on edge. People have been shaking. The atmosphere is horrible.” And new mums being cared for when the bomb went off have called in to report physical and mental issues. Our source said: “New mums are saying they are having problems.“One said she can’t leave the house, she’s having headaches and can’t hear.Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, Head of Counter Terrorism Police North West, said on Friday his investigation was making “signicant progress” after speaking to Al Swealmeen’s brother. He said: “This has given us an insight into his early years and an understanding of Al Swealmeen’s le and his recent state of mind.” The bomb had ball bearings attached, which would have acted as shrapnel. Mr Jackson added: “Had it detonated in dferent circumstances it would have caused signicant injury or death. “We still do not know why the device exploded when it did, but we are not discounting it being unintentional. “It is a possibility movement of the vehicle or its stopping caused ignition.” Comment MORE ON CCTVHospitalsTerrorismCCTV footageSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was based at a fulfillment centre near Manchester Airport and worked in a ft-long workstation that she described as a cage. The former employee, from Manchester, said she had to find, scan and pack items as quickly as possible - with a target of  items per hour, one every ten seconds. She said she could not take toilet breaks as she feared not being able to reach her target and claimed workers were watched by cameras at all times. The woman, in her s, said she lost weight while working for Amazon and described the job as exhausting. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror She told The Sun : They expect you to be like a robot, constantly keeping up your speed without stopping or needing bathroom breaks. Itaposs not realistic for a human.Itaposs really intense because there are cameras everywhere, too, and people constantly walking around monitoring your performance. It was so bad we used to joke with each other, ‘Ready to start your slave labour sht ’ and there was some truth to it. She claimed employees were forced to carry out their duties amid brutal working conditions - and said that after experiencing it first hand, she will never order from the online giant again. The former Amazon worker said she was once told off for ing from her -minute lunch break one minute late and that she received no sympathy when she explained the canteen was  minutes walk from her workstation. She added she avoided going to the toilet when she began working for Amazon because even though managers did not forbid it explicitly, they would tell employees offtheir performance dropped.  The former employee also said that performance indicators, which showed how many items workers managed to pack in a sht, caused anxiety and unneeded stress. She said: In reality, you can’t keep working at the same pace all week because you’re shattered, especially after ­several days of work. She claimed that her knees began to swell after working at the warehouse for two months and her doctors told her she should rest - which she said was impossible at Amazon. In a separate incident, she said her skin became irritated after a product leaked on her arm, but claimed the first-aider did not do anything to help and did not get close to her due to the risk of Covid-. She said that after she went to the toilet to wash her arm, someone went looking for her as she had been missing from her workstation for ten minutes. The woman said other colleagues had similar negative experiences at Amazon and is now urging customers to consider employeesapos alleged poor working conditions when ordering from the retailer. In , former Amazon worker Michael Gabay told The Mirror he completed  days of hell at the biggest UK depot of the worldaposs richest company.He claimed workers walk around like zombies in -hour shts with limited breaks under pressure to work faster, with employees packing , items on the night sht he did at the million sq ft depot in Tilbury, Essex. An Amazon spokesperson told The Mirror the company has a system to recognise workersapos performance, as well as coaching for employees who feel like they need help to reach their goals. The company also added that performance is evaluated over a long period of time and that it is only measured when an employee is at their workstation and logged in to do their job, meaning they can log offthey need to go to the toilet or talk to a manager. The spokesperson added that employees can go to the toilet whenever they need it as toilet breaks are not monitored. They also said that in all the fulfillment centres, employees receive two -minute breaks every day. Amazon said in a statement: Working in a warehouse is not for everyone. But for those who don’t want to sit at a desk all day, it’s a hugely rewarding job. The fact is,you want to work in a warehouse, you’ll want to work at Amazon. In addition to offering excellent pay and benefits we ensure that safety is a priority, that everyone is supported, treated with dignity and respect, gets regular breaks, and works at a comfortable pace.

Image: Paul Beard   SWNSByPaul SuartGraeme Murray:,  Nov A teenage girl is unable to have children after her ex-boyfriendaposs stunt ended in disaster. Adam Woodcock, , has been jailed for  months after pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving that inflicted horric injuries on his girlfriend at the time. She now cannot go out unaccompanied because of a spinal injury she suffered which causes her legs to regularly give way beneath her. The girl also had to give up college and her hopes of becoming a mechanic, a judge at Warwick Crown Court heard.Prosecutor Graeme Simpson said the crash occurred at around pm on the evening of November  last year, CoventryLive reports. “It was dark, and Beausale Lane, a country lane near Warwick, is a twisty, narrow lane. It is well-known as a hazardous road, particularly at night, he said. On that evening Woodcock, of Bishops Tachbrook, near Leamington, was driving his Vauxhall Corsa, to which he had carried out a number of sporty modications. His then -year-old girlfriend was next to him and her two younger brothers in the back. There was loud music playing and as they headed towards Beausale Lane he told them: “I’m going to take you down this really scary road that everyone s**** themselves at.”Woodcock then began racing along Beausale Lane in excess of the speed limit and in damp conditions as one of the boys filmed it on his mobile phone, which was played in court. At one point he lost control of the car and skidded on a bend, but continued to drive in the same way – and the second time he lost control, he hit a tree to the left side of the road.  After the crash, all four of them got out and ran a short distance from the car before the girl, who cannot be named because of her age, found herself unable to stand or even sit because she was in such extreme pain, and she curled up on the ground. Despite her obviously severe injuries, Woodcock, who was extremely concerned about his car, on which he had spent a lot of money on the modications, did not want to call the police – and it was one of her brothers who did so. They were taken to hospital, and although her brothers were discharged the next day, the girl remained in an induced coma for five days.She had a perforated bowel which required surgery and led to her developing sepsis, and a fractured vertebra which left her spine damaged to the extent that she was in a back brace for five months and had to learn to walk again.The impact on the girl, who will require further surgery when she has finished growing, has been utterly devastating. She requires -hour care from her mother, and is not allowed to leave home unattended, on doctor’s orders, because there is dficulty with her brain communicating with her spinal cord, and her legs give way regularly,” explained Mr Simpson. The girl, now , can no longer attend college because of that, with her hope of becoming a mechanic being taken away – and she and her mother were told the sepsis has left her unable to have children. Recorder William Edis QC said: “It is dficult to imagine a more signicant injury to a young woman of her age.” Mr Simpson added: “She and her family have had no expression of remorse at all from the defendant - no apology.”ill require further surgery when she has finished growing, has been utterly devastating. “She requires -hour care from her mother, and is not allowed to leave home unattended, on doctor’s orders, because there is dficulty with her brain communicating with her spinal cord, and her legs give way regularly,” explained Mr Simpson. Queenie Djan, defending, said: “He is a young man of good character. This is his very first interaction with the criminal justice system. “Mr Woodcock has great remorse and great regret for his actions on that night. He is struggling and is broken by the devastation and hurt he has brought on that family as a result of what he’s done. “He knows it will never be enough, but extends his sincerest apologies to the family.” Recorder Edis commented: “I don’t doubt, whether he expressed it to the family or not, that he is remorseful. “He was a typical -year-old with more testosterone than common sense. He was showing off. The only reason he went on that twisty single-track road was to scare his passengers.” And he told Woodcock: “The driving you indulged in was premeditated and deliberate. You deliberately drove down a lane, knowing it would be dangerous, at speeds which were wholly inappropriate resulting in what I consider a predictable outcome. “Some people do like to seek thrills, but where the big dipper is regularly inspected by health and safety, this was a country lane, in the dark, surrounded by solid objects such as trees, and you were going far too fast. “You lost control and your car slammed at some speed into a tree. All of you got out and your initial thought was that none of you had suffered serious injury. “That tragically was not the case, because [the girl] has suffered permanent, le-changing injuries. Her entire le has been altered for the worse. At the age of  she has become as reliant on her family as she ever has been – and that is your fault because you drove catastrophically dangerously. “No sentence other than immediate detention seems to me to be appropriate.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Crown courtDangerous driving\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Winter is actually a time of richness and le.” Chris, , who first appeared on TV fronting CBBC’s The Really Wild Show  years ago, says it is a misconception that the natural world shuts up shop for winter – and that comes from the prevalence of broadleaf trees. “When we see them looking stark and bare, we think they’re leless, but they are replenishing,” he says.  “If you look at most trees once the leaves come off, they have buds on them for next spring.” Here, Chris reveals how you can help some of the most common hibernating ­animals survive – and thrive – this winter. Get gardening Winter is the perfect time of year to take stock of your garden and prepare for the coming  months. Chris says: “You can see it more clearly as it largely dies back. It’s a time for making decisions, becauseyou wait until spring, it’ll be too late.  “Take a look at your garden in the winter and think, ‘What can I do for it in terms of nature ’ It’s a good time to put a pond in, becauseyou wait until spring it’s too late for the frogs and newts to arrive.” The key to becoming a good gardener is to remain active throughout winter. “It’s the best time to plant trees and shrubs,” Chris says. “If you plant them when they have leaves on and there’s a drought, and you don’t ­water them, they’ll die. “So put them in when there’s no leaves in the winter and they will prosper in spring.” What is hibernation  Hibernation is a state where animals slow down their metabolism to use as little energy as possible over the winter, when food is scarce. Their heart rate drops, as does their breathing, and they survive on fat stores built up over the summer.  It’s called hibernation rather than sleep because the brain cycles the animals go through are dferent. It’s more of an extreme slowing down but only three British mammals truly hibernate – bats, hedgehogs and dormice. Birds have either adapted to the season or ­migrate, while reptiles go into a state called brumation. Box clever for bats Bats are unfairly seen as scary but the world’s only flying mammals make an important contribution to our environment. Chris recommends putting up bat boxes to protect them during the winter months – although they won’t acquire residents until next year.  “Most bat boxes will be occupied in the summer when you’ve either got the males roosting or you’ve got the maternity roost for females,” he says. “In winter, bats want stable temperatures, humidity and air flow, and they can’t get that in a bat box, so they go to hollow trees, caves and concrete buildings. “Butyou put boxes up in spring, it’s too late, because bats go on little foraging flights looking for places when they wake up. “The more you put up, the greater likelihood any one of them being used is. They like to have a network of dferent boxes in the same place.” Feed the birds All garden birds need our help in winter andyou look after them well, you can expect plenty of visitors come the spring. Chris says: “Put up nest boxes. By February, things like blue tits are looking around, thinking, ‘Are there any holes for me to nest in ’ “They don’t lay their eggs until April but by that stage they’ve figured it out. If they haven’t found a nest box in your garden, they will go next door.” Feeders will also help to ensure your resident birds get the nutrients they need – but you have to pay them some attention. “The key thing is to keep them clean,” Chris says. “A number of diseases are sweeping through our finch population. They are generally transmitted by saliva, so it’s the area underneath the feeder you need to keep clean, and the feeder itself. “Putting water out is equally important because birds need to bathe and drink.” Build borders Wooden fences might be easier to erect than hedges but investing in a natural border for your ­garden will pay idends for the ­resident wildle. “Hedges are better than wood – they’re ­going to support more le,” says Chris.  “They take a while to grow and need a lot more maintenance than a fence, so you’ve got to be thinking about whether you are going to be able to make that investment, look after it, trim it and shape it. “Butyou put a fence up instead, it’s a good place to hang bird feeders and bird ­boxes, as long as cats can’t get to them. “Also, make sure you cut a hole in the ­bottom of the fence for hedgehogs to get through – or a bigger hole to help the local foxes and badgers.” Give a hog a home Hedgehogs are one of our most-loved native mammals but, tragically, their numbers have halved since . Their hibernation season is currently under way but Chris says you should not be alarmedyou see one of these spiky little creatures awake.  “It’s not a catastropheyou see a hedgehog in ­winter,” he says. “They don’t go to sleep in October and wake up in March – they will wake up in milder conditions, go out and scramble around to find food. “If they’re tiny, then the likelihood is they might be in trouble and you should think about taking them to a wildle hospital for safety. “Butyou find a bigger animal, the likelihood is that they will move from one hibernation site, come out and have a little forage, then they might go back to it or go to another one.” Hedgehogs need ambulances too Hedgehog rescuer Ellen Cole has nursed  of the animals back to health since finding one on her street five years ago. The animal lover had never seen a real hedgehog until she discovered one covered in burns and unable to see in .  “I wrapped it in a blanket and took it to the vet, who suspected it had been ­accidentally poisoned by de-icer that had fallen in a puddle,” says Ellen, . “Sadly, it had to be put down. But it sparked my interest in how I could help, especially when I found out numbers were declining.” Ellen, from York, now juggles working at her own marketing agency with fostering hedgehogs in need from vets, the RSPCA, Hedgehog Emergency Rescue in Bingley and the Hedgehoggery in Shipley. She also has a network of  volunteers across Yorkshire who act as ambulance drivers for hedgehogs. “People who find one don’t often have the means to get them to an expert so this ensures they can be cared for,” she says. “We’ve transported around , hedgehogs so far.” Next year, Ellen hopes to start a charitable organisation providing hedgehog education to the public. She also recommends creating a “hedgehog highway” in your garden and cleaning out bird feeders once a week. “There are so many hazards for hedgehogs that people are unaware of and would make a big dferencethey made a few changes,” she says.■ Help Ellen by liking the Yorkshire Hedgehog Volunteers page on Facebook.

He is haunted by a mixture of grief and despair – and burning anger at a botched Army investigation into little Katrice’s disappearance from a garrison NAAFI store while shopping with her mum. That fury was only deepened by -year-old Richard’s last meeting with the Royal Military Police who revealed FIFTEEN sex offenders were in the area on the day that shattered his le – before telling him they would only reopen the search for hernew evidence came to light. “To find that out,  years after the event,” he says. “I sat in a room with them and they showed me silhouette pictures of them.  “I know  sex offenders could cover a wide range of offences. But why were we kept in the dark about that  We’ve been let down since day one of the investigation. All I’ve ever wanted is truth and honesty, but I’ve not received that.” His former MP, who was with him at the meeting last December, was also flabbergasted at the RMP’s revelation. Now a retired Sgt Major, Richard, of Hartlepool, has made an emotionalto the village of Schloss Neuhaus, near Paderborn, Germany, to the place where his daughter was last seen – to “stir the embers” and keep the case fresh in people’s memories. It was November , , and Katrice, wearing red wellies and a purple coat, was standing with mum Sharon and aunt Wendy by the checkout at the store – now the site of a conference hall – near her dad’s Army base.  Sharon realised she had forgotten crisps for her birthday party and asked Wendy to watch the tot, but when she ed less than a minute later, Katrice was gone. Wendy told her she had run after her, and she thought they were together. Richard, who had driven them to the store – as big as a medium-sized Tesco – was waiting by his car. Forty years on, he looks around him, recalling the day his le stopped. “When they didn’t come out I went in. Sharon and her sister were in the manager’s office in tears. She told me, ‘Katrice is missing’. I grabbed some of my men and searched the area. “Then the Royal Military Police arrived. Those first few hours were critical – the ‘golden hours’ – but they didn’t even do the simple things like shut the shop and take names and addresses of everyone in there.  “They didn’t interview the women on the tills for six weeks. They questioned me and Sharon in separate rooms. They asked her ‘does Katrice like ducks ’. What two-year-old child doesn’t  In my mind that shows they’d made their mind up without investigating anything properly. “They assumed she’d fallen into the River Alme around  yards away. But it was busy around there. “The college had an open day and the garrison had just ed from a three-week exercise. There were hundreds of people around. Someone would have seen a toddler walking towards the river. Richard, who served in the th th King’s Royal Hussars for  years, firmly believes she was taken. And he has been clinging to hope for four decades.  “I don’t believe she went near the water. I believe she was abducted and is out there somewhere,” he says. “Someone has scooped her up, told her, ‘Let’s look for Mummy and Daddy’ to calm her – and then taken her. “She doesn’t know who she really is – but someone out there does. I will never give up looking for her. No parent would ever give up on their child. Over the years I’ve been to some dark places in my mind. And part of that is coming back here again. “It’s like walking back into any parent’s worst nightmare. I’m living that nightmare. There’s no closure. “I didn’t come here for all the agony and pain this place brings me. I’m here because Katrice is constantly on my mind and in my heart. “I passionately believe Katrice is out there. Hope never dies.”  And neither does Richard’s anger over the RMP investigation which has even astounded his former MP Mike Hill, who was with him at the meeting where the  sex offenders “in the area” at the time were mentioned. He said: “My impression was that it was around the vicinity of the NAAFI. That’s what went into my mind. It beggared belief. There were so many unanswered questions. They didn’t fill in the details. It was quite a deflating meeting for Richard, but I think after all these years he’d anticipated that. What he has been through is just horrendous.” In , a search along the banks of the Alme found bone fragments. Richard said Sharon, now his ex-we, and their older daughter, Natasha, , were “on tenterhooks” waiting for news – only for the RMP to post on social media that they were horse bones. He said: “They did that before informing the family. That shows how we’ve been treated.”  Earlier this month Boris Johnson agreed to meet Richard “father to father” to discuss the case, although a date has yet to be set. Richard said: “I want to speak to him about the treatment of my family.“I’d like to ask why the case has been scaled back  Every missing child needs to be treated equally.” The RMP has previously apologised for failings in its investigation, which included delays in interviewing key witnesses and not releasing a photofit of a suspect for  years. The MOD said: “A review of the investigation in  did not identy any new lines of inquiry. “The Lee family were briefed in person on its outcome and the decision to end active investigations.” Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ministry of DefenceBritish ArmyMilitary PoliceBoris JohnsonMissing personsSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Guests can stay for a bargain price at The Gardens, located in the heart of Manchesteraposs golden mile. This hotel is easy to miss as its inconspicuous doorway is sandwiched between an hodge-podge of shops on one of Manchester’s busiest pedestrian thoroughfares. The price of rooms starts at £ but that is for the hotelaposs lowest-grade option - the windowless room. Manchester Evening News reporter Diane Bourne spent £. to stay in an executive double room with a window for a night.She says she was pleasantly surprised at how nice her room was.  She wrote: Clearly very recently refurbished, it’s clean, bright and super stylish for a hotel very squarely positioned at the budget end of the market. The bathroom looked like it had only just been fitted, so spotless was every tile and crevice, with a pile of soft fluffy towels at my disposal. She added: And then, lo, inside the sleek black wardrobe was a plastic bag containing that most extra of hotel extras - a super-soft bathrobe and slippers to wear during your stay. My jaw was dropping to the floor at this point - I have to tell you - at the price Iaposd paid for such luxury.  The Gardens hotel is formed inside two merged textile warehouse buildings, the oldest dating back to , and it would later become the offices for the Manchester Corporation Tramways Department. The upper floors of the building were turned into a hotel in the late th century, while the ground level of the building became assorted shops. Old tiling can be seen on a second staircase and an old-fashioned metal lt is still in the older half of the hotel building.  Diane says she could hear the low hum of traffic when she walked into her room and thinks because the building is Grade II-listed that the single-pane windows at the front cannot be changed. She also says there is a Wetherspoons next door. She said she was only able to sleep for half an hour before police sirens woke her up around .pm.  The next morning, she decided to try the breakfast for an additional £.. Diane said: This also turned out to be a right old bargain.The full continental buffet included a little oven with baking pastries and pain au chocolat inside, there was fresh fruit and yoghurts and a coffee machine that spouted out a really delightful cappuccino, while a friendly waiter took my order for a fresh cooked breakfast.The Gardens hotel has a .-star rating out of five on Trip Advisor with many commenting on its great location and prices.

Jen Toll said she first began her alternative shopping method last year after seeing what her kids were really playing with during lockdown. The -year-old realised that her children didn’t care much about original packaging or the condition of the toys, so she decided to stick with second-hand shopping going forward, particularly as it saves money and is more environmentally -friendly.Jen, from Oxfordshire, said: We had a lot of time at home, of course, to play with toys rather than going out.  “I just felt that, given the state that they were in a lot of the time, they didnapost need to be brand new. “Iaposd always kind of done it but I really embraced it mid-, particularly also for my second daughter who was born in February . “I knew that she was going to have a lot of secondhand stuff anyway from her sister.” For Jen, the most important thing was being more sustainable. Along with her husband Ed Toll, , the pair focused on buying wooden toys, but they knew there would be some things their children wanted that would contain plastic, so they felt buying them second-hand was the best option.The mum said: “I felt that we just donapost need to keep creating more plastic. That was the number one reason.“Very closely tied with that was just how the kids treat the toys. “Iaposm not saying theyaposre constantly breaking them but when they do get played with, stuff does happen to them - theyaposre not always going to be pristine.”  Some of Jen’s best purchases last year were some fancy dress items, particularly as she knew her daughter was growing and they would quickly need to be replaced. She said: “She wanted everything from Star Wars to Elsa but each outfityou get it full price, is really expensive. “My daughter is five and a half but the height of a seven and a half-year-old, and I didn’t want to spend lots on outfits that would only last five minutes. “I focused on getting those second hand. “It was quite funny as getting the right size for her was tricky and we had to pretend Father Christmas had conveniently also got a second one in case the one in her stocking didn’t fit.” This year, the mum has picked up more fancy dress outfits, some talking cuddly toys for her youngest daughter who loves Shrek and even a den building kit for p. She said: “Most of it is in good condition and some of it is brand new as people sell on things that maybe just have never been played with or were bought as duplicate gts. “Some things do come with holes or stains and you just have to be prepared for that. “Last year we got one costume that smells really strongly of fabric conditioner and we never got rid of that smell.” As well as being more environmentally-friendly, Jen says she saves around -% on most gts by buying them secondhand. Know what you want before you start looking and be quite specic with your search terms. You might need to have the conversation around November time because sometimes it takes a little while to find the thing you want. Be patient. Have a look at the recommended retail price so you can know whether you really are saving some money. Look at location -you can get locally, it is going to save postage and of course, a carbon-emitting journey and travel time. The closer you can get it, the better. Askthe seller has got other items. If your child is really into something like they might be selling one thing, buttheir child is a bit older and growing out of something, they might have other things too. You might find something  that your child would particularly like. If you’re not sure of the item’s condition, share with the seller that you’re planning on giving it as a gt and ask them honestlythey think the condition is ok for that purpose. She said: “Sometimes you can get an even bigger bargain. If I take a lot of the outfits I bought last year, typicallytheyaposre new, youaposre looking at £ to £ pounds. I picked most of them up for around about £.” And Jen says her kids haven’t even noticed their toys aren’t brand new.  She added: “My kids are young enough that they have no ideatheyaposre brand new or not. “Within minutes, thereaposs something scratched so it really doesnapost make a dference. They certainly donapost know or indeed care as far as theyaposre concerned. Itaposs coming to them brand new. “When theyaposre a bit older, they might be able to tell and that might bother them but Iaposd like to think that actually, we can talk to them about the reason why buying secondhand is important and that they will embrace that at the time.”Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterAlthough saving money was never her main aim, Jen says it has helped her put a little more to towards experiences for the girls. She said: “Iaposm a psychologist and know that research does support that having stuff doesnapost make you happy and the boost to well-being when you get gts doesnapost last. “If Iaposm going to spend money, what Iaposd like to spend it on is experiences. “It might sound like Iaposm scrimping and saving but Iaposd much rather get much cheaper toys and bits and pieces and spend money on a ticket to go and see something in theatre, to go out for lunch or to go for a day out. “The studies support that spending money on experiences makes you and that person much happier than on actual stuff.” Comment MORE ON eBayToysChristmas shoppingParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The ft cone-shaped articial tree in the town cost North East Lincolnshire Council more than £,. Locals were baffled when the festive decoration was installed in Riverhead Square on Thursday and several people complained about it, with a resident claiming they had a bigger tree in their house.A person said: That is so embarrassing. Itaposs an insult to Grimsby. Another added: Itaposs a bit of a let down. Could have done better.Following criticism by residents, the Christmas tree was dismantled by contractors shortly before pm yesterday, Grimsby Live reports. Councillor Callum Procter issued a statement to explain why the tree was removed, claiming it was installed too early - and adding that a bigger one will be installed in the town next week. He said: There are great plans for celebrating the start of the Christmas period next week. Unfortunately, the Christmas Market tree was installed too early, and we understand that people were confused and thought this was our civic tree. The tree has been removed temporarily today and our contractors are reinstalling again, for free, ahead of the market next week. I’m looking forward to seeing people enjoying the illuminations, the market, and the revamped St Jamesapos Square with the civic tree and the special lighting on the Minster as part of the Christmas experience. The main Christmas tree will be situated in St Jamesapos Square from Monday, with the tree lights being switched on from pm on Thursday. A council spokeswoman said: There is no larger light up event this year as a Covid precaution.Earlier this month, people in a Merseyside village criticised their areaaposs festive display after their Christmas tree was replaced by one they say looks even worse.Blake Maynard, who lives in Birkdale village, Southport, in the borough of Sefton, took to a local Facebook group to rant about the tree earlier this month.After he compared the excuse of a Christmas tree to a beanstalk and another person askedit had been dragged out of the canal, Sefton Council agreed to replace it. However, it looked like the issue was not resolved as locals were still unhappy with the new display.

If you have a sudden or increased need to urinate throughout the night it could be a sign of prostate cancer. Nocturia is a condition that causes you to wake up during the night to urinate, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Severe nocturia has been found in  per cent of prostate cancer cases as a side effect of radiation treatment, studies have shown.The condition can also result from a tumour that is growing in size and pushing against the urethra, Thereports.  The Cleveland Clinic says: This can be thought of as nocturnal urinary frequency - having to urinate more often at night. Nocturnia typically occurs in the later stages of the disease, meaning treatments must start right away.The NHS notes that: “Prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis. Symptoms of prostate cancer can include needing to pee more frequently, often during the night. Early prostate cancer can be dficult to detect due to the lack of obvious symptoms. According to Prostate Cancer UK,you are aged  or over, your father or brother has had the disease, or you are black, you should speak to your GP. The drop in cancer screening rates during the Covid- could have repercussions for cancer survival in the coming years.There is overwhelming evidence that diet is a strong determinant of cancer.There is growing evidence that a plant-based diet may lower the risk of disease and slow its spread.Those who eat more fruits, vegetables, legumes and fish are less likely to see their cancer grow to the point of needing treatment, researchers have determined.These foods contain naturally occurring plant compounds, known as carotenoids, which could protect the body against DNA damage.Red-coloured fruits are particularly apt at protecting the body against cancer, due to their lycopene content, studies have found.Eating canned tomatoes slashed the risk of prostate cancer by  per cent in a  study published in Cancer Causes and Control. Prostate cancer is the second-most common form of disease among men after skin cancer. The disease is often labelled aggressive for its ability to spread quickly to neighbouring lymph nodes and organsleft untreated. Doctor Bradley McGregor, an oncologist with the Hard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said: The same dietary habits that can lower your risk of prostate cancer can have a similar effect to perhaps slowing its spread. So, no matter where you are in terms of prostate cancer - from monitoring PSA levels to treating a diagnosis - take the opportunity now to get serious about your diet.

But despite her previous frank revelations about their sex le Iris Mohamady, previously Jones, , said she and Mohamed, , simply toasted his arrival in the UK on Friday with “a cup of tea”. The retired care worker told the Sunday Mirror: “We didn’t celebrate – we are just together and that’s celebration enough. “We just had a cup of tea together. Mohamed is happy but he can’t say much at the moment. He’s one of those reserved Egyptians.”  Mohamed was granted a three-year visa on November  after he passed the required English language test and showed proof he was able to move in with Iris. She was shopping when he rang to tell her the good news. As Mohamed put his arm around her and kissed her on the head, she recalled: “There was a lot of happy shouting and screaming. I cried in Tesco while sorting out my fruit and vegetables. “My tears were dripping on the apples. It was amazing.”  She travelled by coach from her home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, to collect him from Heathrow. Speaking from her £, semi-detached bungalow, Iris said: “Three buses there and three back. We were worn out.”The couple first started chatting on a Facebook group for atheists in the summer of .They met in person the following November and wed in Cairo a year later.  But since December, their only contact has been phone or Facebook chats. Iris described their year apart as “awful”. She shot to fame last year when she told the Sunday Mirror about their sex le. Iris revealed they became romantic hours after meeting and said: “It was incredible. I felt like a virgin again. It wasn’t easy but it was very loving and romantic. “My ex-husband said I was frigid when we orced  years ago but I now know I’m certainly not.” Engineer Mohamed plans to find work in the UK. Iris said: “As for the future, who knows. It depends on how long I last.” The mum of two sons, Stephen, , and Darren, , said some relatives gave her the “silent treatment” after she married Mohamed. But she said: “We love each other.

A shortage of new consoles means many will have to use re-sale sites to get one. With  days to Christmas they are going for % more than the £ RRP – and that is set to soar as the big day looms.A global lack of microchips has left Brits scrambling to find stocks of Sony’s console and its Microsoft rival, the Xbox Series X.To make things worse, dealers – known as scalpers – wipe out online stocks before ordinary shoppers get a chance, then sell them at a huge profit. Some retailers limit orders to one console per user and run payment checks to prevent multiple buys.More than a million PSs have been sold in the UK since last November. While they were back in stock last week at Argos, Curry’s and Smyths Toys, other retailers such as Amazon and Tesco had sold out.Andy Robertson, editor of the askaboutgames website, urged PS fans not to panic-buy.He said: “I appreciate it’s the ‘must have’ gt.

The monarch has had to pull out of a string of public events in recent weeks, including a scheduled appearance at the Cop climate summit in Glasgow and the Remembrance Sunday ceremony, due to a back sprain. But The Sun newspaper has reported that she is planning to attend as the second cousins are baptised on Saturday at All Saints Chapel in Great Windsor Park, Berkshire.It is understood she will take a decision on the day and consult with her personal doctor in advance.

Click here to sign up A royal source said: “Her Majesty is very keen to be there as she knows how important this is for her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It’s set to be a heartwarming family occasion and a time of real celebration after what has been some challenging times for certain royals of late, including the Queen herself. “She is keen to attend such a wonderful event after the great personal disappointment of missing last Sunday’s Remembrance events.” It is thought tomorrow is the first time members of the Royal Family will have been baptised together.  Princess Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank’s son August was meant to be christened in July before the event was cancelled due to Covid. He will be baptised alongside Lucas Philip, the son of Mike and Zara Tindall, born in March. The ceremony will be led by Canon Martin Poll, who is chaplain to Great Windsor Park and will take place at the private Grade-II listed church which forms part of the Royal Lodge house.

Avid bargain-hunters were seen queuing up with camping chairs and blankets from pm ahead of the Bury shop opening its doors at am on Friday.Advertising from The Range promised the first  customers through the door would receive a gt bag with prizes worth over £, to celebrate the th store, reported the Manchester Evening News.But shoppers were left disappointed with some only receiving gts that they valued at just £ or £.  The Range has since explained that the total value of prizes and gt cards given away to the first  customers was £,. A spokesperson for the store claimed there were still a lot of satisfied customers and that the first three people in line won big prizes including £ vouchers, a hot tub, a kayak and a paddle board. But, others who had waited through the night for the doors to open were less pleased. Emma Louise said: We were promised a £, grand prize I got there at am with good faith that I was going to win. Waited four hours, spent so much money on hot drinks to stay warm.  Finally, I received my bag, it had a pack of pencils inside, a bath bubble, a moisturiser, a bag of chocolates and gt card. When I spoke to the woman I asked her how much was on it and got told it would be between £ and £. Went to the till and the women said I had won ‘’ I said aposwhat £apos she goes no apos£apos! I was so upset not only did I waste my time, I wasted my money on £ taxi to get down and £ on hot drinks to stay warm. Feel very let down. Another shopper said: In the bag there was a bottle of bubble bath, body lotion, a trolley coin, bag of chocolate, out of date edible cake decorations, packet of pencils, cup cake cases, Minky cleaning pad, and a gt card which we had to take to a till to find out the value, we and everybody around us had a fiver in it. It was obvious they had worded the press release in a way to make it look like it was worth queuing for so they had nice pictures. I was there for am but there were one or two people who had been out all night. I just hope they got one of the decent prizes promised! The Range said over  shoppers queued for the new store - the th Range branch in the UK. A statement from The Range read: Three excited shoppers who had stayed outside of the store overnight bagged themselves a goody bag with a £ gt card to spend in store and amazing spot prizes. First through the doors was -year-old Claire Chapman who received a Lay-Z Spa hot tub. Ryan Wright, , who was second in the queue, received Kayak and sail, while the third person in the queue, -year-old Tracey Kerr, received a stand-up paddle board. All of the first  shoppers through the doors received a goody bag which contained gt cards ranging from £-£ and spot prizes which included love to shop vouchers, drill sets, door mats, art deco bin, electric heater and lots more household goodies. The total value of prizes and gt cards given away to the first  customers was £,.

Every time we passed a public convenience she had to pop in and spend a penny. Because, mum said, she didn’t want to get caught short in Mac Fisheries or be bursting for a wazz in Woolworths. So, of course, I am now a preemptive piddler too. AndI pass a public lav when I’m out I’ll pay a visit “just in case”. But it irritates friends who know that I can easily hold on until we reach the cafe or pub and use the Ladies there. Because I am not constrained by the dreaded “urinary leash” that causes misery for millions of elderly, disabled and vulnerable people. The people tied to their own homes by a fear of being caught short and the nationwide shortage of loos. Councils are not legally obliged to provide public toilets, so many have now closed theirs to save cash. In the past six years numbers have fallen by  per cent, and now a survey has revealed that one in five Brits fear leaving home because of their bladder issues. Some people who could wait don’t bother trying though – they just relieve themselves in the streets and people’s gardens. Then there’s “flypeeing” where people widdle in bottles or coffee cups and lob them out of car windows. The Royal Society for Public Health calls the dwindling number of public loos “a health and mobility inequality we cannot afford to ignore”. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter And the British Toilet Association is campaigning for them to be kept open as part of the drive to reinvigorate our high streets and support local shops and traders. Because how can you expect people to splash the cash when there’s nowhere in town to spend a penny  We Brits are famous for our lavatorial humour. But the shortage of public conveniences now facing this country is no laughing matter. And we have to protect our right to carry on at our convenience. The BTA’s “Use Our Loos” campaign is urging businesses to make their toilets accessible to the local community and for shops, cafes and bars to let people use theirs for free. They are also supporting the Great British Toilet Map, a database to help you find the nearest ones, and to link existing community toilet schemes across the country. One of those is an “Age Friendly” project, where shops display logos offering older people wee stops. It’s in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where I grew up. And my mum would be simply delighted.

Earlier this week, Martin narrowly avoided being sent to jail for punching her to the floor during an argument last year.The -year-old woman described the dad-of-seven as a real danger to women in her victim impact statement, reports the DailyPost. Ellie shared pictures of the injuries Martin inflicted on her which were shown in court this week and told how Martinaposs abuse left her a shadow of the person she once was.She said: I was made to fear for my le the night I was attacked. Anthony kept shouting things at me, the one that sticks in my mind is: ‘If you scream, Iaposll finish the job,’ whilst standing over me holding my crying baby, who had woke from the noise.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I couldn’t call for help because I didn’t know what would have happened next. I don’t know what would have happened to my baby, and the thought of him growing up without a mummy hurts alone. The unprovoked attack still haunts me to this day and something which I think will haunt me forever. Being forced to stay quiet in my own home, whilst in so much pain.Earlier this week, Martin - of Llugwy Road in Kinmel Bay, north-east Wales - admitted two counts of common assault, along with cultivating cannabis plants and siphoning electricity. He was handed a -month suspended sentence, ordered to carry out  hours unpaid work and to complete an anger management course. A letime restraining order was imposed to protect Ellie, who is also from Kinmel Bay. But choking back tears, she questioned how he could have got off so lightly and admitted sheaposd lost faith in the justice system.  I feel totally let down...and I will not continue to be silent like I have been made to be for the past  months, she said. Ellie explained how she saw outbursts of anger and abusive behaviour within months of their relationship. She said: The attack wasn’t the first, I cannot forgive myself for not screaming for help that night or months before then when I noticed Anthony’s controlling nasty behaviour. Truth be told, I honestly believed this man was capable of killing me as he threatened to do so countless times over the months of knowing him. Therefore I was far too scared of him to do anything about it. He had no care about anyone other than himself.  Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. After she was punched by Martin, Ellie went to Glan Clwyd hospital to have her right eye examined. Doctors confirmed she had suffered a cracked nasal wall which had left her with an eye haemorrhage. As a result, she needed specialist treatment at Abergele Eye Hospital. I was struggling mentally at the time in facing up to what had happened, I hated what I had become - a victim and absolute shadow of the person I was before, she admitted. After several appointments, Ellie was referred to her doctor after persistent numbness in her right cheek and stinging sensations in her eye. She was told that it was very unlikely that she would ever fully regain the feeling back in her face and that over time it may only get worse. She added: I will continue to fight to get better for the sake of my son because he deserves the best mum I can be. Never will I forget this bad memory, I think it’s going to have an effect on me forever, it changed me from the person I once was. The physical reminder I have will forever be there due to his actions, which is something I find really dficult to live with.

And all owners of hunting trophies – such as lion skins, tusks, antlers, heads and other macabre souvenirs – would have to register or face jail.The changes, proposed in a Bill, come after legislation promised by PM Boris Johnson two years ago has failed to appear.Labour MP John Spellar’s plan is supported by celebrities and across the political ide, including by Tory MPs.Hunters can import trophies of animals, including polar bears and reindeer, ­under a limited number of Government licences.The Hunting TrophyBill would make importing threatened or vulnerable species an offence, with culprits facing up to seven years in jail.  It would bring trophy smuggling into line with laws covering the import of ivory from elephants and rhino. Mr Spellar said: “It’s time for action, not words. We need to make sure that these sick imports are stopped and the only way to do that is to make it a crime.” Actress Dame Judi Dench said the Government should back the Bill to show its “determination to ban animals being senselessly slaughtered for souvenirs.”  Downton Abbey star Peter Egan said: “Wildle can’t wait any more. “Every year that goes by without this ban in place means ­hundreds more animals are killed just for kicks.” The private members’ bill is likely to need Government support to become law.

The ads for “Trophy Hunting Holidays” mock real offers marketed by the trophy hunting industry.

Anne Harrison, , was left at St Cross Hospital in Rugby in Warcs. after her mum, who came from Barbados, fell pregnant and was unable to look after her.The baby was placed in an orphanage and later a white couple offered to foster her, CoventryLive reports.Anne soon realised she was dferent in school because of her skin colour and was taunted and bullied by her peers. She said: It wasnapost until I started going to school that I realised I was dferent.  I had dferent skin and I was taunted and teased and children called me bad names. My white foster carers didnapost treat me dferently to any member of the family. They used to tell me to ignore the kids at school, but within the family, I was treated as one of them. Anneaposs foster parents emigrated to Australia when she was nine and she was moved to a childrenaposs home. At , Anne received the shocking news that she had a younger brother living in a separate childrenaposs home.  She said: When I was about  or , the authorities were informed by the police that my mum likely had a breakdown and was at the hospital. She told the police officers that she had a son who lived in Berkshire at the time, and she had a daughter as well, which was me. We were both in dferent childrenaposs homes. Fortunately, weaposre both very close and we see each other on a regular basis. Anne started to look for her mum when she was . Anneaposs mother would write letters to her but refused to meet her children in person. One day, Anne made a trip to London to seeher mother was at one of the old addresses she was writing from - but she wasnapost there. Anne decided to focus on her career but still kept searching for her mother. That same year, when Anne was  she began working as a police cadet for Warwickshire Police and left the childrenaposs home to live in provided accommodation by the police force.  At , Anne was a working police officer and after three years in the force, she decided to leave to become a social worker starting in Stratford, East London and then moved to Coventry. She said: When I first came to Coventry I would very rarely see another black person. I was so confused about how to look after my hair, how to deal with my skin, were there any other people who looked like me. I was brought up in a white household, my foster parents were white.  The childrenaposs home was predominantly white, being in the police force was predominantly white. I was one of the first black police cadets in Warwickshire. In her late s, Anne was able to locate her mum. She agreed to meet Anne and they set up a date to see each other for the first time. Anne says she was overwhelmed when she met her mother for the first time. Anne said: I was a little overwhelmed. It was like looking at a mirror of myself, but it was emotional.

Nicola Rooney, , from Birkenhead, Merseyside, had been waiting  days for a Remington shaver to arrive - a surprise gt for her partner Tank, .As the days went on and the parcel didnapost appear, she contacted the online retailer, Studio, to ask about the hold up.She told the Liverpool Echo : I ordered a £ Remington shaver for my husband and was wondering where it was, because it doesnapost take  days to get here.When I contacted Studio they said it had been delivered. I checked with Hermes and they had a picture of it just on the doorstep. I never received this, it was clear from the picture I didnapost receive it. Nicolaapos says she was disgusted because it was obvious that they left it while knowing no one was there to sign for it. She said: It is disgusting. You can clearly see in the picture no one was there to take the parcel, they usually have photos of a delivery showing the door open, but this is obviously closed. It is really frustrating because we live on the corner and everyone can just see it. It has completely ruined Christmas for him [Tank] because there is no surprise. Nicola says Studio agreed to refund the money and send a new shaver. She added: It is the principle of the matter. I have seen similar things like this happen to others. Something needs to be done, Hermes has a duty of care, they should be named and shamed. I am lucky, it wasnapost massively valuable and I have had a refund. But it could have been something very expensive so to just dump it is unacceptable, they are not taking any pride in this. A spokesperson for Hermes said: We have been in contact with Ms Rooney to apologise for any inconvenience and provide her with a full refund so that she can order another shaver in time for Christmas. This is a very busy time of year and our local couriers are working hard to deliver, so we would ask that people try to be at home when expecting a delivery or choose an alternative service such as deliver to a neighbour or ParcelShop where available. Anyone experiencing delivery issues should contact their retailer or seller in the first instance, who will in turn contact Hermesrequired.

Equality and ersity lead Rima said: “My main goal was to add storage as my home didn’t have a lot of it. “We made a DIY pantry area in the kitchen and added fitted wardrobes in our bedroom which perfectly fit into the alcoves.  “I also wanted to add ling in almost every room, however we wanted to do this ourselves to save cost and be under budget.“We learnt how to do it from Instagram tutorials and it’s honestly one of the most proudest achievements we have done with the house.”The couple said that, while they didn’t want to do a major renovation or throw too much money at the property as they don’t consider it their “forever home”, they were determined to give it a fresh makeover that better suited their tastes.  They set about decorating in November , painting the walls in neutral tones, ripping up the carpet to let the wooden floor breath, and adding ling to the walls for a touch of glamour. The couple also experimented with other DIY tasks including creating a makesht pantry in a small corner of their kitchen, which they led, painted white and then screwed on some rustic-style shelves purchased from eBay. Also in the kitchen, they made DIY shaker-style cabinets. They purchased MDF wood cut to their specications that cost £, and then fitted them.They also created a DIY Crittall-style shower screen for £ by painting the frame black using a £ tester pot, then using a mm vinyl tape she bought from eBay for £ and cut to , sticking it on the glass. For extra precision, she used a spirit level. To furnish the home, they scoured Facebook Marketplace for second-hand furniture.Rima estimates each room in the house took between - weeks to complete – with the couple usually working on them during the weekends. They did all of the work themselves, aside from fitting their wardrobes, which they hired professionals to do.  Rima said: “The most dficult part was the painting – we have high ceilings and we found it to be draining at times, but it was worth it. “We live in a fairly old house so wall cracks appeared which were dficult, but we have accepted that some of it adds to the character.” In total, the couple have spent £, on the renovations – including the cost of the fitted wardrobes. Now, the couple are focusing on transforming the two spare bedrooms and giving the hallway a mini makeover. Rima added: “I have come to the conclusion that I will always have some decorating to do. “But my husband has been my partner in DIY and I wouldn’t have been able to execute half of the ideas or plans without him – he truly is a gem.” Rima claimed the house value has increased by £, already and that she anticipates it being worth even more once fully finished.

She says the roomaposs window was cracked and there was a hole in the ceiling with a bin underneath. Leanne told the ECHO: Me and my little sister have both worked right the way through the pandemic. She works days and I work nights and sheaposs been helping me look after my little boy. So to say thank you I wanted to book her and her partner a little getaway.  We live in Norfolk now but are from Liverpool and have family here so I thought it would be nice for them to come back to our home city. Originally I was going to book the Dolby hotel but I thought it would be out the way, so I changed my mind and booked the Adelphi instead because itaposs right in town and everything is close. She arrived on Monday and was put in one room but the window was all cracked and there was a hole in the ceiling with a bin under it. The bin was covered with water as though there had been a leak and was also covered with rubbish.  In the bathroom, the towel rail was off the wall and just sat on the floor. They went to complain and they were given another room which was smaller but just as bad. After complaining about the state of the second room, the couple were given a new room. Leanne added: The window was all cracked and the bed linen was so dirty. This was all on the first day and she was put in another room. I FaceTimed her that night and she didnapost look happy at all. Outside the room, there were holes in the ceiling.  I rang the hotel myself and the sht manager said he would sort another room out. They were taken to another floor and on the corridor, there were care packages left outside of doors which made her panic people were quarantining. The manager said thataposs just how they would do things now after Covid. Another thing they do because of Covid is use paper cups. So my sister went down to get a paper cup and was given one with a lid on.  When she got back to her room she took the lid off to use it and it was absolutely filthy. It was f*****g disgusting, just minging. She then went back to the main desk for a clean one and they apologised and said it must have gotten mixed up. How can it get mixed up when itaposs a paper cup and should be thrown straight in the bin. It looked like someone had just had soup out of it. Leanne says that despite several attempts to contact Britannia Hotels, who own the Adelphi Hotel, she has had no response to complaints made. She said: What was meant to be five nice, peaceful days away were just horric. It used to be a good hotel. Iaposve since been looking at the reviews and they all say what my sister went through.

He also said he is hurt to get updates on his grandchildren through interviewsMeghan Markle took part in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres this week Image: The Ellen ShowByPatrick Hill:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsMeghan Markle’s dad says he squirmed as he watched her latest TV interview... and dismissed it as a “stupid stunt”. Thomas Markle Sr admitted he tuned in with trepidation.But he wasn’t prepared for the -minute cringe-fest in which Prince Harry ’s we goofed around with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.Thomas, , told the Sunday Mirror: “It’s no way to behave. The whole thing was kind of embarrassing. It was certainly embarrassing for the Royal Family. “It’s embarrassing for her as well. I suspect it embarrassed everyone in the UK, too. “She’s putting herself out there as a duchess but I’ve never seen a duchess behave this way, doing stupid stunts.”  Thomas said he felt wounded and disappointed that Meghan spoke of her struggles for success – without acknowledging his support. He also said:He is “hurt” the chat is his only update on grandchildren Archie, two, and Lilibet, five months. It reminded him of Meghan as a teething tot who “cried and cried”. Meghan was wrong to claim she struggled by using a dodgy car while finding acting work. Harry should get a job as “all he seems to do is ride his bike”. Believes the couple should join the Royal Family over Christmas. “Bad tempers” had driven him and Meghan apart but he still hopes a reunion will happen.Thomas, a retired Hollywood lighting director, winced at home in Mexico as Meghan took part in a skit which saw her do squats and say daft things at a market stall. She wore a hidden earpiece and had to obey commands from US host Ellen while out in public.  The Duchess, , was directed to touch trays of crystals and claim they had “good energy”, hold a giant one to her head and chant incomprehensibly before telling a stunned worker: “I have healing powers. Can you feel my powers ” At a vinegar stall, Meghan also followed orders as Ellen told her to say: “Let mummy taste some. My booloves hot sauce.” The Duchess bounced while she waited for a taste of the sauce, before shoving a crisp into her mouth in fast bites after Ellen told her to devour it “like a chipmunk”. Meghan pulled out a baby bottle and sucked on the teat as shocked stall-workers watched. And she acted like a cat after being told to wear dress-up ears. Back in the studio, in front of a packed audience, Meghan talked of being a struggling actress in her s, doing auditions at a Los Angeles studio. She said her car had faulty doors that meant she had to climb in and out via the boot.  However, there was no mention of her dad, who says he supported her both financially and professionally throughout her childhood and fledgling career. Thomas said he even helped pull strings to get her a union card so she could find work. He said: “I’m disappointed she didn’t mention me. I hooked her up with a director on the General Hospital TV show and that got her a couple of lines on one of the shows which got her a union card. It’s really dficult to get a job without a card so that was crucial. I paid for the card too. I’ve been disappointed all this hasn’t been acknowledged.” Contradicting what Meghan said about her car, Thomas said: “The Ford Explorer she had in her early s that she mentioned was a good running vehicle. I don’t remember any time she had to crawl out of the back of it to get out, like she said. “The doors worked fine on that vehicle until the day she got rid of it.” The Ellen show saw Meghan hand out copies of her children’s book The Bench to audience members, while a picture flashed up on screen of her showing Archie feeding chickens while wearing jeans, T-shirt and yellow Peppa Pig Hunter wellies.Thomas has read the book and is unimpressed, saying: “That book is not for children. No child would read or understand that book. “That is an adult’s book, it’s for her husband. No kid would be interested. The only thing interesting for a kid in that book is the picture of the dog on the cover.” Meghan, referring to the TV host as “Auntie Ellen”, also told of Archie dressing up as a dinosaur for Halloween, while Lilibet was a skunk. The anecdotes were bitter-sweet for Thomas, who has not met either of them. It also triggered memories of a young Meghan. Thomas said: “Archie’s a very handsome young boy and I look forward to seeing him in person. And also Lili, who I have also not seen. Meghan liked dressing up for Halloween when she was little, so I’m not surprised she mentioned how Lili dressed as a skunk this year.  “There’s a picture of Meghan, aged six or so, with a pumpkin outfit on. It was funny to hear Meghan talking about Lili teething. Meghan was just the same when she was that age. “She’d be crying and crying and crying. Doria and I would carry her around to calm her down. We’d keep things in the refrigerator she could suck on to sooth her, too, and eventually she got over it.” Thomas and Meghan fell out after he colluded with a US photo agency to stage shots of him preparing for her wedding. In the end, he did not attend. When a letter from Meghan to her father was leaked she sued a newspaper for breach of privacy and won. But at an appeal hearing this month Meghan apologised for not telling a judge about emails showing her attempts to influence a book about her and Harry. Meghan, who shot to fame in legal drama Suits, wed Harry, , in . But in February the couple stepped down as senior Royals. They moved to Meghan’s native Calornia, where they are working on big-money projects, including a £million deal to make Netflix films.The Ellen interview was eight months after her and Harry’s TV chat with Oprah Winfrey, in which she said a royal made a racist remark about Archie’s skin tone. Thomas said he wasn’t surprised by Meghan saying Harry had taken to the US lestyle – but he said his son-in-law should “get a job delivering newspapers” as “all he seems to do is ride his bike”. And he added he “feels sorry” for the Queen because Harry and Meghan are reportedly not going to the UK at Christmas. He said: “Harry should go, without a doubt. This might be the last chance he gets to see his grandmother. I really feel bad for her, they have treated her so poorly and been so rude. I have great respect for the Queen and the Royal Family.” Despite his withering verdict, Thomas hopes he can patch things up with Meg. He said: “Sooner or later I do think as a family we are going to get together. “It’s sort of ridiculous we can’t and it’s all down to bad tempers. But for an old man I’m doing OK. I’ve got a bad heart, but I am doing all right. “Before the wedding she made speeches around the world, for the UN and so on, and said there ‘should be more men like my dad’. So at that point we were in a good place, but it all went downhill when she met Harry.” Comment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleOprah WinfreyEllen DeGeneresRoyal FamilyChristmas partySunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: The Sun   News LicensingByMilo BoydNews Reporter:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov A photo of Prince Andrew grinning joyfully is on display in Jeffrey Epsteinaposs mansion, it has been reported. The picture reportedly sits behind a framed photo of the billionaire paedophile in the Palm Beach, Florida home where he was accused of abusing victims. The -year-old royal appears to be wearing military unorm in the snap. Andrew has denied making visits to the house, despite witnesses claiming he spent weeks there at a time.“Epstein cultivated powerful friends and would show them off in pictures around all of his homes, a source told The Sun.“This is incredibly damaging for Prince Andrew because it shows how highly Jeffrey prized his friendship with a senior member of the Royal Family.  “His picture was shown off in Jeffrey’s home like a trophy. Epstein, who killed himself in prison in  aged , bought his six-bedroom Palm Beach home for £ million in . It is located near ex-US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. Other photos inside the home include Epstein posing in a matching kilt with Andrew’s friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is seen on a motorbike in another snap.  The British socialite is awaiting trial for allegedly aiding the ­billionaire’s sex-trafficking ring. She is set to enter the dock on November  over charges of sex ­trafficking a minor, sex trafficking conspiracy and grooming a -year-old girl to engage in sexual acts with Epstein from  to . She has maintained her innocence since her arrest in July last year and has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Andrew has also found himself engaged in a legal wrangle.  Earlier this year, Virginia Giuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein, began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. She alleges she was told by Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the Prince at Epsteinaposs mansion in New York and at other locations. The prince has continually denied the allegations and said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting herEarlier this month, a judge said Andrew should be prepared for a trial late next year. Speaking in a teleconference, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said he anticipated the trial on Ms Giuffre’s civil claims would begin between September and December . Andrew has distanced himself from Epstein following his death in .Days after giving a memorable interview to Newsnight, Andrew sensationally quit public le for the foreseeable future and said that it had become clear to him that my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work.He expressed sympathy for the victims of the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier, saying he hoped they could rebuild their lives. He said: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives.

But now one woman has caused serious confusion as she witnessed her woolly hat changing colour right in front of her eyes.Interior designer Otelia Carmen shared a video to her TikTok account@oteliacarmenwhere she said: So, I bought this green hat at the store today and I brought it home and when I took it out, I was like: ‘Why is this brown ’Then realised: metamerism. This is why lighting is so important in interior design.” Metamerism is the colour change seen in a coloured item because of dferent spectral emissions from dferent light sources.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Basically, each light source has its own “colour”, so when it’s projected onto a coloured surface, it impacts the colour of that surface. In Otelia’s case, the lighting is what makes the hat look green in the shop, as when she got home, the hat appeared to be red. Even in her own home, the hat changed colours from a dark brick red when she was standing in the dining room to green when she walked into the bedroom. So, she took the hat outside to see what colour it was in the light of day, and it was in fact, brown. Since being posted, the two videos have racked up a total of six million views, and thousands of comments from “mind-blown” viewers. One person said: “Just gonna scroll [because] I donapost have time to think right now.”  Another wrote: “I truly thought it was going to be about being colourblind but now Iaposm just confused.” A third commented: “It’s the dress all over again.” “Imagine having an outfit that you prepare and suddenly your hat changes colour and ruins the whole outfit,” added someone .Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Matthew, , got sick of friends and family commenting on his balding head and decided to get a transplant from hair company Novo Cabelo, as the Daily Star reports. He then visited Ottoman Traditional Turkish Barber in Richmond, Yorkshire, where a TikTok video was made of the change, which was shared to their account @novocabelohair.Now Matthew is being constantly praised for his new hair, with many saying heaposs gone from looking like he was in his late s to early s.What do you think about Matthewaposs incredible transformation  Let us know in the comments...In the TikTok video, the stylist from Novo Cabelo measures the spot on his head that will be covered by the new hair system, and draws directly onto the material. The scalp is then protected with a special treatment and the glue is applied before the hair system is pressed down onto his scalp. Next, the hair is cut and styled so it matches with his natural hair and the end result is incredible. Rob, from Novo Cabelo, told the Daily Star: Matthew is  and was sick of his friends and family telling him to aposjust shave it offapos. He didn’t want to be bald. So he found us on TikTok and booked an appointment. The reaction was so positive. People were commenting how much younger he looked. Rob said his client is now more confident than before and just loves having hair again. He said people reckoned he looked  years younger thanks to the new head of hair glued onto his scalp. The video has been liked hundreds of times and people in the comments were full of praise for the handiwork. One user wrote: Big dference he looked mid-forties in the original. That easily took  years off him. Someone  said theyaposd be well up for trying this and another simply commented: Youaposre amazing.

Now, villagers nearby can hear the noise tooResidents in nearby Stapleton can hear the noise too Image: GoogleByNick DawsonChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov | commentsA strange noise that has been bothering villagers for a year can now be heard from people living miles away too. Residents in Earl Shilton, Leicestershire, said the low-frequency droning sound has become louder in recent weeks. Now Brian Heath, who lives in nearby Stapleton, said the sound can be heard from there too.He told Leicestershire Live : It’s quite a heavy noise. It makes your body vibrate, the air is moving so much. It’s very low level, but you can feel the pressure on your body.It’s a weird noise, it could be drilling, driving through rock.I used to work for British Gas, we used to get a lot of tunnel boring. It’s a very deep sound. It’s there all the time. Brian said the noise does not bother him much, but he can hear it even while watching TV. Ange Redshaw, who lives in nearby Barwell, said the strange sound can be heard  hours a day, even over traffic noise, and at night a vibration can be felt while lying on the pillow. Local resident Robert Elsey, director of PESLimited, an engineering firm based in Burbage, suggested the source of the peculiar noise may be a noisy transformer. He explained: My company installs acoustic enclosures and walls around and in front of transformers to reduce noise affecting local neighbourhoods. We worked on a similar project about three years ago, noise from a large transformer made items inside a house vibrate. Another person suggested the sound may be related to an electrical issue, as they said: With the description of the noise being constant, pulsating and humming, this most likely points to it being an EMIissue, as it matches the characteristics of electricity. Similar to a dodgy light dimmer switch etcyou have ever heard one. Severn Trent Water and Western Power Distribution told Leicestershire Live they were not aware of any issues in the area and they had not received any reports about the noise.

But one woman was left “mortied” after her date sent her an insulting text about her. The woman, named Meag, was due to meet up with a guy she met on the dating app Hinge when he made a major slip-up. The pair were setting up plans for their date when the guy accidentally sent Meag a message that was meant for his mate - andthat’s not awkward enough, it was about her.She shared screenshots of the text exchange on her TikTok account@uhmeaging , in a video which she captioned: “@hinge where is my refund  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.

But when she received the package she got quite a shock. Instead of the aposfabulousapos bushy tree that she was expecting, she claims she opened the parcel to find a single branch.  Paulette posted a picture of a sad-looking branch on her sofa on Facebook, where she wrote: I ordered a ft Christmas tree and that’s what I got. I contacted the company and they said they sent me a tree like for like. They mustaposve taken a twig off the tree and thought I would be happy.According to Deadline News, Paulette had wanted to make this Christmas extra special as her partner is going into hospital to have brain surgery.She told the publication that once sheaposd purchased the item, the money came straight out of her account and she also received an email with her tracking number. But it turns out it might not have even been the right tracking number, she said, as Hermes claimed they had delivered the tree even though she never received it. Uakie has yet to issue Paulette a full refund. The store has also removed Christmas trees from its website. Uakie has been contacted for comment.

The creature was born at a farmeraposs house in Bhagirathpura in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. The unique-looking calf drew plenty of attention, with witnesses deeming it a ine miracle. The cow can drink milk from both of its mouths and is believed to be completely healthy. Intrigued by the calf, the farm is reportedly crowded with visitors flocking to worship it. In a video taken of the sweet creature, the calf can be seen standing on all fours and walking unsteadily as it becomes familiar with its home.  It also enjoys a cuddle with its owner at one point, nestled in the farmeraposs arms. In a further clip, people can be seen coming to take pictures with the famous calf, bending down to pose next to it. This is not the first time a rare calf is born in India. Only last month, a calf with two heads and three eyes was born in Bijapara village of Nabarangpur district in Odisha.  Earlier this year, a two-headed calf was born in Lazec, North Macedonia. The calf has fused skulls, two pairs of eyes, two mouths, one pair of ears, and sucks milk simultaneously with two mouths. Farmer Vasko Pestrovski said: Early in the morning we heard that the cow was about to deliver. When she delivered, we saw the calf was rather extraordinary, with two heads.  We immediately called on the veterinarian, he came and said it was a was a very natural phenomenon. The calf is ing normally. I will keep it as long as it is alive, no matter how long. We will do everything to ensure this.  Veterinarian Dr. Alaina Macdonald explained: The rare development of two-headed offspring is directly related to the formation of identical twin embryos early in the pregnancy.There is no way to truly know how often this occurs, as this event would generally result in the early loss of pregnancy, and those pregnancies often are undetected. Indeed, it is exceptionally rare for the embryo to develop into a full-term fetus, and to survive theof the gestation. It is not considered an inherited trait, because the offspring almost never live to reproductive age.

Thirteen magnicent beasts are about to jostle for position amid a cacophony of squealing car tyres and honking horns. Yes, the World Cup may be coming to these parts this time next year. But in Qatar, most locals are obsessed with the ancient sport of camel racing. The fiercely contested sport has its own TV channel to give fans a daily taste of the action. I’m at the Al Shahaniyah racetrack, where there are thousands upon thousands of camels, as far as the eye can see, in early morning training. Some cost in excess of £million. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  Horse racing may be popular in the UK but camel racing here is more like a religion. And the beasts of burden no longer have human riders on board. After an international outcry – some jockeys were as young as four – riders were banned in . Nowadays robotic devices weighing barely lbs are tied to the saddle and can be remote controlled. Trainers can use the whip, reins and even speak and encourage the beasts through a microphone.The camels hurtle around the sandy track at speeds of mph. But they are followed on a perimeter road by a convoy of cars as the trainers use walkie talkies to control their animals. It’s like a scene from a desert car rally. As soon as dawn breaks, the camels begin to emerge from their stables. One by one, they cross the busy main dual carriageway on special camel crossings where they have priority over cars. Yet more proof that in Qatar, the camel is King. Or, perhaps more accurately, Queen – as most racing camels are female.  I meet Al Mansouri Mubarak, , who is sitting apprehensively in his expensive SUV with his -year-old son Mansour. He has  camels – all on special diets – and his next race is at .am, before the heat of the day can set in. “My father owned camels, I owned camels and now my son will,” he said. It ’s a fantastic sport – just look at all the people here taking part.” He stopped speaking as his camel was moved into the stalls. The field came under starters orders and suddenly they were “off.” There was a thunder of hooves and the ground shook like a minor earthquake as the magnicent creatures came rattling past us.  Mubarak screeched off into the distance following his beloved camel, urging it on to victory. Beside him a dozen cars jostled for position as the owners vied for the best place to watch their respective camels. Now the screech of tyres and wails of horns kicks in as the full drama of the race unfolds. Braik al Malarke, , has five camels and paid a whopping £, for one of them last year.  “I don’t have a camel racing today – I’ve just come to check out the opposition,” he smiled. “I’m looking at the other owners’ camels to seeI would like mine to race theirs in upcoming races.” The sport is organised by the Hejen Racing Committee. Just like in horse racing, each camel has its own number and colours. And, in similar fashion, they are loaded in the stalls ready for the off. A big screen – just like at Cheltenham, Aintree or Ascot – shows the race as it progresses to the watching stable lads cheering their respective animals on. A commentator gives an impassioned description of each race asit’s as important as the Gold Cup or the Grand National.  Races – typically over six, eight or  kilometres –are organised according to a camel’s age and size. And as well as the heaving morning events there is a second session in the evening. Another owner, who asked not to be named, said: “It is a fiercely competitive sport and the camels are treated very well.  “I know horse racing is the sport of Kings in England and other parts of the world, but here camel racing is our traditional sport that goes back centuries. There is one satellite TV channel that shows the races and also programmes on the camels and how they are trained.” Then he said: “The football World Cup comes here next year but it takes place in the camel racing season and that will continue, obviously. “Nothing will get in the way of our camel racing.” Comment MORE ON Grand NationalGold CupHorsesFestivalsFIFA World CupSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The beast chased miniature crossbreed Bonya before walking away over the snow with the animal clenched in its teeth - but parents are fearful for their children. Another dog - a pug - was also devoured by a wolf in the same town, Olenegorsk, Russia as reports emerged of a pack of predators stalking a school. Local officials have ordered hunters to kill a pack of wolves holding the Arctic community under siege. Yulia Mekhnina, , a mother-of-two, demanded of local mayor Oleg Samarsky: “Our dog was killed by a wolf. “Today it also killed a pug… We found the remains of our dog about  metresfrom the railway track, in the park. “Whatthose were children  What do we have to do now ” Video footage taken in the neighbourhood shows the moment a hungry wolf grabs the tiny pooch before the pack moved on to its next victim.  Another local woman Lesya Gennadyeva posted: “What a nightmare. “The wolf was actually hunting in the town, something needs to be done urgently. “There is a kindergarten there. God forbid, whatthis was a child in its teeth. “I am terried to imagine.” Yulia’s husband Dmitry told how he followed wolf footprints in the snow, realising there it was not a lone attacker.  “My we said she heard Bonya yelp - the wolf must have broken her neck. “In the video you can see the wolf carrying my dog, dead already. “This is the only consolation - she didnapost suffer for too long.” He said: “There were two wolves, one got my dog, and the other one tried to take it. “I found Bonya’s remains. There was no head and paws, just her upper body, and ribs. “Apparently, they didn’t finish eating her. I went home to pick up a box to collect Bonya’s remains to bury her, but when I got back - minutes later, these were gone. “They must have eaten her. Bonya was a mix of Pekingese and a no-breed dog.  “She was so lovely, so cute, everyone loved her. “She was  years old, but she was very active, not old at all.” A lack of prey for wolves meant they were coming into towns, he said. Samarsky said hunters had been sent out to destroy the wolves which posed a threat to the Arctic town.

The Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, in Doha, is made from  old shipping containers. When the World Cup is over, every single piece of the ground will be recycled. It really is an engineering masterpiece. Locals just call it the Container Stadium and it will hold , fans in the Qatari capital. The  World Cup may be mired in controversy due to the choice of hosts but it promises to be like no other tournament before it.  All the venues are close, the furthest distance between any two is barely  miles. In Lusail, seven miles to the north of Doha, we come face-to-face with what must be the world’s biggest building site.A new city as big as Newcastle or Leeds is being created around the stadium which will host the final in front of , fans.The Qataris promise that it will be finished on time. The Mirror visited both venues, with the Qataris set to donate the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium to ious developing countries. Project manager Mohammed Al Atwan said: “It can be dismantled in full and transported to be built again in a dferent country or you could build two ,-seater venues.” After taking theto Lusail, we come across the venue dubbed The Bathtub or Noah’s Ark. The work being carried out around it beggars belief, with the surrounding city set to be home to , residents. As weto Doha we bump into expat Andy Fenton, who tells us: “I was in Brazil for the  World Cup. There, the poor people paid for the tournament through tax rises. “Here, the poor people have seen their lives improve financially. A minimum wage has been brought in and poorer people’s lives have improved. “They still won’t be able to afford tickets for the matches though.” Comment MORE ON World Cup Qatar FA\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Three Lions supporters at the most controversial World Cup ever will need meticulous planning to find affordable accommodation, and booze. The Qataris are expecting . million fans to visit their country, which is barely more than half the size of Wales. Supermarkets don’t sell beer but there will be “fan zones” dotted around the capital Doha where beer will be on sale at £ a pint. The zones will be sealed off by high fences and screens. Qatar is also planning a huge new campsite in the desert and two giant cruise ships to accommodate football fans from around the world.  The Emir of Qatar The country’s ruler loves England. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, , has three wives and  children. He was educated at Sherborne College in Dorset, Harrow in North London and Sandhurst Military Academy, Berkshire. He has urged locals to show “openness and tolerance” to England supporters. One FIFA source said as long as supporters “show respect to local customs” they will be “very welcome”. Law and order If fans are caught being drunk or urinating in public they will be taken to Doha’s notorious Central Jail. Their head will be shaved before they appear before a magistrate. Under Qatar law they could face flogging but it’s more likely they will be deported.  Lestyle It may be a deeply conservative country but scratch the surface and it’s party central. While it’s not as wild as Dubai, there is a frenetic fun scene in the happy hours of posh international hotels. The stadiums and metro system are fantastic. Local restaurants are cheap and there are branches of McDonald’s, KFC and Pizza Hut everywhere. There is very little crime and no ­graffiti or litter to be seen anywhere. Many of the local Qataris and migrant workers speak English. Road and metro signs across the capital are in English. Ubers are plentul and cheap, andyou do rent a car, petrol costs just p a litre.The weather next November and December is likely to be the same as a hot English summer’s day. Alcohol Buying alcohol is a nightmare. Beer and wine are not served in any city-centre restaurants except in high-end hotels. Even in Happy Hour it’s £ a pint. A bottle of house red is £. Most hotels have happy hours for two hours and outside these times you’d need a second mortgage to buy a round. There is one off licence in the whole of Qatar and don’t imagine you can just stroll in there for a few tinnies. The ironically named Qatar Distribution Company is situated in a barren dusty suburb next to the Ideal Indian Primary primary school. As well as booze, it sells pork, which is also banned from supermarkets. There are security staff manning the entrance behind barriers that only let people throughthey have a permit. When we arrived we were immediately asked: “Are you from the embassy ” When we said “No” they refused us entry and called the head of security. He explained that with no permit it was strictly no sale. A worker at our hotel said: “It’s unbelievably strict. EvenEngland fans started planning now and had some sort of address in Qatar, they still wouldn’t get a permit. It will be pricey hotels, the fan zones or the black market for Three Lions fans.”  Those lucky enough to secure a permit are officially invited to apply through their employers. A y application form is filled out and each customer must be sponsored by a company official. The person must be able to prove they earn above a minimum amount. They can only spend a certain percentage of their monthly income on booze. The permit can only be used by the person named and any alcohol bought must be for personal consumption only. The fans World Cup organisers are bracing themselves for a huge increase in visitorsWales and Scotland qualy. Both countries could bring well over , fans eachthey make it through the play-offs next year.  Wales haven’t qualied for the final stages since . Scotland haven’t made it that far since . It means generations of supporters have never seen their team in the final stages of the World Cup. And it could lead to a massive demand for tickets, with the tournament just a seven-hour flight from Cardf or Edinburgh.

highlights of this yearrsquos Baillie Gford Borders Book Festival was the tale of the Carterhaugh Barsquo told by Billie Gillies, Ian Landles and Richard Scott, the Duke of Buccleuch to interviewer Finlay Calder.Most people believe that English Anglican clergyman William Webb Ellis was the original inventor of rugby football while a pupil at Rugby School.According to legend, Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran with it during a school football match around , thus creating the \"rugby\" style of play.Although the story has become firmly entrenched in folklore, it is not supported by substantive evidence and in fact in later years Webb Ellis had no recollection of this incident having taken place.The incident is discounted by most rugby historians as a myth particularly those from the Scottish Borders who cite a well-documented game eight years earlier when  barsquo players came together in a mighty contest on the field of Carterhaugh, near Selkirk on December   for what was advertised as lsquoa Great Foot-Ball Matchrsquo.Two hundred years to the day later two bands of dedicated barsquo players descended on Carterhaugh to celebrate the bicentenary of the match by joining battle in another no-holds-barred contest.Cracked crowns, furious duckings, acts of never-to-be-forgotten heroism and unforgivable betrayal were recalled by Ian Landles who relived the dramas of the original  Carterhaugh Barsquo match, and recalled Walter Scottrsquos pivotal role in organising it.Billy Gillies also explained why the Border barsquo game is absolutely not just a game but a serious business, and gave a blow-by-blow account of the  re-enactment.Billy concluded by revealing that he intends having his ashes sewn into a ball so that he can keep playing the game.Their coffee table

Whether it’s from age, bad weather, or the road was paved poorly to begin with, potholes show up.As with most things in le, they can be fixed the right wayor the wrong way, meaning they quickly open up again.Repairing potholes quickly and correctly is important because it prevents further degradation of the road.It seems easy enough to just fill in the open hole in the road or carpark with new tarmac, but this actually is just a temporary stop-gap. The pothole will almost certainly reappear, and the area between the old tarmac and new tarmac will become the weakest part of the road.Our hardworking and at times thinly-stretched front line road men do a terric job but they like all departments are limited by what funding they receive, as is the wider council.As your local councillor I will continue to build on past success in lobbying for more infrastructure investment and will do my upmost to make sure that no road is left behind.While I can#t guarantee success, I can guarantee that I will be relentless in my pursuit of a better deal for our local ward and the wider Argyll and Bute constituency.As we pause to remember the fallen on Remembrance Day our thoughts naturally turn to the veterans of the Second World War, rightly so.This stoic and humble generation made the ultimate sacrice and have been an inspiration for the countless servicemen and women who have followed after them.We must also remember those who answered their country’s call to serve more recently in campaigns in the Middle East, and Europe.Events in Afghanistan this year reminded us all, not least those who had served there and their families, that for those who do their duty, duty does not end when they arrive home.For many, the physical and mental impact of their service remains with them for the rest of their lives.Our mission at the fund is to find all those who did their duty, however long ago, and ensure they know we are here for them, as long as they need us.In celebration of their service, we are calling on members of the public to share their loved ones’ stories as part of our Month to Remember.

My first passion was for the Just William stories, by Richmal Crompton, all of which I devoured. I also developed a passion for westerns, which amplied my love of cowboy pictures in local cinemas. Luke Short was my favourite author of westerns, though Zane Grey, President Eisenhowers favourite writer, wasnt bad either.What was the first book to make an impact on you The book that had the biggest impact on me as a child was Black Beauty by Anna Sewell. Originally published in , it has been in print ever since. I worked on farms during the holidays as a boy in the Vale of Leven and developed a love of horses, the main agricultural labourers in those pre-tractor days. Black Beauty is, in essence, a horses autobiography, and shows how these noble creatures have been subjected to terrible cruelty by the humans they have served in so many ways for centuries. It instilled in me a hatred of cruelty in all its forms.Which books have made you laugh or cry It was Black Beauty that first made me cry, but it was Oor Wullie in the Sunday Post who made me laugh hardest and longest every weekend. When I discovered Dickens, the weeping continued, but the best laughs always came from that scruffy wee boy sitting on his bucket.Who is your favourite literary character I discovered the novels of Maurice Walsh in my late teens and have ed to them from time to time ever since. Walsh was an Irish writer who wrote romantic novels about what is called the Celtic Twilight, the fading memory of glory and signicance in the old stories of Scotland and Ireland. One of his novels was called Blackcocks Feather, the story of an Aberdonian swordsman who goes to Ireland to help the Celts against the colonising brutality of Elizabeth I in the th century, and finds love as well as moral purpose. I read it again last year, so David Gordon in his fine Highland bonnet, with his long Andrea Ferrara sword on his hip, still has to be one of my favourite literary characters.What is your least favourite genre I dont enjoy fantasy, magic realism or science-fiction, but love a good detective story. Sadly, I cant read westerns any longer.Which book do you wish you had written The Tragic Sense of Le by Miguel De Unamuno, one of the greatest books about the human condition ever written.E-reader of print Print every time, though, for an instant gratier, it is good to be able to whistle up a book at midnight onto my Kindle whenever needed.Which book do you think is overrated Any book that has brought solace or escape or simply helped pass the time has proved its worth to someone.Where do you like to read Wherever I happen to be though I do have a favourite armchair that sees most of the action.What is the last book you read An English Affair: Sex, Class and Power in the Age of Profumo, by Richard Davenport-Hines.What was the last book you didnrsquot finish The Mirror and the Light, the third and final volume of Hilary Mantels novel sequence about Thomas Cromwell. When reading a book, I like to be able to follow and identy the characters without needing a gazetteer beside me to tell me who they are and what theyve been up. I enjoyed the first two books in the series, but this one just confused me.Favourite novelsPride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma ndash and, yes, they are all by Jane Austen.Non-fiction favouritesBoswells Edinburgh Journals: -. The Harold Nicolson Diaries: -. Frances Partridge Diaries: -. Youll have gathered that diaries and journals are my favourite type of non-fiction reading.Favourite Scottish bookIt can only be Scotlands favourite novel, Sunset Song, by Lewis Grassic Gibbon.Whats your guiltypleasure I dont think reading should be associated with guilt, but sometimes Ill indulge myself in a violent American thriller.Which of the pieces anthologised in The Heart of Things means most to you It would be the poem, The Necessity for Irony by the Irish poet Eavan Boland about paying attention to those you love, because one day youll look up and theyll be gone.What would your younger self have made of The Heart of Things He was a romantic wee boy who spent a lot of time walking the hills by himself, so I think he would get the message.Richard Hollowayrsquos latest book, The Heart of Things: An Anthology of Memory and Lament, is published by Canongate, pound."},{"url":null,"title":"walk-port-appin---short-spectacular","story":"Grade: Easy coastal and woodland walkDistance: . miles .kmTime: - hoursVISITORS to the Appin area will be familiar with the iconic view of Castle Stalker, set on its tiny islet in Loch Laich. Dating to the th century, Castle Stalker was taken by the Campbells in , before being recaptured by the Stewarts after a siege in . Restoration work in recent years have made Castle Stalker one of the most familiar and best loved sights in this area of Scotland.The district of Appin is bounded to the west by Loch Linnhe, to the south by Loch Creran, to the east by the districts of Benderloch and Lorne, and to the north by Loch Leven. The name means lsquoabbey landrsquo and there is a lovely short walk around a small peninsula on the western extremity of the area, giving wonderful views across the Lynn of Lorn to Lismore and beyond to the hills of Morvern.The coastline around Appin and Benderloch is incredibly convoluted but we set out on this walk on a beautul summerrsquos day and knew it was a straightforward circuit. Therersquos little danger of getting lost here.Port Appin in summer always gives the impression of being really busy, but the packed car park is iniably full of cars belonging to people who have taken the pedestrian-only ferry across to Lismore. Once you walk beyond the car park and hotel yoursquore likely to have this walk to yourself.Behind the hotel a signpost points the way to Clach Thoull and the obvious track passes through a gate. Even at this early stage the views across to Morvern are inspiring. With steep clfs on one side and a rocky coastline on the other the track meanders along towards a large rock arch. Incredibly this was formed by erosion before the sea level fell. Yoursquoll probably want to walk through it to meet the track on the other side, but before you do that take a wander down through the bracken to the raised beach below. The coastline here is rocky and rugged and the seabound views are dramatic.We wandered back to the arch and continued along the track, which now began to follow the north shore of Airds Bay, a place that is usually alive with waders at times of low tide. To the sound of curlews and sandpipers we strolled through the woods that were alive with the sound of chaffinches.A house signalled the end of the track and a signpost showed the way to Port Appin ndash round the far side of the house where a path ran through the woodland beside a fence. Soon we went through a gate onto the minor road that would take us back to the car park.We stopped at Port Appin village hall to have a look at the display of old lighthouse lanterns. There is a lot of information here about Port Appinrsquos history so itrsquos well worth while a stop.

There, memories of a particularly harsh winter of - are still fresh, when , animals died, temperatures plunged to - degrees, and nomad families who graze their herds of cashmere goats on the countryrsquos fragile grasslands were thrown into jeopardy.Once lush and fertile, the Mongolia steppe is nudging closer to crisis: blisteringly hot in summer, with wild, dramatic winters ndash known as dzud ndash the area is a climate change hot spot with increasingly extreme and severe weather.For shoppers who this weekend will be trawling racks and online shops for cashmere Christmas gts or updating their winter wardrobes, the challenges facing Mongoliarsquos herdsmen and women may be of less consequence than the price tag.Why, after all, pay several hundred pounds for a cashmere sweater from the likes of Johnstons of Elgin, when supermarket cashmere costs little more than dinner for two But while cashmere is cheaper than ever, concerns over its true price are growing.Soaring demand from consumers, a . degree rise in temperatures in Mongolia, plunging prices for raw materials, politics and, in the middle of it all, a traditional way of le under threat, have combined to raise questions over our craving for cashmere luxury.ldquoAs consumers, we need to educate ourselves, says Edinburgh-based Belinda Dickson, founder of the Belinda Robertson cashmere label and now involved with Cashmere Circle, which helps owners extend the le of cashmere products through better care, repairing and, when itrsquos irreparable, recycling into new products.ldquoCashmere is over-farmed just now, which is purely a reaction to demand and the fact wersquove taken cashmere to a lower level in the food chain.ldquoNow itrsquos quantity over quality. We have devalued cashmere, so it is no longer the aspirational product it used to be. What was once a handcrafted product now almost feels like battery farming.There are many conscientious cashmere brands working hard to raise awareness and who strive to ensure an ethical approach, she adds.But the figures surrounding cashmere are concerning it forms nearly % of the  billion global luxury industry, with % of it originating in Mongolia and China.To meet demand, the number of goats have soared. In Mongolia, where there were five million in , there are now more than  million, leading to overgrazing and degradation of grasslands already under stress due to climate change.As well as the damage to their ability to capture carbon, are fears for wildle and bioersity.Last week a new study published in the journal Conservation Biology warned that the rising numbers of goats in Mongolia have taken over land where snow leopards hunt, affecting their prey and endangering the future of the , that remain in the wild.There are also concerns that mass production raises the potential for fraud, and the pressures on small families of herders faced with caring for large numbers of goats, leading to animal husbandry and social concerns.All of which raises issues for consumers whose love of fast, disposable fashion is fuelling demand, and Scotlandrsquos own cashmere specialists and producers.Una Jones, founder and SEO of the Sustainable Fibre Alliance, set up to help address the issues surrounding cashmere, grew up in Mongolia and has witnessed the impact of soaring demand.ldquoThere are global supply and demand issues, ever-increasing pressure on herders to produce, and the only way for them to survive is bring the number of goats up, she says.ldquoThat effects grassland vegetation % of land is degraded, yet this trend continues to grow.The issues are more complex than just cutting goat numbers, she warns.ldquoItrsquos immoral to tell people you have to bring your number of goats down because the land is degraded. This is their livelihood. And we canrsquot tell a commercial company that they should downgrade their profit.ldquoWe need to add value for herders so they can either increase the quality or work with others to bring collective resilience in dficult winters.ldquoWe need to encourage good quality cashmere.Launched in , SFA recently met the Mongolian delegation during COP, touring cashmere mill Alex Begg in Ayr. Talks focused on climate and land restoration, and of how to create an economy in sustainable cashmere.One SFA initiative is its Cashmere Standard quality mark which indicates brandsrsquo commitment to sustainability and ethical production.The first SFA labels arrived on products last year, while cashmere brands, producers and retailers have pledged support: earlier this year John Lewis announced it would fund a three-year SFA programme to expand the organisationrsquos standards from Mongolia to the Inner Mongolia region.And Johnstons of Elgin has collaborated on the first SFA course in Sustainable Pasture Management, teaching traditional herding practices to children of nomadic herders which so far has involved more than  young people.The SFA hope is to encourage production of better quality fibre from fewer goats, while building resilience for the challenges of climate change, says its Operations Manager, Zara Morris-Trainor.ldquoMongolia is a country of climatic extremes, very hot in summer and very cold in winter. Storms were once every ten years but are now every couple of years. There is also severe drought, rainfall has reduced - so there is real time severe impact of climate change.ldquoSevere winters are becoming more frequent, therersquos not enough vegetation to sustain the livestock, numbers collapse and then shoot back up.ldquoWe need to reduce the number of goats, but herders are reliant on cashmere for % of their income.Rebooting an entire sector may mean higher prices and the demise of the cheap cashmere sweater.ldquoItrsquos hard for consumers, she adds, ldquothere are not many options out there in terms of purchasing sustainable cashmere that they can feel confident about.ldquoThere has been a massive increase in awareness about sustainability, but there is a lot of greenwashing in the industry.ldquoWe want a long-term solution on a global scale.Closer to home, efforts are being made to address cashmerersquos sustainability issues and reverse its growing image as a lsquofast fashionrsquo garment to be worn and thrown away.Lotti Blades-Barrett recently launched Second Cashmere, which sources cashmere from textile recyclers, saving garments from being shredded, and carefully restoring them.Those that canrsquot be repaired are carefully unpicked to be made into new items. Shrunken cashmere, where the fibre has taken a felt-like appearance, becomes luxury hot water bottle covers.ldquoThere has been a real drop in communication with respect to the amount of resources, time and skill that goes into producing cashmere, and a disconnect with the consumer, she says.ldquoItrsquos been mind-blowing to see what ends up at textile recyclers, she says. ldquoThere are beautul quality items that look like theyrsquove been worn a handful of times.

Both councils claims include interest over a ten year period from .UK haulage firms are also suing the truck manufacturers accused of operating a cartel to fix truck prices and are watching the Scottish case carefully.A number of companies that bought or leased trucks between  and  are seeking a payout said to be worth up to poundbn through legal action led by the Road Haulage Association , which is pursuing a claim on their behalf at the Competition Appeal Tribunal though a collective proceedings order .The RHA lodged a claim three years ago seeking more than pound, in compensation on each truck purchased between  and , against truck makers DAF, Daimler, Iveco, Volvo, Renault, Scania and MAN.Details of the Scottish claims came as the councils began fighting truck firms assertions that their actions were void because they are protected by a five year time limitation on court proceedings.The Scottish action is similar to the RHA action and also includes Fiat Chrysler and Paccar.Glasgow City Council claims that during the period of the cartel between  and  it purchased medium and heavy trucks by the manufacturers for sums amounting to around pound million.The sum sued for is calculated on the basis that the typical overcharge caused by the operation of the cartel was %.Some of the  including West Dunbartonshire Council, have claims in respect of purchases of other vehicles, such as buses.Manufacturers have been fined euro.bnby the European Commissionin total ndash a record penalty imposed by the commission for a vehicle cartel.In July , the European Commissionfound that five of Europersquos largest truck manufacturers ndash MAN, DAF, Iveco, Volvo Renault and Daimler ndash had taken part in a cartel between  and  with the aim of fixing prices for large and medium trucks.MAN, owned by VW, alerted the commission to the cartel and escaped a euro.bn fine.The other four received a % reduction in fines for settling.The biggest penalty, of eurobn , was imposed on Germanyrsquos Daimler. Dutch company DAF was fined eurom , Volvo Renault euromand Italyrsquos Iveco eurom .A subsequent decision, in September , concluded that Scania was also involved, and the Swedish manufacturer was fined eurom .Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said in September,  when Scania were fined: ldquoThe decision marks the end of our investigation into a very long-lasting cartel ndash  years.ldquoThis cartel affected very substantial numbers of road hauliers in Europe, since Scania and the other truck manufacturers in the cartel produce more than nine out of every  medium and heavy trucks sold in Europe. Instead of colluding on pricing, the truck manufacturers should have been competing against each other ndash also on environmental improvements.The -year collusion began at a meeting at a hotel in Brussels in January , according to the commission, and came to an end in  when it carried out surprise inspections of the firms.Senior managers colluded at meetings on the fringes of trade fairs and other events, and also discussed price fixing by phone. From , the cartel was run by lower- level managers through the companiesrsquo German subsidiaries and information was exchanged by email.The truck makers coordinated ldquogross list prices and also colluded on passing on to customers the costs of new technologies to meet stricter emission rules.The commission said its investigation did not reveal any links between this cartel and the use of defeat devices to cheat emissions tests.Law firms, including Fieldfisher, are handling claims after their clients Glasgow City Council and West Dunbartonshire Council, which had bought trucks, were told by the Court of Session that they were able to proceed with their claim.ldquoIn claims such as these, the liability is already determined, so the claimant only needs to show causation and loss, Fieldfisher said. ldquoThe truck manufacturers have been trying to block further claims by arguing they will be time-barred. However, the Scottish Court of Session rejected a prescription strike-out brought by the defendants.ldquoAlthough a decision of the Scottish courts is not binding in England, it will be persuasive.\"While Scottish and English limitation rules rely on separate legislation, the ruling meant claims could be made in Scotland up until July  and for England up until July .But the truck firms are now contesting that decision saying that the councils should have made their claim earlier, given that news of the ECrsquos investigation into the truck cartel first broke in .In an appeal launched last week, they say that claims should have been made within five years of having sufficient awareness that they were being misled.In Scotland the time limit for bringing a claim for damages for breach of contract or negligence is five years from the date the wronged party first became or could have become aware of issues. The legal rules on time bar are found in the Prescription  LimitationAct .Roddy Dunlop QC for Daimler said that by March, , there was in the public domain information not only that the Office For Fair Trading were investigating price fixing, but that the EU stated they had \"reason to believe that is what happened\".He said: \"What you dont do is sit back and say time doesnt start till there is a European Commission decision.\"The OFT closed a criminal investigation of suspected cartel activity in December,  due to \"insufficient evidence\" but said it was continuing a price-fixing probe.The OFT closed its civil investigation into suspected cartel behaviour in June,  \"on the grounds of administrative priority\" after a \"detailed review of the available evidence and discussions with the European Commission\"It said the European Commission was \"particularly well placed\" to take the investigation forward\" and said it had not reached a view over whether there had been a breach of competition law.Gerry Moynihan QC for the councils argued that the clock would not start ticking on taking action until July , when the the European Commissionmade its judgement on the cartel.\"This is not a case of local authorities choosing to sit back,\" said Mr Moyniham who pointed out that there was nothing the councils could have done to investigate the cartel earlier adding that there was \"deliberate concealment\".The Road Haulage Association produced a video in  explaining how UK truck owners can join agroup legal action and that there is no cost for joiningJustice Tye last year argued that while the first fines were not announced until , \"I am in no doubt thata Scottish local authority had attempted to inquire into the existence of a cartel whose activities had affected the prices paid for commercial vehicles of an unspecied nature during an unspecied period of time, it would have been met by a refusal by the companies concerned to provide any information, in order to avoid jeopardising their applications for immunity and leniency\".He added: ldquoIt is not surprising that, as is common ground, no-one in the United Kingdom raised any proceedings against any of the addressees before the details of the [EC competition commission] decision were announced, he ruled.Court papers show that Grant Montgomery, category manager for transport and environment with Scotland Excel, a centre of procurement expertise for Scottish local authorities, first became aware that local authorities in Scotland might have claims against the truck manufacturers in July, , when he readinga report about the fines imposed by the Commission \"which appeared to come out of the blue\".He drew the matter to the attention of his line managers and consulted with Renfrewshire Councils legal team.He went on to send an email headed ldquofor information only ndash no action required at this time to contacts in all Scottish local authorities, drawing the commission decision to their attention and suggesting that they discuss it with their legal departments."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amADVERTORIAL: Mout Cancer Action Month November  www.mouthcancer.orgcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues.

As well as food sharing, Community Fridges give people opportunities to contribute through volunteering, learning new skills and sharing their existing skills.#Jane Nelson, chair of Greener Orkney, said: #Although the project will start small, we intend it to grow and estimate we will eventually need twenty volunteers to open and close the fridge each day, collect food from suppliers, and ensure the area is clean and tidy. We are reaching out to local charities and organisations to see how we can combine efforts to quickly expand this project.#Possible premises have been identied but first must be approved by Environmental Health to operate as a community fridge. Opening hours will depend on the number of volunteers and what donations are received. There will be a dedicated Facebook page and volunteers will update it daily to advise what food is available.If any organisations or iniduals are interested in helping with, or finding out more about the project, please reach out to Greener Orkney: greenerorkney@gmailcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The current bus service impacts are:  Junction Road will be closed between Castle Streetand Tankerness Lane . Public Bus services affected are X,,,,,S and . Buses will turn left out of Travel Centre, left at Kiln Corner Roundabout, left at the Ayre Roundabout onto Great Western Road, rejoining routes on Pickaquoy Road .Works are planned for Outertown Road, Stromness, starting on Monday, November  to Thursday, December .Meanwhile, folk can expect roadworks on the A junction with Gorseness Road , on Friday, December  and Saturday .Roadworkers will be heading to the B road on Shapinsay between Housebay Cottage and Howe Farm, from Tuesday, December  to Thursday .On Monday and Tuesday - December, roadworks are planned for Old Finstown Road between Zions Loan and Kingsdale.The A St Mary’s, corner at The Inn, will be subject to roadworks from Monday, December  to Friday . The work is programmed to last for up to five days and will be carried out under road closure conditions in order for the folks involved to be as safe as possible. To reduce the impact of this, the closures will be restricted to am to .pm which should enable school transport to operate with a minimum of disturbance.Outwith the road closure times traffic will be restricted to using one side of the road and will be controlled by temporary traffic lights which will result in delays during busier periods.A ersion route will be in place via the Aand the B from St Andrews Primary School to the First Churchill Barrier.Stagecoach has advised that during the hours of am – :pm, the X commercial service from St Margarets Hope to Kirkwall will ert via the Kirkwall to Deerness road past St Andrews Primary School to the First Barrier and on to St Margaret’s Hope as per the existing timetable. Due to the change of route and possible disruptions, OIC asks passengers to allow   minutes on current scheduled times as there are likely to be delays.During the period of closure, there will be an additional X service in operation from Kirkwallas per the current timetable which will serve as far as St Marys and back for passengers residing in the Holm area. Therefore, the pick up  drop off point for passengers will be from Park of Ayre and therefore there will be no service between the First Barrier and Park of Ayre during the period of closure.Posters notying passengers of the ersions will be placed on the X service, Kirkwall Travel Centre and affected bus shelters. It should be noted that passengers can track buses across Orkney on the Stagecoach App which would provide accurate timings.OIC apologises for the inconvenience this will cause during the period of road closure. For further information on the X timetable during this time please contact Stagecoach on   or visitwww.orkney.gov.uk transport for timetable information.As for the council#s flagstone repairs, the works on John Street have been completed, with all barriers and signs now removed and the section reopened, today, Friday, November .In Victoria Street, from Bank Lane towards its junction with Ferry Road at the fountain works have been completed and reinstatements are curing with barriers expected to be removed next week. Access by the works area will been maintained.At Ferry Road, adjacent to the fountain, works have started and will continue next week, when the appropriate signs and barriers are erected. Access will be maintained.From Monday, November , works will commence on the section of Victoria Street from The Pier Bistro to the bottom of Church Road, with the section being closed to all vehicles. This section will be closed until the end of November.The works will then move onto Alfred Street, from December , starting at Hellihole Road junction, with the section up to the Lighthouse Pier access closed.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

We look forward to the future discussions on behalf of Shinty within the city affording Scotland’s first sport a facility befitting the cultural importance of our traditional sport.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?1637251037000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211118newscovid 19 thu 18th november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallCoronavirus Northern Ireland: six further deaths and nearly , new cases recorded PremiumSwann facing legal action over lack of mandatory testing for care home staffSwann launches fresh push on vaccines as health service struggles with enormous demandLong delays blamed for over , patients leaving AE before treatment finishedMost ReadBullying, favouritism, ageism… the accusations that keep haunting BBC NI‘Disturbing and distressing’: Broadcaster Mark Sidebottom tells of scenes during visit to hospital AETaxi sex act couple not needed for driver’s trialCouncillors clash after Co Down Christmas tree relocated in neighbouring village - km awaySam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallPlayRed Bull Car Park Drt is taking place at the Titanic slipwayLatest CoronavirusSam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsSwann facing legal action over lack of mandatory testing for care home staffMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageApproval of mandatory Covid passports responsible for ‘small surge’ in young people getting vaccinatedCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautionsLatest‘Jabs coverage and earlier Delta spread could see UK escape Europe surge’‘Systemic racial bias’ likely in health services around the world – JavidAaron McCarey sends ‘mistake’ message to Glentoran fans after celebrating Crusaders win with Bobby Burns a month on from infamous clashMan charged with murder of pensioner found dead in homePandemic has made it more dficult to tackle migrant crisis – Javid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Robinson.Bertie Ahern. FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA paramilitary mural on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast.Allan PrestonTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailResidents in east Belfast have largely defended their home after former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern named the area in the same sentence as “ghettos” – while also saying people were incapable of understanding the Northern Ireland protocol.Mr Ahern drew criticism from unionists on Thursday after speaking at an event hosted by the Brexit Institute at Dublin City University.“I spend a lot of my le still in the North. The reality is in East Belfast and in the ghettos and in the areas where you’re likely to get trouble, is that people haven’t got a clue about the protocol, not a clue. They see it as identity,” he said.Mr Ahern said that loyalists were only able to view the protocol as a “trick by the south” to force them into a united Ireland.In a later interview with RTE radio, Mr Ahern denied his comments were anti-loyalist, adding: “There are many areas in my own constituency in the past where they were described as ghettos or rough areas.“Thankfully we moved away from that, so I don’t think people should get themselves in a knot.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBertie Ahern told to apologise for loyalist #ghetto# remarkOn east Belfast’s Newtownards road on Friday, many residents said they were offended by the remarks, while one former shipyard worker wholeheartedly agreed.Waiting on the shutters of her hairdresser to open, one longtime resident, who referred to herself as Mrs B, said: It sounds ridiculous. At one time, east Belfast did look like a ghetto because there was a lot of shops and things closing.But it’s got on its feet again, so calling it a ghetto now is a bit too much. There are some streets I hardly recognise because there’s that many new buildings and houses.A lot of these streets were just little one room places with a toilet that’s out the back. But today it#s new houses everywhere you look.”On Mr Ahern’s comments about the protocol, she said: “I very rarely listen to politics. Sometimes I think politicians will just say what you want to hear.”Discussing the recent bus burnings carried out by loyalist paramilitaries as a protest against the protocol, she said: “It’s sad to think we’re going backwards as whenever I grew up, you were dodging bullets.”James Nelsonworked in the Belfast shipyards for over  years and said Mr Ahern was right to call his home a ghetto.I was born and reared down here, they haven’t improved anything,” he said.They’ve actually made it a worse ghetto and tore the heart right out of east Belfast and lower Newtownards Road.There’s hardly any shops and there’s just one pub on this whole road when there used to be around .They’ve boxed everything in and they’ve put no infrastructure in at all.”He added: “I think Bertie’s got it right, there#s nothing down here for anyone. Especially with the drug problem in east Belfast right down to Bangor.It doesn’t seem to be getting addressed whatsoever, even though the dogs in the street know who’s at it.”He said Mr Ahern was probably right that most loyalists didn#t understand the protocol.I don’t believe we think it’s a trick though. Although some people are blind after listening to the DUP as usual.Personally, I think the DUP signed up for it and backed Boris, then Boris back-doored them and said ‘see yous later’ as the Conservatives always do.”Nearby, waiting for a metro bus into town was Mr A. Robinson . He said he took exception to having east Belfast dismissed by Mr Ahern.“Personally speaking, the ordinary common man in the whole of Ireland doesn’t really understand the protocol,” he said.I don’t understand it and I think half the people in Stormont don’t understand the protocol. We’re relying on our politicians here to work the protocol out.But Mr Ahern is an intelligent man, he shouldn’t have said things like that because that’s wrong.I’d say % of people down south don’t understand the protocol either.”Mr Robinson also rejected the idea that east Belfast was a ghetto.There is a couple of ghettos in east Belfast but that’s not true for the majority of the area,” he said.You have rough areas anywhere  like in the Shankill but it’s not fair to say we’re in a ghetto.I think sometimes politicians like Mr Ahern speak without using their brains, he may regret it later on.”A short distance up the road, another resident, Robert Jenkins , was out walking his two dogs.“I’m not happy to hear east Belfast called a ghetto, I don’t think Bertie Ahern’s been in east Belfast enough to pass comment,” he said.I’ve lived in east Belfast all my le and I’m proud of it. Like in every part of the province, there’s rough parts but there’s also areas where the houses cost nearly a million pounds, it’s hardly a ghetto.”He said he did believe the protocol had the effect of chipping away at the identity of the community.This is just the straw that broke the camel’s back really. We’re not allowed to march where we want and things like that, so people feel they’re being picked on in east Belfast.”Another lelong resident, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I don’t know about anyone  in east Belfast but I definitely don’t consider it to be a ghetto.There are honest, hardworking people and to say that it’s a ghetto is disgusting.”One resident of the Bloomfield area was out with her friend, Stephanie Pepaj , from New York, who has recently started working in east Belfast.Stephanie said: “I don#t see it as a ghetto really. This building here is beautul but I do think there are parts that maybe need more regeneration.But I definitely think it is an up and coming area.”Her friend, from Belfast, added: “I think over the past few years, everything has been developing around here.Even in the past year or two, lots of businesses. House prices out here are more affordable than other parts of the city which is a big attraction too.”On Mr Ahern’s comments about the protocol, she said: “Some people are interested in researching what’s going on and others just go along with the crowd.I think a lot of people probably do think it’s a trick to get a united Ireland and that no one really cares about Northern Ireland at all.”Stephanie added: “It’s alarming when I see the news and hear about burning buses. There’s other violence and crime back home but it’s dferent.It’s confusing because I feel like I can’t really say anything because I would need to know the history and live here for years and years.”Speaking from behind the counter of his butchers shop on the Newtownards Road, David McMullan called Mr Ahern’s ghetto comments “very rude”.People in this area, working class people are lovely. It’s a thriving community where everyone sticks together,” he said.A woman has just been in the shop and she gave me £ to donate to the food bank down the street.She used her High Street Voucher to do that, and another woman did the same thing last Saturday.”On the Northern Ireland protocol, he said: “It is very hard to understand. You have to be really tuned in to understand it.”Sourcing his meat locally, however, he said Brexit concerns had not affected his business.Things like that don’t bother me. I would just tell Bertie Ahern to be more respectful.”Most ReadBullying, favouritism, ageism… the accusations that keep haunting BBC NI‘Disturbing and distressing’: Broadcaster Mark Sidebottom tells of scenes during visit to hospital AETaxi sex act couple not needed for driver’s trialCouncillors clash after Co Down Christmas tree relocated in neighbouring village - km awaySam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallPlayRed Bull Car Park Drt is taking place at the Titanic slipwayLatest Northern IrelandVaccine certication will help deliver safer Christmas, says SDLP MLADepartures rising at the BBC:  gone since January Mick McDermott: Glentoran’s investment is a fraction of European money the likes of Crusaders have earned… we’re hanging on to their coat-tails‘Jordan Stewart promised me he’d score’: David Healy toasts Linfield’s match-winner in vital victory over CltonvilleIrish League transfers: Linfield prepare new Robbie McDaid raid as Glentoran agree deal for former Blues aceLatestWayne Pivac excited for the future as Wales emerge from the autumn with optimismRacism not taken seriously enough by sporting bodies, says JavidJoe Marler says England’s future looks bright after autumn clean sweepEurope’s anti-lockdown protests: From violence in Vienna to riots in RotterdamEU insists it must have overview on goods which could enter single market,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI. There were % of Sinn Fein voters who said they either had no opinion or remain undecided.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyUlster Unionist PartyArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillGerry KellyMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandTeen ‘threw fireworks at cops’ homes for a laugh’ on Remembrance SundayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City Hall PremiumConcern as  serving PSNI officers not fully vetted PremiumMisogyny should be a hate crime, says senior PSNI officer Mark HamiltonFormer PSNI chief Stephen Martin ‘regrets’ not meeting employee who raised sexual misconduct allegationsMost ReadBullying, favouritism, ageism… the accusations that keep haunting BBC NI‘Disturbing and distressing’: Broadcaster Mark Sidebottom tells of scenes during visit to hospital AETaxi sex act couple not needed for driver’s trialCouncillors clash after Co Down Christmas tree relocated in neighbouring village - km awaySam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsTop VideosPlayTake a look inside this unique Bangor propertyPlayAnti-vaccine passport protest takes place at Belfast City HallPlayRed Bull Car Park Drt is taking place at the Titanic slipwayLatest PoliticsJon TongeOpinionNo consensus on the past, but  holds out hope for futurePM silent on grope claims against his dad StanleyYou can push yourself: Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds living with multiple sclerosis to run for StormontViewpointOpinionPoliticians do not deserve this abuseActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongLatest‘Jabs coverage and earlier Delta spread could see UK escape Europe surge’‘Systemic racial bias’ likely in health services around the world – JavidAaron McCarey sends ‘mistake’ message to Glentoran fans after celebrating Crusaders win with Bobby Burns a month on from infamous clashMan charged with murder of pensioner found dead in homePandemic has made it more dficult to tackle migrant crisis – Javid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

David said: “Each winning photographer received their own copy of the calendar and an organic cotton Trek NI beanie hat.“I know the judges found it really tough choosing just  images from those sent in, such was the overall quality of the submissions.  per cent of every sale goes to PIPS charity, a non-profit organisation which provides crisis support for those at risk of suicide or self-harm. David continued: “ was obviously an incredibly dficult year for everyone due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions imposed on everyday le because of it. “Mental health, which was already a major issue for many around the world, was exacerbated further by isolation and loneliness. “PIPS do fantastic work with those suffering from poor mental health, especiallytheyve considered suicide, so we wanted to help support their efforts this time round.” Trek NI is an online resource and eco-friendly brand inspired by Northern Ireland that connects local businesses with a highly-engaged local audience, championing everything Northern Ireland has to offer.

Destined is a voluntary charitable organisation that seeks to address the needs of people with learning disabilities in a whole le context. Inclusively Fitprovides one to one personal training and health and fitness classes to children and young adults with Learning Disabilities. Founders of Inclusively Fit, Sineacutead Lynch and Bronagh McNamara, work with Destined often and said thisisa great achievement for all the members. Sineacutead said:For the last six to eight weeks, weve been training them to run the K. We just thought, lets try and get them to train for something, and we thought a k was just the right distance. “So, we’re now doing a ‘Couch to k, and we wanted to make it into an actual event, and kind of official, because we just feel like theyve never participated in anything like this before. “Theyve worked so hard and next Thursday, were going to do our official k, asyou were training for a marathonweve got a start line and we’ve got medals. “Danny Quigley is going to come and surprise them and run it with them and cheer them on. We just want to make it as big an event for them as possible because its such a big achievement. “We wanted to do something for them, so they get to do an event. We train people with learning disabilities, thats what we do. We wanted to try and give that opportunity to adults with learning disabilities to push themselves and have goals. “This is their first ever run to show their training and show what they’ve achieved. There’s never really anything like this organised and we wanted to do it for them.” There will be around  to  participants andSineacutead and Bronagh are hoping to encourage families, friends and the Derry public to pop down on Thursday and cheer all the runners on. Sineacutead added: “They’ve trained so hard, especially at this time of the year, in the wind and the rain, they have shownup and they’ve done it no matter what. “Some of them wouldnt even have attempted to go outside before and theyve just come so far. Im so delighted for them andeverythingthey’ve achieved.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity.

She was admitted to hospital with stroke-like symptoms. However, In December, Nicoles condition deteriorated signicantly and she lost her eyesight Speaking to the Donegal Live, Geraldine McDermott said she and her family were “overwhelmed” with the fundraising effort currently taking place in Inishowen and wider Donegal to support Nicoles future treatment. FND is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the ing of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and   or receives signals. Symptoms can include motor dys, seizures, vision and speech dficulties, and paralysis. Geraldine said: “Nicole will be under the care of Neurologist, Professor Mark Edwards. Professor Edwards specialises in FND. He will prepare a rehabilitation plan for Nicole. She will be an in-patient in the Brain and Mind Hospital in London for anything from six weeks onwards, depending on how much time she needs. “FND is essentially a signal, a message from the brain which is not getting to the body. Professor Edwards is hopeful they can turn the signals on again and restore Nicoles eyesight. “There has been a massive, massive fundraising effort for Nicole. It started off with Veronica Dowds Long completing a k, which finished up in the Wooden Brew Coffee Shop in Burnfoot, where they had a coffee morning. There was another coffee morning in OFlahertys Pub in Buncrana and there was a golf tournament at the North West Golf Club at Lisfannon. Well known Gael, Burnfoots Andrew Wallace organised a Run for Nicole k on November  Sister Act held an event in OFlahertys, Burt GAA held a fundraiser and Burnfoot Service Station sold lines and raised €,. We cannot thank everyone enough. “On Sundaythere will be a stellar line-up at our major fundraising concert in An Grianaacuten Hotel in Burt. The artists performing include, John McNicholl, Dominic Kirwan and Sandy Kelly, along with local musician, Keelan Arbuckle, and young Killian Joe.” The David Craig Band, which played at Nicole and Ciarans wedding two years ago, is also playing at the An Grianaacuten concert. Tickets for the event are available from the hotel and Creative Landscaping Works in Letterkenny and from Geraldine who can be contacted on: . According to Geraldine, up until December , Nicoles quality of le was fine. She added: “Nicole was having daily seizures and was in chronic pain but she could manage. If she had a seizure, we dealt with it. Maybe a stranger looking on would have thought it was terrible but, it was part of our lives, part of Nicole. “But, in December, she lost her eyesight and then she lost her speech. She now has limited speech and is in bed all the time. She has no social interaction at all now. “We met Professor Edwards on October . because she will not be well enough, initially, to travel to London, she will begin her treatment here. We have raised €, for Nicoles treatment to date and are going to continue fundraising. “We would definitely like to thank everybody from the bottom of our hearts. We are overwhelmed. Nicoles consultant is hopeful her eyesight can be restored, as well as her speech and some of her mobility. There is definitely hope. “I would like to thank everybody. The support for Nicole has been as been overwhelming. We have had businesses and people coming forward with donations without even being asked. The An Grianaacuten concert will be a fantastic. We have loads of prizes, including € vouchers and hampers. Inishowen, Donegal and Derry are rallying around for Nicole.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Brian Murray on the sideline as the final whistle is awaited in SportDonegal All-Ireland winner hands in his badge after  years as a Garda overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Covid- cases in Donegal over the past two weeks Local NewsHas Donegal finally managed to get on top of Covid- rate of spread  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Wool is sustainable and wool is renewableLocal NewsDonegal yarns to play important role in major new review of wool markets overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsMan jailed for brutal and savage baseball attack causing le-long injuries appeals conviction overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   Atlantic Way, BundoranLocal NewsTwo Donegal apartments set to go under the hammer overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId Local NewsDeaths in Donegal - Saturday evening, November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeJason Quigley stopped in round two as Demetrius Andrade delivers statement win overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId Local NewsDeaths in Donegal - Saturday morning, November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Deaths in Donegal- Sunday morning - November Local NewsDeaths in Donegal - Sunday morning - November  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lack of parking enforcement raises concerns from Buncrana tradersLocal NewsThere will be no retail left in five or ten years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia GAAPhoto Gallery of GAA supporters at Junior A  B Finals in ODonnell Park, Letterkenny overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The court heard how police had been called to Secrets night club, Magherafelt, at around .pm on the night of December  , where the security manager told them he had ejected a female. The manager told police she had bottled another female over the head while inside, knocking her unconscious in the process. The injured party had then been taken to AE, where she was forced to remain overnight and had surgical glue applied to a wound. When being arrested, the defendant became irate and police reports from the night in question revealed she shouted “F**k you, f**k your ma and f**k your da” at police and members of the public. She also yelled repeatedly that she did not hit anybody. Later, on viewing CCTV footage of the incident, a guilty plea was entered by the defendant. Judge Mullan noted that the contents of a pre-sentence report completed on McKenna did not endear her to the court. While discussing the injuries to the other female, the report noted the defendant as saying: “She got hair extensions a few days later.” Defence for McKenna said the incident had arisen due to a school-type hostility between the women. Although noting the defendant had no previous record, they conceded that due to the amount of alcohol taken, the defendant had made her debut in a most spectacular way. Counsel also noted that at the time of the offence, McKenna had been just  years old, and had been initially charged in a youth court but turned  in the meantime. They said the incident should be viewed in the context that the defendant was a youth who was intoxicated on licensed premises and that the behaviour was consistent with that context. McKenna had indicated she was unable to complete community service or probation, and Judge Mullan told the court this had limited the options available to her. She sentenced the defendant to four months imprisonment, suspended for a period of  months, and issued a three-year restraining order prohibiting her from contacting the injured party.

Judge Mullan began by telling the court the defendants pre-sentence report had made for unbelievable reading, and that she had no regard for road traffic laws. She said Johnston had already received suspended sentences, probation and disqualication, but that she continued to get into a car in the knowledge that she could well go to prison. Addressing the defendant, the judge asked why this was the case. “A lot of it has to do with my head, but Ive been working with the mental health team to get it in order,” she replied. Judge Mullan told the defendant the court had been patient with her, and noted she had even gone out, bought a vehicle while disqualied and then subsequently drove the vehicle.

This will mean an extra pound. per week to your energy which will amount to paying out pound a year more than Power NI users did  months ago. Power NI has blamed the rise on the increase in global wholesale gas prices but MS Ferguson says that will cut little ice with Derry households already struggling to make ends meet. She said: “News that hard-pressed families are set to be hit with another price hike will come as another huge blow. “As with all such price hikes, those hardest hit by this will be low-paid workers and middle income families. Many of these families are already struggling to make ends meet. “We are in the middle of a cost of living crisis as energy prices soar largely due to global demand issues at the same time as inflation is rising and food and other costs are increasing. “Sinn Feacutein is calling on the British government to remove VAT on energy bills during this global price spike to help support families. “It should also explore a windfall tax on energy generators similar to that introduced in other European states and redirect the money raised towards tackling fuel poverty.” In response, William Steele, director of Power NI customer solutions, said: “We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible, but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months. “ Like other suppliers, we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tarfs. “As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay. For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

Pic by Seb Daly SportsfileReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk tonight, but he is still hoping to write more chapters in what has so far been a career of glittering success. googletag.cmd.push Ironically, McEleney will bid his farewells to Oriel Park at the end of the game against his new club and hometown team in Derry City. While the Dundalk fans will be saying goodbye, the travelling City fans will be welcoming home a prodigal son in the same breath. McEleney signed with the Lilywhites in December , as he went on the search for trophies – and in that, he has succeeded. Three league titles,  FAI Cups and  League Cups have all been won in Dundalk colours, and he has been part of two squads who have made it to the Europa League group stages. For all those achievements, he has a thousand more memories scoring against BATE Borislov in the Champions League qualying round, scoring a penalty against Sherf Tiraspol to help Dundalk qualy for the - Europa League group stages, and playing against Arsenal at the Emirates. Any footballer would be proud to look back on all that, but not Patrick. For him the past is the past, and he wants to achieve so much more now that he is ing to Derry City. If anything, he is even hungrier than he was when he left the Brandywell six years ago. “It came full circle,” he agrees. “I’m properly excited to kick on with Derry City and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve been watching them a lot, especially since I’ve signed and I’ve been trying to pick up things. There are some really good players there which I knew from playing against them anyway. I’m really looking forward to next year and getting my family back home.” “Whenever he contacted me in  he said he really wanted me and he explained how I was going to fit in and how I was going to play. I went down that first year and won the league and got to the Europa League Group Stages and that was surreal to be honest. “Being in that environment I knew there was only one way it was going and we were going to be successful for a lot of years. I was just thankful to Stephen for the opportunity, but I had no doubts in my own ability and what I was going to be able to do for the team. It was amazing times, but it’s gone now, and it’s in the past and it’s time to make new memories.” McEleney did enjoy some success with Derry City after arriving back from Sunderland back in . A part of the squad which win the First Division that year, McEleney went on to win a League Cup in  and the FAI Cup in . Since then, Derry City have won just one trophy – the  League Cup, while McEleney has gathered enough silverware to make any other footballer jealous. With the tide changing at the Brandywell in recent months following theof Ruaidhri Higgins, McEleney is hoping all those statistics can improve. He would oven thing ore than to win wearing the red and white of his home town club. “Whenever I was leaving Derry at the time, I was leaving home,” he said. “It was no secret about how much I loved the club – I still do, I’m a fan and I still go to Derry matches whenever I can – Even playing against them for Dundalk, I’m not going to lie, it was dficult and it was the same the whole time. “I knew at the time I had to make the move, and I’m clever in that sense to know what I need to do, My timing has been pretty good so far, maybe apart from my Oldham move, but you live and you learn. To come down here and play in two Europa League group stages and won what I’ve won, was definitely the right thing to do, and I’m sure % of people would agree with it.” Unexpected McEleney’s final year at Dundalk did not go how anyone expected, with the Lilywhites at one stage looking over their shoulders at relegation, such has been their fall from grace. A new takeover has restored some optimism to the club, but so much damage has been done, proving that in football, success is never guaranteed. “I could sit here all day and explain a million dferent things of what I believed happened, but it is what it is,” McEleney states. “You have to dig deep sometimes and people get things wrong. The players need to look at themselves too. We’re the ones playing and you have to take some responsibility and accountability somewhere. I do anyway. To go from the Europa League group stages to the way it was this year was not good enough and it was a big shock, but we got through it and that was the main thing.” McEleney’s decision to join Derry City was announced in July, and that did not go down well in some quarters, but there was no doubting the player’s focus, and he starred for Dundalk in the weeks that followed, the stand-out performance coming in the two-goal display against Vitesse Arnheim in August. “It was a strange situation but I had to do it for a number of reasons,” he admits. “I think a lot of people were going to question of I was going to down tools. From the outside looking in, it might look asI’m an easy-going guy, and even in the way I play because I can float about, but the people that really know me, know that’s not me. I’m definitely a winner, and I was never going to let anybody question me as a person or question what I was going to do for Dundalk, so it was up to me to put in performances on the pitch in that period of time to make sure no-one would question me. I believe I did that and more.” Goodbye McEleney was given a nice send-off by some fans at training this week, and he is sure to be given a huge ovation tonight. It is the end of an era for both he and his family. “It’s sad,” he admits. “Obviously during the time of it, it can get frustrating and getting the injury it’s hard and you can get yourself down. But now that I’m leaving and I can look back, of course it was amazing what we did, and the success I’ve had here. “I was training and a fan called me over and said ‘Thanks for everything. You were amazing for the club. We’ll not forget the memories and you go with our blessing’. It was just a nice touch and the club has been the same. “I can’t thank them enough, for what they’ve done, not only for me, but for my family. My kids were raised here, so it will always have a place in our family, but everything is in the past now. To be successful you can’t really rest. You can’t say ‘I’ve won this, I’ve won that’. It’s time for new things and to be able to do it for Derry would be beyond dreams so that’s the target now.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  -year-old journalism student and film maker, Nathan EdgarDerry NewsNew documentary to shed light on Derry charity Foyle Search and Rescue overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk this evening.

James McClures th minute goal saw the Loup take a healthy six-point lead into the half time break, after the hosts had cut loose during the second quarter. However, St Patricks would not score for another  minutes, and their opponents used the time wisely, chipping away at the lead, with just the goal separating the sides at the second half water break. The Magherafelt side defeated in tonights Jack Cassidy Cup semi final. Loups composure had deserted them and by the time an Eoghan Hawe free reduced the gap to one on  minutes, the side in red looked the more likely winners. Time was on Rossas side, but just as the tide appeared to be turning, Loup rode the wave and hit back, John McClure tapping over a free with five minutes to go to settle the nerves. Aidan McAlynn then slotted another free, and despite a late Magherafelt onslaught that yielded a Dan Higgins point, the hosts held firm to reach a decider against Dungiven. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do. The question I have for Cllr Brown is, has he done likewise .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_TUV.jpg","title":"‘Traditional Unionist’  McKee joins TUV weeks after his UUP departure  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has its first TUV councillor.Harold McKee mdash who recently quit the UUP over concerns about the leadership of the party under Doug Beattie mdash had intended to become an Independent member of the local authority, but has instead joined the TUV.The veteran Mournes councillor and former South Down MLA, says joining Jim Allisterrsquos party presents him with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people across his electoral area.This week, Cllr McKee has thanked the many people who have wished him well on his departure from the UUP and his political direction into the future.He explained that since announcing his resignation, he received an overwhelming number of positive messages of support on social media and via phone calls.ldquoI would take this opportunity to thank all those who took the time to message and telephone me, not only local people in Newry Mourne and Down, but also across the whole of Northern Ireland, said Cllr McKee.ldquoIt is often the case when a member leaves a political party that they receive offers from other parties to have a chat with members or indeed the leader to discuss potential future membership.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park. There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Agreement on the draft lease came at a recent meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillors High Gallagher and Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said plans to signicantly invest in the park will be a ldquogame changer for the South Down area.He said the cocktail of funding which has been secured to finance the revitalisation project will transform the built and natural heritage of the sprawling forest park andact as a huge pull for visitors to the area.Cllr Gallagher said he was delighted that the lease issue had been resolved and that the project was progressing.ldquoAs a Castlewellan councillor, this project is huge and will bring so much benefit to the wider area, he continued.ldquoThis same lease confirmed that the very popular lsquotouring in the treesrsquo permit for touring caravan owners will remain in Forest Service control until the end of . This was an issue that was raised with me and many local businesses in Castlewellan.Cllr Gallagher said that after , the local authority will assume responsibility for lsquotouring in the treesrsquo and that the local authorityrsquos senior management team recognises the importance of this longstanding tradition continuing.Cllr Devlin said that as a Castlewellan resident and a member of the forest park revitalisation project board, agreeing the draft lease represented a huge step, one she described as ldquohugely signicant.She added: ldquoThis project has been underway for many years and so much work, time and effort has been exerted by council officers, all of the ious agencies, elected members and project board chairperson Sally Montgomery.ldquoTo see all of this work now materialise is superb. I more or less grew up in the forest park as a child and it was so disheartening to see its deterioration over the years so this is one particular project that I am very excited about.Cllr Devlin extended a ldquohuge thanks to everyone who played a signicant part in getting the project to this stage and looks forward to seeing further developments on the ground..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Lions go contactless  ","story":"NEWCASTLE Lions Club have invested in a mobile contactless card payment device for use with their Christmas collections.The card reader was purchased with donations from Lions members and will ensure that % of all donations will go to charity.Club president Liz Murphy hopes themachine will be a success and stresses that the mobile card payment will be set for a pound donation.The card reader card can be used as a contactless or pin number device.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede.

Energy costs have just rocketed on the energy markets this year.“It is just down to the vagaries of the market and what really the profit margins are allowed behind that.“In the last  months, we’ve gone from the lowest position to the highest position.”The announcement from Power NI is the latest in a series of price increases made by electricity and gas suppliers in recent months.Giving evidence to a Stormont committee earlier this month, the Consumer Council said the price for heating a home in Northern Ireland rose by % in October.Finance Minister Conor Murphy has called on the Treasury to introduce a VAT exemption on energy bills during the period of surging costs.The spiralling energy prices have also led to calls for the Stormont Executive to introduce emergency measures to protect families who are struggling to pay their fuel bills.Mr French said he was optimistic there would be no price rises until April next year.However, he said that high prices were likely to stay a reality for the coming years.“We’re probably going to see high prices for the next two to three years,the market stays stable,” he said.“The market is just so unpredictable.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Contributors include Lord Trimble, Graham Gudgin, Ray Bassett, Mike Nesbitt, Jeff Dudgeon and News Letter editor Ben Lowry. There is a foreword by Baroness Hoey. The book is available for £. through Blackstaff Press, Amazon and bookshopsAt the back of the dust jacket for ‘The Idea of the Union’ the bottom strap line compares the intellectual case for maintaining the link with the rest of the UK to a fully drawn out test series.“Irish separatist nationalism has had a fair innings. Now it’s time for reason and reality to go to bat,” the editors tell the reader.Twenty contributors go to the crease to hit home the runs for the union in a book which turns out to be as fascinating, eclectic and strategically adept as the first  of any battle-hardened veteran international test cricketing outfit.The collection edited by academics John Wilson Foster and William Beattie Smith  also contain both politico-economic fast and spin bowlers who are capable of dismissing nationalist assumptions as efficiently as the world’s best bowler Trent Boult can dispatch New Zealand’s opponents from the field.The former first mininster of Northern Ireland Lord Trimble. All three leaders of unionism should read this book, and they should certainly read Lord Trimble’s contribution and take heed of his prophetic warning towards the end of itOne of the highlights of this ‘innings’ from the pro-union end of the pavilion comes from the economist Dr Graham Gudgin. His chapter is a particularly devastating ‘over’ that bowls out some of the new smug notions about the Republic’s economy. Dr Gudgin takes to task southern economists who point to higher Irish GDP and the supposed integration of an all island economy as reasons why people would be better off joining an all-Ireland entity rather than opt for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK. On the supposed all island economy Dr Gudgin sticks to facts such as only  per cent of Northern Ireland’s exports going south to the Republic and only  per cent of ROI output of goods and services going into Northern Ireland.Dr Gudgin also argues cogently that living standards in Northern Ireland remain higher in the Republic eventhe latter has one of the highest Gross Domestic Product figures in the EU. He berates those Dublin based economists who do not factor into their calculations the fact that prices especially house prices are far cheaper in the north than the south. Which means households in Northern Ireland get more goods and services still for any given amount of spending.“The result is staggering. It means that after  years as a tax haven and  years inside the EU, the Republic of Ireland has not managed to raise the living standards of its people to Northern Ireland levels,“ Dr Gudgin notes.His deployment of economic facts and statistics is apposite because other essayists in this collection contend that the battleground to save the union must be shted from the traditional ones of faith and crown to hard-headed socio-economic arguments for remaining in the UK.Several deal with the biggest public opinion paradox in Northern Ireland: a falling vote for unionist parties in elections and a consistent majority support for the union in every credible, scientically based opinion poll.In contrast to Gudgin’s forensic demolition of the economics of a united Ireland, David Trimble’s essay is surprisingly painful and personal. It is laced with a sense of betrayal regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Nobel peace prize winner’s anguish over Boris Johnson’s post Brexit betrayal of unionists is encapsulated in two emotionally charged passages on page  which are worth replicating here:“Despite strong opposition within my own community who resented the concessions to those engaged in indiscriminate killing. I campaigned for a Yes vote in the referendum on the Agreement, arguing that it made the Union safe and the future of Northern Ireland was totally in the hands of its people through the ballot box. They put their trust in my assurances and gave me and the Agreement their backing.“That is why I feel betrayed personally by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and it is also why the unionist population is so incensed at its imposition. The Protocol rips the very heart out of the Agreement.”Leaving aside his own distress over the fate of the Belfast Agreement he helped shape and bring into being in , Trimble’s essay is the first detailed analysis of the legal implications of the protocol. Forever the lawyer he reminds the reader that the EU laws which Northern Ireland will have to comply with runs to  pages and contains hundreds of thousands of regulations. Trimble also points out that these future EU imposed laws will govern nearly  per cent of Northern Irish economic activity.All three leaders of unionism should read this book and use it as a tool to rethink their political strategies into the next few decades. Perhaps those in power in London, Dublin and Brussels also might care to dip into this challenging series of essaysthey really want to understand the dangerous tensions bubbling just below the surface of post-Brexit Northern Ireland.They should certainly read Lord Trimble’s contribution and take heed of his prophetic warning towards the end of it.“So, far from keeping the peace, the protocol risks ato violence despite claims from its supporters that it is all about protecting the Agreement.”• ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ is edited by John Wilson Foster and William Beattie Smith.

The main health unions vehemently oppose mandatory vaccination while the Health Minister Robin Swann won’t even agree that patients and their families have the right to ask which staff in a particular care home or hospital are not vaccinated.”It is striking how politics, medicine and much of the media in NI was uncritical of lockdown, yet are reticent around jab compulsion for health and care staff.Dr Tom Black recently talked on BBC Radio Ulster of the need to be respectful of arguments on both sides.

Given that % of adults in NI have had at least one jab it would be remarkabledoctors were anything other than mostly jabbed.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"Billy Wright and Robin Jackson were ‘state agents’ claims BBC documentary   Air Ambulance at ‘incident’ close to building siteNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .
