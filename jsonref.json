Turkey threatens us. In an attack, we can guarantee nothing. \u0027The danger of escape of these jihadists is great, and if it comes to a confrontation with Ankara, then the ISIS fighters will again be an active threat to Europe and the West. \u0027We call for an international conference to discuss this issue that we Kurds can not solve on their own.

Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor          I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’d have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi!

But no evidence was provided to back up the claims of casualties.The government said the action was ordered as India said it had intelligence that Jaish was planning more attacks.Pakistani officials dismissed the Indian claims, saying the Indian aircraft had dropped their bombs in a wooded area, causing no damage or casualties.Villagers near the town of Balakot were shaken from their sleep by the air strikes. They said only one person was wounded in the attack and they knew of no fatalities.\u0027We saw fallen trees and one damaged house, and four craters where the bombs had fallen,\u0027 said Mohammad Ajmal, a 25-year-old who visited the site.A resident, who did not want to give his name, said there was a nearby madrasa Islamic college run by Jaish, though most villagers were guarded in talking about any militant neighbours.JeM is a primarily anti-India group that forged ties with al Qaeda and has been on a U.N. terrorist list since 2001. In December 2001, Jaish fighters, along with members of another Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, attacked India\u0027s parliament, which almost led to a fourth war.           An India\u0027s Border Security Force (BSF) soldier keeps vigil during patrol along the fenced border with Pakistan in Ranbir Singh Pura sector near Jammu          Pakistani reporters and troops visit the site of an alleged Indian airstrike in Jaba, near Balakot, Pakistan. Pakistan said India launched an airstrike on its territory early on Tuesday that caused no casualties, while India said it targeted a terrorist training camp          An Indian police officer fires a teargas shell at Kashmiri Muslim protesters amid simmering tensions in the Kashmir region todayThere has been mounting impatience in India to avenge the February 14 attack, which was the most deadly seen in Kashmir during an insurgency that has last three decades, and as news of the raid broke, celebrations erupted across the country.\u0027I want to assure you our country is in safe hands,\u0027 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said to cheers at a rally in western India hours after the raid. \u0027I won\u0027t let the country down.\u0027Pakistan\u0027s top civilian and military leaders rejected India\u0027s comments that it had struck a \u0027terrorist camp\u0027 inside Pakistan, warning that they would retaliate.

as they are forecast to - then there could be a real crisis for our birds, insects and other wildlife.\u0027The Woodland Trust\u0027s Nature\u0027s Calendar scheme, which asks the public to track signs of the seasons, has been receiving unusually early records of spring this winter - with some as early as November.Mild weather has led to records in January of red admiral, small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies and queen wasps, which are usually seen in mid to late February or early March.Trees including field maples and European larches have been bursting into bud early and blue tits have been spotted making nesting attempts as early as Boxing Day.The latest bout of unseasonably warm weather has seen more than 250 records of brimstone butterflies emerging for the first time since February 12, with 163 of the sightings taking place since Friday.The butterfly normally comes out around March or April, the Trust said.Abi Bunker, director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust, said: \u0027Nature\u0027s Calendar data has increasingly brought into question the way we think about the seasons and to see spring in December no longer seems unusual.\u0027With butterflies, bumblebees and snowdrops being recorded across the festive period, we may have to start featuring different species on our Christmas cards.\u0027But the Nature\u0027s Calendar project is more than just spotting the seasons data sent in by members of the public enables greater understanding of the repercussions climate change has for our beloved flora and fauna, and of the need to act to tackle global warming and other threats to our wildlife.\u0027                          Why spring in February is a disaster for nature: Yes, it\u0027s a joy to see butterflies and blooms burst forth this early in the year... but there may yet be a chilling price to pay, writes JOHN NAISHBy JOHN NAISH FOR THE DAILY MAIL On Sunday afternoon I was sitting in the garden in a T-shirt, taking a break from some urgent pruning. On a fallen tree trunk nearby a Red Admiral was basking, its pulsing wings blissfully warmed by the sun beaming down from a clear blue sky.Just as it did again today — and, if the forecasters are right, for the rest of the week.It is utterly gorgeous — but worrying. It\u0027s only February, for goodness sake! We should all still be shivering in the depths of winter.Instead, this past glorious weekend the roads around my home town of Brighton were rammed with sunseekers heading for the beach.We tried to escape the melee by heading to a quiet country pub. Quiet? We had to queue for a table in the flower-dappled garden. It felt like a May bank holiday.Nature clearly thinks that spring has sprung and then some. Parks and gardens are clad in golden daffodils. Snowdrops are in full bloom on our lawn. Witch hazel and honeysuckles are already emerging.And I\u0027m in a panic about pruning back our rampant fig trees. They should still be sound asleep, but instead they are budding wildly.            Fifteen-month-old Darcy and her mother Kerry enjoy the sunshine and warm weather at Parade Gardens in Bath yesterdayAround Britain the story is the same: some species of camellia are making a premature appearance, patches of wild primroses (usually March to May) and even early cherry blossom (March), while scabious, poppies and Virginia stock have stayed in flower since the summer, having apparently forgotten to die back, thanks to a balmy autumn.The animal kingdom is stirring prematurely, too. Naturalists report that the dawn chorus — not usually heard until March — began at the start of this month.Song thrushes are even belting out their mating calls, while bees have been tricked out of hibernation many weeks early. And as for that butterfly in my garden, well I\u0027ve never spotted one so early in the year before.For this latest burst of unseasonal balm — following a remarkably mild winter — we can thank a plume of warm southerly air sweeping up from the Canary Islands, sending temperatures into the high teens.That is more than twice the normal February average.In London\u0027s Kew Gardens the highs have nudged 18c. \u0027This year is particularly mild,\u0027 says Guy Barter, the chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.\u0027There are a lot of things in flower that you would not expect at this time of the year. Things are running ahead of normal.\u0027Indeed. The Met Office confirmed that today was the hottest February on record as temperatures reached 20.3c in parts of Wales.            A group of women enjoy lunch in the sun at Blyth in Northumberland yesterday as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm dayBut it\u0027s not just the sunny West and South (19c) that\u0027s ablaze. The warmest yet February day in Scotland was recorded last week when Aboyne in Aberdeenshire hit 18.3c on Thursday afternoon.This beats the previous high of 17.9c recorded in Aberdeen in February 1897. (One wonders if they were fretting about climate change back then.)All in all it made for a spectacular weekend for most of us — with the best part of another week of this weather to come — and will be welcome when we get our heating bills. However, the unexpected warmth is sowing much confusion in the natural world and threatens summer harvests, especially for fruit growers.Many of Britain\u0027s plants have evolved to use winter\u0027s cold to their advantage. In the same way that our bodies need eight hours of sleep in each 24-hour cycle, plants need a period of dormancy during the colder months if they are to thrive in spring.This process, called vernalisation, requires a sustained period of cold — which the plants take as an instruction to re-set their biological clocks in preparation for a new healthy annual cycle.For fruit trees, this is not just desirable but vital. Plants such as figs need about 300 chill hours when the temperature is between 0-7c to thrive. Softer fruit such as blackcurrants can require up to 2,000 chill hours to flower at the right time.            A bee takes pollen from a spring bloom in St James\u0027s Park in London yesterdayIf the mild weather persists, fruit trees may flower too early — in March or April. \u0027They would then be vulnerable to a sharp frost that would destroy their blossom,\u0027 warns Barter. \u0027If that happens, they would bear no fruit.\u0027And if apple, pear or blackcurrant plants flower early, they may do so at a time when there are fewer bees about, with a good chance they would not then be pollinated and so would not fruit.It\u0027s a huge worry for orchard owners — as well as Britain\u0027s 40 or so commercial blackcurrant growers, who produce about 14,000 tons of fruit each year.Butterflies may also suffer. The winter of 2015 was a warm one — and what followed was a terrible year for these insects. Cold weather kills viruses and bacteria in the soil that many insects, including native species of butterflies and moths, are high vulnerable to. If temperatures stay relatively high, the microbes can decimate insect populations. Data gathered by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, from more than 1,800 sites across the country over 37 years, shows higher temperatures affected more than half the species, such as the common blue, comma, peacock and small tortoiseshells.There is then a knock-on effect on our native birds which, if they mate and lay eggs early, won\u0027t be able to find enough insects to feed their chicks.Analysis by conservationists of 30,000 nests over the past decade shows birds such as the chaffinch and the robin lay eggs about a week earlier than in the Sixties. A similar pattern has been seen for blue tits, great tits and swallows.And if a proper cold snap should interrupt our mild winter in a month or so, vulnerable chicks could struggle to survive.

May is expected to ask them to endorse her plan to renegotiate the backstop.It is not a new \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 to approve or reject the Brexit deal. Backbench MPs are likely to put forward amendments containing alternative plans - but whatever happens, the stage is set for another showdown on March 12.This is the third time since the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on January 15 MPs have voted on Brexit. May promised the votes would happen as a concession to rebels while she negotiated to stop them taking no deal off the table.  What amendments might there be? Formal amendments have not yet been tabled but they are expected to include:  Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin want to change the law to order the PM to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place by March 13. This would mean suspending the normal rules of the Commons to allow backbench MPs to introduce legislation.Tories Simon Hart and Andrew have a similar amendment that makes a statement the PM should delay Brexit if there is no deal by March 13. There may be a second referendum amendment. Labour has said it will back one as an alternative to no deal or the Tory deal.Tory Alberto Costa is separately pushing an amendment seeking more guarantees for EU citizens in Britain in the event of no deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will table his usual amendment setting out Labour promises for a Brexit based on a permanent customs union with the EU.

She has tried once before on January 15 and lost by 230 votes.The PM has promised this will happen no later than March 12. If she wins then, she has said Brexit should happen on time and the Government will scramble to get the necessary laws in place. What happens if May loses the second vote? May has told MPs they will then have to choose between delaying Brexit for further negotiations or leaving the EU without a deal if the reject the deal by March 12.On March 13, there will be a vote for MPs to say yes or no to no deal.If they say no, on March 14 MPs will be asked to say yes or no to delaying Brexit.If the House also votes no to delay, backbench MPs - backed by Jeremy Corbyn and most Labour MPs - will probably try to push for a second referendum.  Why do people say there needs to be a second referendum?Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal has no majority in Parliament - and it is not clear any other deal has a majority either, even if one could be negotiated.Passing the question back to voters is seen by some as a way to end the impasse and give a clear instruction to politicians on what to do.Some campaigners also say the 2016 referendum was not an informed choice because too many of the implications of Leave were unknown. Britain\u0027s view on whether it should Leave or Remain in the EU is little changed in the more than three years since the referendum. Pictured are the dozens of polls since June 23, 2016  What do critics think?Many people - led by the Prime Minister herself - say a new vote on Brexit would betray the people who voted Leave in 2016. They insist there was a clear order from the public to Leave the EU and politicians must follow it, working out the details for themselves.Unionists also complain that accepting a new referendum on Brexit would pave the way for another referendum on Scottish independence, threatening the future of the UK. Some politicians also feel it would simply reopen the wounds from the 2016 battle without really deciding anything more clearly.  What needs to happen for a referendum to happen?Parliament would need to pass a new law for a referendum to be held. This process alone would take weeks and would likely be very controversial.Before that can even happen, for political reasons there would probably have to be some kind of moment creating a \u0027mandate\u0027 for a new referendum as it is something neither of the main parties promised at the last election.This might be a simple vote of MPs after Mrs May\u0027s deal has been rejected. The Government could call such a vote at any time. Labour also has some opportunities to call a vote - though winning such a vote would have less power.It could even be a whole general election where one or more sides puts a new referendum in their manifesto. What would the question and be who decides? Nobody knows for sure - and this is probably the hardest question of all.Some say it should be a simple repeat of last time, with Leave or Remain on the ballot paper. Others say it should be Remain versus Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.Others advocate a two stage referendum - between Remain and Leave, followed by Mrs May\u0027s deal versus No Deal if Leave wins. Still others say there could be multiple questions on the ballot paper, possible using a ranking system known as alternative vote.The Electoral Commission would make a recommendation and MPs would make the final decision on what the question would be. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/26/14/4FFB1CC300000578-6746889-image-m-17_1551190198108.jpg","title":"Cricket ace Alastair Cook gets knighthood Queen","story":"Cook (pictured left being presented with honour from the Queen today, and right)  became the first England cricketer to be knighted since all-rounder Ian Botham in 2007          Father of three Sir Alastair, 34, (pictured after scoring a century against India last year) retired from international cricket in the summer and ended his career with 12,472 Test runs and 33 Test centuries - both England recordsThe league\u0027s CEO since 1999, he stepped down from the role at the end of last year.Cook became the first England cricketer to be knighted since all-rounder Ian Botham in 2007.He joins an exclusive club of former England cricketers to hold the title, including Jack Hobbs, Len Hutton and Colin Cowdrey.He was also awarded an MBE in 2011 and a CBE five years later.Cook, speaking after the investiture ceremony, said: \u0027Seeing my name up there in whatever capacity - you just don\u0027t get used to it.

She pauses: “I’m not sure what came out.” A moment passes and she adds two dots – beady eyes. “The man and the donkey.”This filmed cameo of the artist at work appears in The Power of the Line, a solo exhibition at Hauser \u0026amp Wirth in London. Brătescu collaborated with the gallery on the exhibition before she died last year, aged 92. The collages and line drawings on show were made during the final decade of her life, when she focused on creating simple geometric forms – both sharply angular and gently curved – based on the line.Brătescu was one of the first conceptualist artists in Romania. Her compositions are reminiscent of Calder’s mobiles, Matisse’s cut-outs and even, at times, Picasso’s cubist women. Her studio was sacred – a safe physical and psychological space in which to experiment and explore ideas that could be sparked by anything, from daily objects to the nubby texture of a piece of paper.Brătescu was born in the city of Ploiești and lived in Romania her entire life. Her seven-decade career was set against an unpredictable and often turbulent time, including the second world war and the Soviet occupation from 1944 to 1958. In the late 40s, she studied literature at at the University of Bucharest and art at the Bucharest Academy of Fine Arts (now the National University of Arts Bucharest). She was expelled from the latter – the Communist party took against her bourgeois upbringing – but writing and drawing continued to be a common thread in her artistic practice.In Hauser \u0026amp Wirth’s gallery on Savile Row, Brătescu’s compositions are curated both chronologically and according to colour. The arrangement brings to mind the springsummer collections on display at nearby clothes shops, but Brătescu’s fluid works are far from seasonal.The eyes flit from one cluster of drawings to the next, the works displayed in horizontal, vertical and stepped configurations. Lines, shapes and silhouettes may be contained within framed sheets of paper but they seem to leap and swirl in the blank space between. No labels identify the works, so you can make of each composition what you will, and each swings between the figurative and the abstract. Patches of pink resemble licking flames while script-like lines entreat you to step closer in an effort to decipher them. Could those acute-angled pink triangles be stiff flags on a still day, origami paper planes, or watermelon, thinly sliced? Two black stripes recall chopsticks, while a curvy stroke and two pink spots hint at the female form. Fluorescent shades nod to Post-it notes – which appear across the room. Brătescu incorporated everyday materials from cardboard coffee stirrers to matchboxes into her work.Her pieces are imbued with both purpose and play. A single streak carries a certain weight and yet, as with the man and the donkey, adding two dots can transform a severe line into a smile. Two films in the centre of the gallery – Linia (The Line) (2014) and The Gesture, The Drawing (2018), made with the Romanian artist Ştefan Sava – reveal her confidence in her creative process. Just as Brătescu knows when something is working – holding her hands in the air and proudly pronouncing it “done” – she knows when to cut and run: “I must tear it apart, I don’t like this one.” (Just in case she were to change her mind, she rips the sheet from her sketchbook, folds it in half and tears it, once then twice.)For Brătescu, the line must have freedom of movement. “Forms are created by dancing with each other,” she says. “They dance – if they do not dance, they grow bored, they die the dead form is thrown away.” She drags a pen across the page in one continuous gesture, letting the nib slip and slide, leaving a trail that is thick and thin. It is captivating, working out, alongside her, what’s next. It’s as if she herself isn’t always privy to that information: “Let’s see what comes to my mind.”It is hard to tear yourself away from this small though lively exhibition, and particularly the second of the two films. Perfectionists might find it hard to watch – will she stick within the lines has she seen that gap? Her studio may have been sacrosanct but, as we can see, her worktop was scattered with pens, rulers, scissors and open-topped sticks of glue. “Do you have the patience?” a bespectacled Brătescu asks, as she colours green a triangular section outlined on white paper. You will do. And when you’re done, you’ll want to walk round the exhibition again until you, too, become part of the continuous performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c170d8e122508778d479dc02818c27c336735384/0_151_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35e88f9d22d4627d238cf704fb88a02b","title":"new philip pullman novel the secret commonwealth book of dust","story":"The second volume of his Book of Dust trilogy finds Lyra now a student, facing adult problems as she travels across Europe and into AsiaSeven years after readers last saw Lyra Silvertongue, sitting on a bench in Oxford’s Botanic Garden, Philip Pullman’s most beloved heroine is set to return as an adult this autumn in the second volume of his trilogy The Book of Dust.Pullman announced on Wednesday that The Secret Commonwealth would be published in October, just ahead of BBC One’s TV adaptation of his bestselling His Dark Materials trilogy, starring Dafne Keen as the child Lyra, Ruth Wilson as the sinister Mrs Coulter and James McAvoy as Lord Asriel.The first Book of Dust novel, La Belle Sauvage, introduces Lyra as a baby, as a huge flood hits Oxford and the 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead becomes her protector. The Secret Commonwealth is set 20 years after those events, and seven years after the end of The Amber Spyglass, the concluding volume in the His Dark Materials trilogy.Lyra is no longer a child and life, warned Pullman, is not easy for this grownup version of a character readers first met as an 11-year-old running wild in Oxford with her daemon Pantalaimon. Now a student, she will travel across Europe and into Asia as she searches for a town said to be haunted by daemons.“Things have been biding their time, waiting for the right moment to reveal their consequences for Lyra Silvertongue,” said the novelist. “The Secret Commonwealth tells the continuing story of the impact on Lyra’s life of the search for, and the fear of, Dust. I found it intriguing and deeply exciting to discover how great events can turn on a little moment, and how revenge can be nurtured and fed and watered till it grows beyond control.”An early extract shows conflict between Lyra and Pan, as the daemon criticises her for being pessimistic. “You used to be optimistic. You used to think that whatever we did would turn out well. Even after we came back from the north, you used to think that. Now you’re cautious, you’re anxious,” he tells her, as the pair deliberate what to do after witnessing a murder. Lyra “knew he was right, but it wasn’t right that he should speak to her accusingly, as if it was something to blame her for. ‘I used to be young,’ was all she could find to say,” writes Pullman.“It was enthralling for me to remember how powerfully and passionately our minds and opinions can be turned by reading a particular book at the right time. Lyra, as a student, is finding that out. She is also discovering a new and difficult aspect to her relationship with Pantalaimon, and other things about daemons that she never suspected,” said the novelist.But, really, Pullman continued, “those things are background”. “At the heart of the book are Lyra, the young woman we saw first as a girl of 12 and then as a baby, and Malcolm, whose life as a boy became involved with hers and who now finds their lives helplessly entangled again and how some emotions can last a lifetime, and others change beyond recognition,” he said. “It’s the story of some people we know, and others we’ll meet for the first time. Their journey is going to take them far from their homeland towards a mysterious desert in central Asia, where they hope to find, at last, the secret of Dust.”The Secret Commonwealth will be published by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House UK on 3 October. The publisher called it “a timely exploration of what it is to be human, to grow up and make sense of the world around us, from one of the UK’s greatest writers”.“Like the original readers of His Dark Materials, Lyra has grown up. Her concerns are adult ones, and this new perspective – coupled with Philip’s unflinching look at the human condition and his extraordinary storytelling – makes for a breathtaking read,” said Penguin Random House Children’s managing director Francesca Dow.Dow compared the book to dystopian classics The Handmaid’s Tale and Never Let Me Go, saying it “shows us a darker parallel world whose troubles echo our own”. Pullman has previously quipped that The Book of Dust should be called “His Darker Materials”.‘It used to be you who was impulsive,’ said Pan, ‘and me who kept holding you back. We’re different now.’She nodded. ‘Well, you know, things change … This isn’t just shoplifting. This is murder.’‘I know. I saw it.’‘And maybe by doing this we’d be helping the murderer get away with it. By interfering with the investigation. That can’t be right.’‘That’s another thing,’ he said.‘You used to be optimistic. You used to think that whatever we did would turn out well. Even after we came back from the north, you used to think that. Now you’re cautious, you’re anxious … You’re pessimistic.’She knew he was right, but it wasn’t right that he should speak to her accusingly, as if it was something to blame her for.‘I used to be young,’ was all she could find to say.He made no response.They didn’t speak again till they reached the station. Then she said ‘Pan, come here,’ and he leapt up at once into her hands. She put him on her shoulder and said quietly, ‘You’re going to have to look out behind. Someone might be watching.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67294250dbc4c17d4e3434123640eb43c0e6df9/0_25_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184ef6d84d8b53820c6611abf2ea150d","title":"persimmon profits help to buy scheme","story":"Builder condemned for making massive gains from taxpayer-funded programmeHousebuilder Persimmon made a record-breaking £1bn profit last year – equal to more than £66,000 on every one of the homes it sold – with almost half of its house sales made through the taxpayer-funded help-to-buy scheme.The York-based builder, which sparked widespread public and political outrage for attempting to pay its former chief executive Jeff Fairburn a bonus of £110m, posted pre-tax profits of £1.09bn.The huge profit – the biggest ever made by a UK housebuilder – means Persimmon banked £66,265 from every one of the 16,449 homes it sold last year. The average selling price was just over £215,000,The profit from each house it sells has nearly tripled since 2013, when the government introduced the help-to-buy scheme in an attempt to help struggling families buy their first home. Last year the company paid an average of just £31,536 for each plot of land, and spent £112,295 on actually building each home. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Persimmon of “pinching their profits from the public purse”, adding: “Far from benefiting first time buyers, the major effect of help-to-buy is to drive up demand while having no effect on supply. The result is not help for those who need it, but a boost to the profits of big developers.”Cable demanded that the government immediately end the help-to-buy scheme and take action to crack down on “outrageous” executive pay. “This greed is coming at the expense of the public purse through the subsidies in help-to-buy,” he said. “Help-to-buy is a scam, enriching developers while forcing buyers off the ladder by pushing up prices.”Greg Beales, the campaign director of the housing charity Shelter, said: “Persimmon represents everything that is wrong with the housebuilding system. The firm has generated huge profits from taxpayer subsidies whilst doing very little to help solve the housing crisis we face.“Piecemeal schemes such as help-to-buy have made the situation even worse by inflating house prices and giving big developers a leg-up – while doing next to nothing to help those most in need of a genuinely affordable home.”Many Persimmon customers have complained that their homes are poorly built, with pipes springing leaks and windows cracking just days after they moved in. Persimmon has been awarded only a three-star Home Builders Federation customer service rating every year since 2014, compared with four and five stars for its major rivals.Victoria Baker, who bought a £380,000 five-bedroom Persimmon house in Ingleby Barwick, near Stockton, last year described the building work on her home as horrific. “We noticed leaks straight away as we were putting things away under the sink there was a pool of water under the sink in the kitchen,” she said. Baker, who lives in a home built by Charles Church, a brand owned by Persimmon, said numerous other leaks later appeared. She is part of a Facebook group called “Charles Church (Persimmon) Homes From Hell”.Persimmon has made so much money in recent years that it triggered a near-£500m bonus bonanza for its 150 most senior bosses. The company’s former chair quit when he recognised that the huge bonuses were wrong, but was unable to prevent them being paid out.Persimmon’s former chief executive Jeff Fairburn was eventually persuaded to give up part of his payout but still walked away with £75m. His replacement, Dave Jenkinson, collected more than £40m.The company’s huge gains from the help-to-buy scheme, in which the government provides a guaranteed interest-free loan, have sparked a ministerial review. James Brokenshire, the housing minister, is said to be “increasingly concerned by the behaviour of Persimmon”.A source close to the minister said: “Given that contracts for the 2021 extension to help-to-buy are being reviewed shortly, which overall is a great scheme helping hundreds of thousands of people into home ownership, it would be surprising if Persimmon’s approach wasn’t a point of discussion.”A government spokesman said officials would “carefully” examine the vast profits made by Persimmon and other housebuilders. “Help-to-buy will look different,” the spokesman said. “We’ve already said it will look only at first-time buyers and we will definitely not be funding leasehold properties. We will look carefully at developer performance over recent years.”Jenkinson, who was appointed Persimmon’s new chief executive on Tuesday, defended the company’s use of the help-to-buy scheme, saying the company had “helped hundreds of first time buyers” and “given them the opportunity to own their own home”. He said the help-to-buy scheme was just one element behind the firm’s financial success and the government had not contacted the company with any concern about its use of the help-to-buy scheme.More than a year ago, Fairburn pledged to set up a charity with a “substantial proportion” of his bonus but has so far failed to do so. He has not registered a charity with the Charity Commission or made any inquiries about how to set one up.Independent property expert Henry Pryor said: “There is no doubt that help-to-buy has been the crack cocaine of the housing industry. Listen carefully and you can hear the housebuilder bosses chortling into their cornflakes as taxpayers pump up the executive bonus pool.“With 100,000 kids waking up in B\u0026ampB accommodation this morning, it’s a national outrage that the government is still pouring accelerant on to the smouldering housing market. Bosses who have trousered the profits from selling to taxpayer-supported buyers have taken the place of bankers on my dart board. They have a business model, thanks to successive governments, that would make Al Capone blush.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df3e4b43e629bf189ddfccf973e412a3cdc331b/998_370_4371_2622/master/4371.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=331061872eb17eefaf94bba5cd75fb03","title":"mps labour brexit vote second referendum jeremy corbyn","story":"As the dust settles on Labour’s announcement this week, major problems emerge. The first is the belief that you can game the system from a desk in Westminster to get the outcome you want. When significant numbers of voters want to leave without a deal at all, a “choice” between May’s deal or remain is not democratic. MPs rightly want to avoid no deal, but to pretend we can settle “the will of the people” when a major, popular option is simply left off the ballot paper treats people as if they are stupid. They aren’t. Why aren’t we learning?The second problem is the message this decision sends to the wider Labour party. Apparently, you can have more impact on Labour policy by leaving the party than by staying in it. For a political party that seeks to govern effectively that is just not sustainable. Above all, none of these elite power-plays deal with the reality already upon us. In towns across Britain, the ongoing uncertainty is already costing jobs. There has been no effort to build consensus for a referendum in parliament, let alone the public. As a short-term tactic it may help the party through a difficult week, but look through a longer lens and the future looks much more fraught than it did a week ago, for us and more importantly for the country.• Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for WiganOver the past three years, thousands of jobs have been lost, hate crimes have rocketed, and real problems such as the housing crisis and NHS underfunding have been neglected while the British political class has been paralysed by Brexit. Labour’s decision to finally listen to its members, young people and what is now a majority of the country could be the first step to putting this sorry saga in British history to an end.A people’s vote is now inevitable, as well as essential. As it stands, just 31 days before Brexit day and after three years of argument, Theresa May’s deal remains deeply unpopular among MPs, and there is broad consensus against the economic catastrophe of crashing out of the EU without a deal, with government ministers prepared to resign imminently if a no-deal Brexit is not taken off the table.The reason consensus has not been reached is that no form of Brexit can live up to the fantasy Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson sold to voters in 2016. The only way to break the logjam and get a clear mandate in favour of a real Brexit deal, or indeed to remain in the EU, is to put the question to the people.Labour now has an opportunity to become the champion of hope and inclusion by proudly and unashamedly becoming pro-European again. After years of lies and false promises, we can be the party that tells the truth. We can offer to fix the inequalities that created the dissatisfaction that caused the result in 2016. We can stand up for workers’ interests, not patronise them by scapegoating Brussels. We can argue that free movement is an opportunity, not an imposition.Just as we have now started to bring the party together again after years of ision, we can do the same for Britain. We can come together again.• David Lammy is Labour MP for TottenhamCall me old-fashioned, but as a democratic socialist I believe politics is about principles. The “democratic” part matters. You make election promises. You keep them. After 22 years in parliament, I thought that was how democracy worked. Straightforward, honest politics.Labour’s first 2017 general election leaflet stated: “Theresa May wants to make this election a re-run of the EU referendum. But the decision to leave has already been settled by the British people.” Labour’s manifesto Brexit chapter was called “Negotiating Brexit” not “Stopping Brexit”. It began: “Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.”Remainers and leavers alike voted for a Labour manifesto which stated: “‘No deal’ is the worst possible deal for Britain.” At conference, Jeremy Corbyn offered to discuss a reasonable deal. Not “the perfect deal”, not only “a Labour deal”, a reasonable deal.Encouraged by Labour MPs, union leaders and Jeremy met the PM more than once. Why bother if compromise was impossible? If you never intended to reach an agreement?Labour’s conference motion promised to “support all options remaining on the table”. Why opt for a second referendum when an improved deal is still within reach? Not a “botched deal”, but a deal worth pursuing.Safeguarding workers’ rights resolving the Northern Ireland border securing a transition period guaranteeing EU citizens’ rights and giving certainty to businesses. This is what is on the table. A second referendum offers only more delay and a nation ided once more.Ditching our election pledge means spurning every Labour leave voter. Our working-class bedrock. Four out of five Tory-Labour marginals, Labour’s 25 most vulnerable constituencies and Peterborough and Newport West – at least one of which faces a byelection – are all leave-voting seats. Do we ignore them, or honour our election promises? I know where I stand.• Caroline Flint is Labour MP for Don Valley"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/926772ec1459a9c73dca36bc6335f03b22884b6f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81d748d2264aa48ff3dff39cabe7c8f3","title":"referendum labour remain vote grassroots","story":"The prospect of a public vote is a triumph for the Labour grassroots. They’ve been preparing for two yearsNo unnamed Labour source can mask what’s happened, and no professional Corbyn-sceptics can derail it. There is now a real prospect of another referendum. Labour has committed to several parliamentary manoeuvres including one final stab at its own Brexit, which will certainly fail another to support Yvette Cooper’s attempt to push no deal further into the realm of destructive fantasy, where it belongs and a vote on an amendment demanding that any Brexit deal approved by the Commons must be ratified in a public referendum. In that public vote, Labour will campaign to remain in the EU.“Sources” within Labour continue to deny this new reality, even as its senior frontbenchers have announced it. “It’s a disgrace,” one told me, “that unelected, unsourced voices are briefing against Labour’s frontbench.” “If they want to speak for the Labour party,” a staffer said, “they should stand for the Labour party.” The position as it stands now is not the seismic shift some suggest. It is a continuation of the policy adopted at Labour’s party conference last September. And credit for it belongs with the grassroots of the Labour party.Jeremy Corbyn’s Euroscepticism has always been overplayed, and absurdly so: this supposedly committed Bennite is a keen supporter of the single market, the core element of transnational cooperation that Tony Benn actually objected to. But more importantly, if you want to understand why so many predictions were wrong, Corbyn’s determination for democratic renewal has been underplayed, to the point of being ignored. The desire to reconnect meaningful levers between the party and its members has always been far more salient to his politics than any old guff about socialism in one country.This isn’t to say there aren’t influential leavers around the leadership, and without Keir Starmer’s determination to stick to both the letter and spirit of September’s conference motion, this may not have been the outcome. Key unions – the TSSA and, lately, the GMB – were significant. Organisations such as Another Europe is Possible and Remain Labour did the legwork of amassing 150 motions on Brexit to take to conference in the first place. Anyone could have lost confidence in the nation’s appetite for remain, without data from Hope Not Hate and Best For Britain. And that ongoing tension many members felt, between despising Brexit as a manifestly far-right project, and wanting to maintain loyalty to a leader whose own preference was endlessly interpreted but often unclear, was bridged by Momentum. It was highly ambivalent on Europe but ultimately, also, more committed to party democracy than to a position on any single issue.Yet this new context in which we find ourselves, a real prospect of a public vote to swim out of this godforsaken Tory swamp, is a triumph of Labour members.This is important not because of any crowning determination to see credit situated where it is due – rather than ascribed, wildly, to the Independent Group. Rather, because if you want to actually know what a ratification vote would look like, and the remain campaign within it, this is no sudden scramble to put together some arguments and hope they’re different enough to the self-interested status quoism of the Stronger In campaign of 2016. Labour’s members have been working on a strategy for two years.The arguments split three ways: what does remain and reform actually mean, in terms of our relationship with the EU, and our hopes for the continent? What were the real problems unmasked by the referendum result, and what would it take to solve them? And finally, wouldn’t it be inspiring to put these tired, abstract, 60s arguments behind us and concentrate on things that matter?The left in Europe need us, and we need them. We need one another to create the first carbon-free continent, and fast. We need to fight the rise of the far right together, for so many obvious reasons, not least the paradox that violent ethno-nationalists are working tirelessly across borders to cooperate with one another, and no single nation can meet that threat working alone. We need a transnational union movement, a financial transaction tax, an enforceable floor for corporation tax between countries we need an entire constellation of cooperative measures so that no multinational can get its fingers burned over poor working conditions in Munich and immediately move to Kraków, or Stoke.We need to defend such laws and regulations as were co-created along humane and social principles, and unpick the elements of the Lisbon treaty that sought to detach the market from democratic forces and regulatory oversight. The only progressive European voice I have ever heard supporting Brexit did so on the grounds that the UK was so often the impediment to action on climate, or on workers’ rights, that the continent would be better off without us. If we have any ambitions of our own as a force for renewal, or any sense of solidarity in reforming a European project whose negative elements we partly created, we cannot accept that.“Fix Britain instead” was the slogan for a second referendum suggested by Tom Kibasi, the head of the IPPR thinktank. Its Prosperity and Justice inquiry last year drew together a set of realities that would be enough to make anybody angry: pathetic wage growth, housing inequality, income inequality, wealth inequality, high household debt, weak government investment, poor research and development, and a tax system that doesn’t meet the needs of public services or the demands of social justice. None of this was driven by EU membership. All of it is more pressing, more meaningful and more within our grasp than any change to our relationship with the EU, which we have seen not just de-prioritise but obliterate the national agenda.There is some overlap between the third argument – let’s move on – and the first two, yet it warrants its own category, because the appetite for it is just so strong: the almost unbearable lightness of being able to say no to more of this bilge no more colonial fantasists no more throwbacks invoking fake passions about the second world war no more feckless aristocrats flapping their hands and saying, “It’s fine for that factory to close, manufacturing is so last century and besides, it would have closed anyway” no more nonsense about superiority and dominance and prowess, while trade deals unravel before they’ve even been stitched no more chancers taking crash courses in French geography, or Irish history or Chinese diplomacy in real time. Let’s just move on, and talk about things that are real. This is how a remain campaign will be fought, and this is how it will be won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/189d7a784b47aa1d11a758f4b172c9d2f6837129/0_296_3613_2167/master/3613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec6c9245e923a01dd0579891f53df24f","title":"the guardian view on mays brexit coming not together but apart","story":"The prime minister’s manoeuvring is about stifling – rather than giving voice to – antagonisms in her party. The same can be said of LabourThe government of Theresa May has survived another parliamentary cliffhanger, with a vote that threatened a cabinet walkout almost certainly shelved. She remains in office – to procrastinate another day. The prime minister did so by admitting she has a plan B if her deal to leave the European Union does not win Commons support in a meaningful vote before 12 March. Mrs May’s strategy is now to say that if her deal is defeated she will offer MPs something she has so far refused to countenance: asking the EU to extend the deadline set by the article 50 process of leaving the bloc by a couple of months. She also told MPs that the United Kingdom “will only leave without a deal on 29 March if there is explicit consent in this House”.Mrs May does not want to extend the Brexit talks. What is not clear, and is an act of political irresponsibility, is whether she would vote against a no-deal Brexit – which would inflict serious damage to the economy but appeals to the fanatics in her party. The prime minister seems to think that by extending article 50 she can offer MPs a choice at the end of June that they would have already rejected: between a version of her Brexit deal and no deal. Mrs May is treating high office as if it were a battering ram, using it to hammer again and again at her opponents until they crack. She says she wants her government to “implement” the 2016 Brexit poll “in a way that commands the support of this House”. MPs, however, have yet to coalesce in a large enough group around a single plan. Parliamentarians are not coming together, they are coming apart.Like Britain, the Conservative party is split down the middle over Brexit. Mrs May obscures this reality by talking up the prospects of negotiations with Brussels over her withdrawal agreement. She aims to continue in this vein until the summer. Mrs May will use the perception of motion – shuttling between London and Brussels – to give the impression she is getting somewhere. In reality she will be going nowhere. The withdrawal agreement, a legally binding treaty, is not going to be rewritten – though material could be added to the accompanying political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and Britain. Mrs May is in search of changes to her deal that will be big enough to bring her rebels on board – as well as luring Labour MPs to her camp – and small enough for the European Union to accept. The Tory party ide is unlikely to be bridged. In that sense Mrs May’s Brexit diplomacy is a substitute for a predicament that serves only to defer it.Mrs May’s manoeuvring is about stifling – rather than giving – voice to antagonisms in her party. The same can be said of Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn. His party is also ided over how to proceed over Brexit, with the membership pushing for a second referendum on the issue. Mr Corbyn has committed himself to a “confirmatory vote” but made progress to it contingent on an improbable sequence of events. Paraded as a noble expression of national dispute, his policy in reality is a repression of it.For parliament there seems no imaginable route of escape from the Brexit straitjacket. The danger is that the public is being lulled into the idea that the apparently impossible would prove possible somehow. Denial for both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn has worked until now but it is increasingly reckless, especially for the prime minister. The causes of Brexit are still with us, with levels of inequality and poverty rising. Mastering the mechanics of politics is not enough. Politicians need to master its substance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ea7161ad492e9c547c5c11df6808eb0e7575ba/0_0_941_571/master/941.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae48e6c0f6a35864b45f70167a485c5b 940w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

Older taxis and private hire vehicles will pay £7.50 each, and from 2023, vans and minibuses will also be charged £7.50.But cars will be exempt after the GMCA decided levying a charge against private drivers would disproportionately affect poorer people who could not afford to upgrade their vehicles.Alex Ganotis, the leader of Stockport council and lead for clean air, said: “Including private vehicles would have hit, disproportionately, our poorer communities.”Ganotis said including private hire vehicles would necessitate a national scrappage scheme to help people trade in their old vehicles – something the government has ruled out.Pete Abel from Manchester Friends of the Earth said: “Not including private vehicles in the clean air zone is a cop-out. Our children need us to take urgent action now – 2024 is too late.”Burnham insisted the decision was not a political calculation designed to save him 285,000 votes. “In our judgment, it would have been disproportionate to hit people with often the least ability to change their car, when we know that these proposals can achieve compliance by 2024,” he said.At a press conference in Manchester on Tuesday, Burnham played a video filmed at St Ambrose primary school on Princess Parkway, one of the busiest and most polluted streets in Greater Manchester.In it, the headteacher talked about being able to taste the pollution and lamented that she always had to keep the front-facing windows shut because the air was so dirty.Burnham said he had never forgotten visiting the school. “A young lad with asthma told me that often he couldn’t play football outside with his mates because of the air pollution,” he said.A local group in Levenshulme, one of the most polluted suburbs in south Manchester, said it was also disappointed by the exemption of private cars.“We’re pleased to finally see proposals to address our air pollution crisis in Greater Manchester, but it’s disappointing that charging on the most polluting cars has been ruled out,” said Jen O’Brien from Clean Air Levenshulme.“Dirty air disproportionately impacts the health of the poorest communities, children and the elderly – urgent action is needed to limit the dirtiest vehicles travelling in and to the city centre, and that should include cars, ensuring healthier air for everyone sooner.”Other cities introducing clean air zones are not exempting private drivers. Birmingham will charge £8 a day for cars and £50 for buses, HGVs and coaches.Clean air zones are being introduced by cities across the UK after the government ordered more than 60 local authorities to produce and implement plans to bring NO2 limits within legal limits “in the shortest possible time”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f82819344ee9251e602e917f645da10a305d65/0_780_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8887abd433add62e35b5da8735d73876","title":"specieswatch farmers britain disappearing earthworms","story":"Song thrush and soil fertility under threat from decline of surface-dwelling wormsThere are three types of earthworm: those that live on the surface, others that feed and dwell in the soil, while a third group makes deep burrows and comes to the surface to feed on dead leaves.All are vital to the soil health, providing nutrients and drainage, so it is concerning when they are scarce or absent on farmland.Particularly at risk are epigeic earthworms (surface dwellers), which have vanished in some fields in Britain due to intensive farming practices, mostly excessive tillage and overuse of chemicals.Their disappearance means poor soil fertility, lower crop yields and loss of carbon from the soil, a factor exacerbating climate change. It also partly explains the crash in the song thrush population, which relies on this type of worm to feed its young in the spring.Researchers asked farmers to dig pits in their fields and count the number of worms of each type they found. The average field had nine per spadeful, but the best fields with healthy soil had three times that number.

I wanted to do something much more masculine,” the designer said. With success came a bigger budget and at last the opportunity to buy more expensive fabrics and textiles, he added.With this collection, his tailoring has moved beyond the traditional to incorporate oversized pockets, leather culottes and utilitarian waistcoats. Belted coats in leopard print, structured oversized knits and long asymmetrical dresses worn over palazzo trousers came with the easy, laissez-faire attitude that makes his clothes so wearable. “What I show is what I sell,” he said.There was also a lot of fun. One shirt and trouser combination in “the blue of David Hockney” was styled with earrings featuring a childhood photograph of Jacquemus, his brother and his mother in a swimming pool, which customers will be able to customise. Elsewhere, large padded bumbags punctuated polished looks.The set was inspired by his love of French cinema, taking on the form of a town square with florists, grocers and boulangeries. He may be eschewing the direct sartorial references to the romanticism of the riviera but he still knows how to work the aspirational lifestyle of the region to his advantage.Prints incorporated hand-drawn sketches of ceramic pots you might pick up in a Sunday morning flea market, while a cream trouser suit was adorned with appliqué tulips.Despite his age, Jacquemus has been around the block. After making his fashion week debut in October 2012, he was shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH prize, winning the special jury accolade the following year.However, he had been designing for years before that. A video recently surfaced of Jacquemus early in his career, dressing friends in his clothes and crashing a French Vogue consumer event in the French capital to present his designs to the then fashion editor, Emmanuelle Alt.It is this youthful confidence that permeates every aspect of his brand, and with this collection he shows he is not afraid to carve his own path rather than play to the Instagram crowd. Jacquemus revealed on Monday that the change of direction had been hard but he was happy with the results.Given that the French leg of the autumnwinter fashion weeks stretches for nine days, it is confirmation of his popularity and selling power that so many editors, buyers and other industry heavyweights arrived for day one to be present at his show.Jacquemus told Fantastic Man magazine last year that he had been approached by a global French fashion house, among many others, to become its head designer, but turned the offer down.“I don’t need the stamp of approval that comes from working for a big house … I have a big house: Jacquemus is my house and now I want to take it somewhere.”This collection showed his determination and dexterity at doing so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c449e060c81f8874fb06b6c58aee3777f571b54/0_4_2956_1774/master/2956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=432c6b919f98a029b3137cced047b87a","title":"project loud france rihanna new fashion label name and funding","story":"The singer’s upcoming brand, created with French conglomerate LVMH, is named after her album, Loud, and will receive €60m in investmentIn January, it was announced that Rihanna would become the first black female designer to have a label as part of the LVMH conglomerate. This week, it was revealed that the project has a name and multi-million euro funding.This information was obtained by The Business of Fashion, who have had access to documents detailing the company’s set-up. This is the first new brand the group has launched since Christian Lacroix in 1987. According to an article on their website, Rihanna has invested €2,998,800 (£2,571,000) while LVMH have brought €30m (£25m). This suggests there are high hopes that a Rihanna fashion brand is a project worth investing in. It has also been reported that Project Loud France is registered at the same address as LVMH Fashion Group, which looks after brands including Celine, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs.This faith isn’t, of course, just based on the reach of a celebrity. Rihanna’s ability to connect with millennials and Gen Z consumers has been tried and tested in both beauty and fashion. Her Fenty Beauty line – which pioneered ersity by having first 40 and then 50 shades of foundation to cater to different skin tones – had consumers queuing outside stores to buy products. The brand reportedly generated $100m (£75m) in the first 40 days after launch. It was first launched by Kendo, the LVMH initiative to develop beauty brands.While her entrepreneurism is impressive, Rihanna’s star power is also part of the package here. She has 67.9m followers on Instagram, where she regularly shares images of herself in outfits including a ruffle cocktail dress or a snakeskin dress and matching bucket hat. The direct connection with her fans saw her crowned “Most marketable celebrity” in 2016. The NPD Group, who conducted the research, judged that Rihanna’s followers would be 3.7 times more likely to buy something seen on her account than that of other celebrities.LVMH are working on a new brand with French designer Nicolas Ghesquière, too. This is likely to pique fashion insiders’ interests. Ghesquière is also creative director of Louis Vuitton. Like Project Loud France, the date of this launch is unknown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4942c87b75e90e47b001575d27a005d6f8996dd3/2_0_8529_5120/master/8529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fdb6370b6857d8d02c1eb57a1daeb73","title":"the joy of necks why everyones wearing high necklines","story":"Polo necks have been to this decade what miniskirts were to the 1960s. And, from the Oscars to the catwalks, the high-collared silhouette still reigns supremeWhen one look unites the Oscars, fashion weeks across two very different cities and the legacy of two fashion superstars – Karl Lagerfeld and the American socialite Lee Radziwill – well, then we have ourselves a bona fide trend.The real fashion takeaway from Gemma Chan’s Valentino Oscars dress wasn’t the flamingo pink, but the elongated ruffled neck. The high collar ruled the night. Olivia Colman’s stately forest-green Prada dress had a polo neck, as did the va-va-voom Tom Ford sheath worn by Jennifer Lopez. Likewise, the avant-garde structured black tunic chosen by Helen Lasichanh, the very chic wife of Pharrell Williams, and Irina Shayk’s dramatic open-back black dress. Very different gowns, but all with a to-the-chin neckline.The high-fashion high neck is snowballing momentum. When Radziwill died on the first day of London fashion week, fashionista Instagram feeds were full of images of her: in a white polo neck under a blazer on the streets of Paris, with a silk scarf wound tight and high around her neck in the front row of a New York show. And then, as if by osmosis, the same outlines seeped on to the catwalks. At Victoria Beckham’s show the first look, with a red foulard whisked around the neck above a shoulder-robed windowpane blazer, had a cool east coast chic of which Radziwill would definitely have approved. At Erdem, swan-necked polo necks under bejewelled cashmere cardigans were worn with low kitten heels. Very recently retired ballerina very Radziwill. At Roksanda, the ultra-high necklines of evening dresses were accentuated with a collar of feathers.The death of Lagerfeld threw a long shadow – complete with distinctive high-collared silhouette – over Milan fashion week. At Fendi, where Lagerfeld designed for 54 years, the exaggerated pointed collars, starched high-rise necklines and starched bows had models adopting Lagerfeld’s signature pose of a haughtily uptilted chin on the catwalk. But the high neckline was not just a homage to Karl. At Gucci, models wore spiked chokers with polo neck sweaters or above a shirt and tie. These will not go on sale – “a little dangerous”, designer Alessandro Michele explained in his post-show press conference – but were there to emphasise the neck as the focal point of this season’s look. At Versace, the 90s-party-girl classic of a tissue-weight T-shirt under a slip dress was revived, but with polo necks wrinkling right up to the ears under lace-trimmed minis.It is now necklines, not hemlines, that make headline news in fashion. When the economist George Taylor invented the Hemline Index in 1926, theorising that short skirts reflected a buoyant economy, his logic was that in more affluent times, women choose shorter hemlines to show off their silk stockings when times are lean, they want longer skirts to cover up the lack of them.Given that “showing off your silk stockings” went out before shillings and pence – and bearing in mind that the esteemed fashion historian Valerie Steele dated the debunking of the hemline index back to 1927, when hemlines began to fall two years before the stock market crash – it is amazing how long the index has hung on as urban legend. (Also, a bit patronising: “You are only girls and can therefore only talk about the economy if we explain it in terms of pretty dresses.”) Fashion has ersified to the point where there is no dictated skirt length any more. Longer skirts have dominated catwalks for most of the past decade, but not exclusively – see Balmain – and rather than the stock market, the shift reflects a more globalised fashion economy that serves non-western cultural norms, and the growing profile of older women as customers.The polo neck has been to this decade what the miniskirt was to the 1960s. In March 2011, Phoebe Philo put a white polo neck on her Celine runway and put the high, sleek neckline back on the map. Polo necks have been layered under crew neck sweaters, hoodies and cotton shirts. The stand-up neckline has even spawned a new hairstyle: the polo neck tuck, where hair is funnelled inside a knit, turning long hair into a quasi-bob. After reigning over us for eight years, the high neck might be expected to be on the slide – instead, it is coming into its prime. The high neck is no longer a quiet underlayer, but the main event. Those Gucci spikes won’t be coming to a high street near you any time soon, but look out for a silk scarf wound into an elaborate bow, or a starched Karl-esque evening blouse, or a collar of feathers, or a zipped-to-the-chin funnel neck bomber.A neckline has always spoken of status. Think of the white roman collar, or dog collar, worn by priests. The old school tie. The string of pearls. The white collar, and the blue. Your dress can be whatever length you like because it’s what happens at the throat that counts. This season, it’s time to put your neck on the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e37a76314a6def7e10dff8c5541eeb369e4f715/0_97_4760_2855/master/4760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894249ff9fa4016aac58f726e2f4ac0f","title":"yves saint laurent takes inspiration from deneuve for paris","story":"A month to the day after Catherine Deneuve auctioned 130 of her one-of-a-kind Yves Saint Laurent pieces for €1m (£860,000) at Christie’s in Paris, it seems apt that his label’s autumnwinter 2019 show in the French capital should be inspired by the actor.Deneuve was joined by two more of the house’s forever muses, Betty Catroux and Bianca Jagger (specifically in the 1980s), and their “sophisticated and liberated spirit” as inspiration for the show, according to Saint Laurent’s current creative director, Anthony Vaccarello.As a result, the 103-look collection – 18 of which were menswear – remained loyal to the glitzy, power-shouldered silhouette it is distinguished by and that this season Vaccarello took to the extreme. “Everything starts from the shoulder, so I work around the shape of that,” he said, pointing to the exaggerated shoulders and substantial asymmetric swathes that stood almost independently, yet protectively, from the body.He added of his Saint Laurent woman: “She’s not a warrior, she’s not mean, she’s just confident.”Other Saint Laurent hallmarks were also present, such as the iconic le smoking jacket, which came as a classic with silk lapels as well as reworked into a black patent mac and a long dress. The latter will likely prove a hit on the red carpet – where the label regularly appears – thanks to it drawing the fine line between empowerment and sensuality. Meanwhile, the masculine military-style wool coats that opened the show in grey, white and black, showed that it wasn’t just about clothes for a special occasion.Staged in a giant mirrored box erected in the Fontaine du Trocadero against the glittering backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, Vaccarello created something of a light show of his own. Inside, a lightrod installation behind two-way mirrored glass was on such a large scale that it rivalled the lights of the famous landmark outside.The second part of the show, in which models walk in UV light on the other side of the giant screens did, however, serve more than a creative purpose. Under an ultraviolet lens, the new line of flouro shoes that the brand is introducing for next season seemed to walk themselves, making the footwear the most memorable takeaway from the collection.It was a savvy move given Vaccarello’s form for creating the most lusted after shoes of seasons past. The slouchy, thigh-high boots covered in 3,000 rhinestones on each foot, which he designed in 2017 and which went viral after Rihanna wore them, were on waiting lists around the world despite their $10,000 (£7,545) price tag. Saint Laurent will be hoping that they help them make their revenue target of €2bn by 2022, which CEO Francesca Bellettini said last November they were on track to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Leicester’s manager ran the rule over his new charges as they secured their first home win since Boxing Day thanks to goals by Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy.Davy Pröpper pulled one back but, if Leicester are looking up again, Brighton cannot be comfortable about being only three points above Southampton, who occupy 18th place.While it would be easy to claim Leicester were inspired by Rodgers’s presence, gifts from Brighton were a major factor. Chris Hughton’s side started limply and, after rallying, finished badly, with Glen Murray guilty of two uncharacteristic misses.Still, there is no doubt the arrival of Rodgers has raised the mood at Leicester. He watched from the directors’ box from where he beamed and waved when given a rapturous greeting from the crowd before the kick-off.Apparently the players are similarly enthused by his appointment. “He came into the dressing room after the game and he was very positive,” said Mike Stowell, who, along with Adam Sadler, was in temporary charge for this match. “The lads were in awe listening to him,” Stowell continued. “He said: ‘I’ve only left Celtic to come here for one reason and that’s to work with this group of players.’ That speaks volumes for this young group.”Harry Maguire said: “It’s an exciting time for the club. We all know his profile and what he’s done. We’re all looking forward to working with him. Celtic are a massive club, so it shows how big Leicester are getting and our ambitions.”Leicester’s ambition before taking on Brighton was to end a series of four straight defeats. Having spoken of his desire to create a “really aggressive” side, Rodgers must have appreciated the way the hosts got stuck in. Then again, they could hardly have asked for more obliging visitors, as Brighton began with a timidity that showed why they are among the Premier League’s worst travellers, without an away win since a narrow victory at Huddersfield in early December.Scoring the opening goal, which Leicester repeatedly failed to do under Puel, was an ideal way to greet a new dawn. Vardy, one of the player’s hoping to benefit most from Puel’s departure, had a chance to land the first blow when James Maddison pulled the ball back to him in the fifth minute but Shane Duffy threw himself in front of the striker’s shot from the edge of the six-yard box.Leicester were not denied, merely delayed. Five minutes later they made the breakthrough thanks to Gray. Hughton must have been aghast at how feebly his team defended after Harvey Barnes dispossessed Anthony Knockaert near halfway. Youri Tielemans ran free from midfield before slipping a pass through to Gray, who was free to fire low into the net from 15 yards.He nearly doubled his tally four minutes later after Barnes again made gains down the left. Mat Ryan got down well to save.As Brighton pulled themselves together, Leicester became a little dishevelled. Kasper Schmeichel made two important saves, first from Pascal Gross and then an excellent one-handed stop to thwart Knockaert.Leicester should have been punished early in the second half when Maddison was caught in possession but, after a lovely move involving Knockaert and a back‑heeled pass by Gross, Murray lifted the ball over from eight yards. Worse, Gross suffered a hamstring injury when performing his nifty tee-up.Moments later Leicester eased their anxiety with a classy goal. Advancing nimbly from midfield they cut through Brighton, Vardy applying the finish by running on to a clever pass by Maddison and ramming the ball past Ryan from 10 yards.Leicester were not comfortable for long. Three minutes later Pröpper cut their lead in half, firing low into the net from edge of the box after Knockaert’s cross from the right was deflected into his path by Ben Chilwell.Barnes had a brilliant game on the left wing but missed two decent chances on the counterattack. Brighton’s best chance to equalise fell to Murray in the 87th minute but the normally trusty striker again misfired, blasting wide from seven yards.“At the moment we’re not putting away opportunities and so we have to make sure we’re not conceding,” Hughton said. “Those small margins are not going for us at the moment and it’s only us that can do something about it.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/186e3c893a7dc0cc7ff381fefd36304758a497f5/0_0_2452_1471/master/2452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7be3e65be9119b1223d1504061fd1a15","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp premier league title race","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said this season’s title challenge is the first of many for Liverpool and his players deserve more credit for the form that has taken them top of the Premier League.The manager believes his team’s recent performances have been unfairly compared with those of other title contenders, saying hopes are magnified by Anfield’s craving for a first league championship since 1990. “No plant grows as quick as expectations here,” said Klopp, whose side hold a one-point lead over Manchester City going into Wednesday’s home game against Watford.Liverpool have drawn three of their last four league matches and Klopp himself expressed disappointment with Sunday’s stalemate at an injury-hit Manchester United. But title pursuits rarely run smooth, insisted Klopp, who believes the experience will benefit everyone at Anfield regardless of how the campaign finishes.“One generation has to break through, to make it happen, and then for the rest it will be easier. It would be nice if we could be that. The development of this team is unbelievable. Not that I praise myself or whatever, but it is unbelievable. We played three finals. I know in the world outside it looks like finals are nice, all perfect, then you don’t win and nobody thinks about it, but I don’t know a lot of teams that have been in three finals in the last three years. We improve constantly in the table.Klopp maintained he is “happy with a lot of moments” in this calendar year and the scrutiny placed on Liverpool is more intense than that on their title rivals. He added: “It’s like you get an eye problem when you have to watch our football now compared to when we played such wonderful football a few weeks ago. Sorry for that disappointment. It is the job to do.“Do other teams perform constantly? They don’t. Sometimes they have the result but we don’t look at them in detail, we just see they are winning. You only have this obsessed look on our football. Yes, there were moments when I wish we would fly a bit more but you don’t fly because you want to fly. You fly because you work for it.“I know I didn’t look like I enjoyed the second half at United but that’s how it is – it’s hard work. If the mood drops a little I understand it is my job to kick a few asses. Then after the game it’s over and we go again. Why is it such a problem for us to win 1-0? When we win 1-0 we have to explain why we don’t fly or score like last year. If we draw we have to explain why we don’t win 1-0. Something is always wrong and that is a bit of a problem, not for us internally, but that makes things not easy to enjoy sometimes.”Jordan Henderson was on the receiving end of Klopp’s anger on Sunday for not shaking his manager’s hand when substituted. “It was a pure misunderstanding,” Klopp said.Roberto Firmino has an outside chance of playing against Watford, despite leaving Old Trafford on crutches with an ankle injury. Scans revealed no serious damage and the striker has “a big chance” of facing Everton on Sunday, according to his manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890c96de7094fe5495dacd350984cf18c3e0e8c2/0_128_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c0cc5aa5483a0219c96da44821b9ee","title":"newcastle burnley premier league match report","story":"Much more of this and Newcastle will soon be fronting an advertising campaign promoting the restorative powers of winter breaks in southern Spain.Annual trips to Rafael Benítez’s preferred bolthole near Alicante certainly seem to help immunise the Tyneside club against relegation. After in effect securing their Premier League status courtesy of three straight wins following last year’s mini-break, Newcastle have returned from their latest visit to the Costa Blanca and promptly taken six vital points, from Huddersfield and now Burnley.While goals from Fabian Schär – with an outstanding strike – and the excellent Sean Longstaff lifted Newcastle into the sunlit uplands of 13th place they also reminded Sean Dyche that all good things must come to an end.Burnley’s manager had never previously lost a Premier League match on a Tuesday and his team arrived unbeaten in the league in 2019 and on a run of eight league games without defeat, their best top-tier run for 53 years. “Credit to Newcastle, they were better than us,” Dyche said. “They deserved to win.”Benítez was delighted by his side’s ability in the face of Burnley’s physicality. “There were a lot of positives,” said a manager whose demeanour hints he may extend a contract that expires in May. “We trained really hard in Spain and I was confident we could finish stronger. Now we have to be confident we have a project and ambition to be a top Premier League side. We can do it.”Although configured in a fluidly attacking 3-4-3 formation Newcastle started slowly. Bar one gorgeous raking diagonal pass from Longstaff – a young midfielder set to be called up to the England Under-21s before possibly joining the fast track to Gareth Southgate’s seniors – and a first-time Matt Ritchie cross that narrowly failed to find Salomón Rondón, the hosts created little of note.Or at least not until the 24th minute. With a single swipe of his foot, Schär changed the game. After collecting the ball from Javier Manquillo the central defender found himself around 30 yards out and took aim. The resultant angled shot swerved wickedly away from Tom Heaton, the visiting goalkeeper helpless as it came off the inside of a post before dropping into the net. Even Dyche seemed nonplussed.Burnley’s manager had cut a vocal, demonstrative presence in the technical area but his game plan was soon to go further awry as Longstaff scored his first senior goal. It arrived courtesy of a fabulous cross from Ritchie – outstanding at left wing-back – with which Rondón could not quite connect, leaving the ball to drop for the academy graduate from North Shields. All that remained was for Longstaff to swivel smartly before driving an angled volley into the bottom corner.As he was serenaded with “one of our own” choruses, Dyche complained about Craig Pawson’s failure to award his side a free-kick for what he saw to be a foul on Jack Cork in the buildup.With Burnley’s recently dependable defence increasingly destabilised by Miguel Almirón’s searing change of pace and the energy of the unwell Ashley Westwood much missed in their midfield, the visitors’ unbeaten run looked in severe jeopardy. Even so they could and should have reduced the deficit as half-time neared when the ball fell kindly for James Tarkowski about six yards out. Showing why he is a centre-half rather than a centre-forward, he volleyed wildly off-target.Dwight McNeil has been a key figure in Burnley’s recent renaissance but struggled here and was replaced on the left of midfield by Robbie Brady at the interval. Dyche’s players subsequently improved slightly but not sufficiently and could have fallen further behind when Heaton saved smartly from Almirón with his legs.Burnley’s manager replaced the well-marshalled Ashley Barnes with Peter Crouch but the incoming striker’s most notable achievements were to collect a booking for catching Schär on a shin and then leaving Mo Diamé with a bandaged head after accidentally elbowing him above an eye.“Some of our quality was lacking,” said Dyche, whose side are 15th and remain within touching distance of safety. “But we’ll be back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35d97c6eb7d4856635c03ce8dd17d7c5b56b3b09/262_177_4106_2464/master/4106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c2414b541d7482c1b9ec5ec546fb33","title":"2019 womens world cup 100 days to go","story":"From match tickets and game locations to potential stars of the future and England v ScotlandIt is now only 100 days until the Women’s World Cup kicks off in France on 7 June. Preparations are advancing apace and our guide can help you navigate the tournament.Who, when and where, and other useful logistics Twenty-four teams, including England and Scotland, compete across nine cities – Paris, Reims, Valenciennes, Le Havre, Rennes, Montpellier, Nice, Grenoble and Lyon – from 7 June to 7 July. Lyon hosts the semi-finals and the final.So what about tickets? Inidual match tickets go on general sale on Thursday March 7 at 3pm. They can be purchased from Fifa and range in price from €13 to €84 per game.Why are the final stages in Lyon? Lyon houses an outstanding women’s club team, arguably Europe’s best, starring, among others, England’s Lucy Bronze. “In Paris it’s really difficult to make people come to women’s sports events,” admits Brigitte Henriques, the vice president of the French Football Federation. “And we wanted to recognise Lyon’s work. Lyon leads women’s football in the world.”Is it on television in the UK? Yes, the BBC has the rights and will cover every game via television, radio, its website or a mixture of all three.Is France safe? Terrorism is the biggest concern but the enduring anti-government Gilets Jaunes – or yellow vests- protests – could disrupt travel. The latest UK Foreign Office travel advisory states: “Terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats by Islamist terrorist groups the French government has reinforced its security measures and warned the public to be especially vigilant.” Fans can expect airport-style checks at grounds.Will the referees be any good? Standards should be much improved. The 27 referees and 48 assistants attended an extended winter training camp in Doha, Qatar, where leading officials, including Germany’s Bibiana Steinhaus, were put through their paces and fully briefed on VAR deployment.So who are the favourites? The USA, coached by the English-born Jill Ellis, are defending champions and remain strong. France, managed by Corinne Diacre, who previously impressed during a stint in charge of second-tier men’s side Clermont, should not be underestimated either. In January, France comfortably beat the USA 3-1. Germany have been in transition but retain some top players while Japan were runners-up in 2015 and winners in 2011 and the Netherlands are Euro 2017 holders. Then there’s England.How might England do? Hard to say. Under the tactically clever Mark Sampson the Lionesses finished third at Canada 2015 before reaching Euro 2017’s semi-finals. Phil Neville is now in charge and presiding over his first major tournament. Neville preaches an attractive, attacking, passing game and would ideally like to turn England into a female version of the Manchester United side he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson. In reality, his aim of winning the World Cup may entail unlocking his inner-Sampson and turning a little more pragmatic.A comprehensive 2-0 friendly home defeat to Sweden in November indicated a need for a plan B. Yet England should progress from an initial group also featuring Scotland, Japan and Argentina – not least because Argentina are surely the tournament’s weakest side. If the Lionesses will miss the injured Jordan Nobbs’s midfield talent, the WSL’s all-professional status should help England’s cause. Much may hinge on Jodie Taylor reprising her Euro 2017 golden boot-winning form.What about Scotland? Shelley Kerr’s side should, at worst, progress to the knockout stages as one of the best third-place finishers. The team have improved considerably since they were thrashed 6-0 by England at Euro 2017. Arsenal’s gifted midfielder Kim Little is the undoubted star and cannot wait to face England in their opening game in Nice on 9 June.Any dark horses? Sweden, Canada and Australia. It will be intriguing to see how Australia – and their star player Sam Kerr – do in the wake of Alen Stajcic’s sacking as coach and replacement with Ante Milicic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

But the driving force behind these albums showed flashes of iconoclastic brilliance even on the group’s most accessible, commercially successful early works.At first, Mark Hollis and his Talk Talk bandmates – bassist Paul Webb, drummer Lee Harris and keyboardist Simon Brenner – employed subtle subversion. On Talk Talk’s 1982 full-length debut, the sophisti-pop totem The Party’s Over, the band assumed the role of new wave tastemakers indebted to Japan and Roxy Music, courtesy of moody bass lines, whimsical keyboards, and compact arrangements. Yet Hollis’s lyrics, which contained allusions to religious imagery, as well as ruminations on betrayal, social upheaval and identity, hinted at far darker and more substantial matters.The stormy, wise title track expressed agony about the negative consequences of ageing and time’s unstoppable march, while the song Talk Talk crisply admonished an unfaithful partner. Hollis’s early band, the Reaction, had already released a gloriously bratty punk version of the latter under the title Talk Talk Talk Talk on the 1977 Beggars Banquet compilation Streets. But their 1982 take on the song adds nuance and depth, swapping out raucous guitars in favour of anxious keyboards, which temper the bitterness of the lyrics: “I’m not that blind to see that you’ve been cheating on me.” For good measure, Talk Talk also features a bridge driven by glassy, mellifluous piano and teeth-chattering drums: conveying uncertainty and anguish, both elements amplify the song’s turbulent emotions.Despite obvious major differences – Talk Talk had no guitarist circa The Party’s Over – the band was often compared to Duran Duran, much to Hollis’s frustration. “People who say that obviously haven’t listened to us properly,” he told Smash Hits in 1982. “Duran Duran’s overall sound is just bass drum.” (After news of Hollis’s death broke, Simon Le Bon called him “one of music’s great innovators” in a Facebook statement.) Still, the association between the two groups wasn’t out of left field. The bands shared a label and toured together, and Talk Talk’s album was produced by Colin Thurston, who also helmed Duran Duran’s breakthrough, Rio. Plus, the murky synths creeping through Talk Talk’s Have You Heard the News and the pulsating disco-pop single Another Word are reminiscent of Duran Duran, while Webb’s nimble bass lines bubbled up to the surface of Talk Talk’s music much in the same way John Taylor’s did.Hollis’s irritation makes more sense when considering that his actual musical inspirations (and aspirations) were much loftier. In early interviews, he discussed Debussy and Shostakovich in relation to his creative process he frequently cited Otis Redding as a vocal influence (“he combines real power with tenderness,” he told Smash Hits in 1982), and heaped praise on John Coltrane’s arrangements and the songwriting skills of Burt Bacharach. “As for contemporaries, I can’t actually listen to things like the Human League because they’ve been played to death,” Hollis continued. “But I think they’ve made really good ground.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hollis also didn’t necessarily consider Talk Talk to be a new-wave band. “You’ve got a rhythm section to provide the beat, and keyboards to provide the melody, which they can do much better than a guitar,” he told NME in 1982. “In a way, the line-up is closer to a jazz quartet than a rock band.” In a nod to jazz’s penchant for instrumental fluidity, Hollis was also deeply unsentimental about Talk Talk’s musical direction at any given time. “Each album should be a definite move on from the one before it,” he pronounced to Electronic Soundmaker \u0026amp Computer Music in 1984.As a result, Talk Talk welcomed new collaborators for the 1984 LP It’s My Life with open arms. After the departure of keyboardist Simon Brenner, Hollis and the band recruited guitarist Robbie McIntosh (then of the Pretenders and later a member of Paul McCartney’s band), pianist Phil Ramacon and keyboardist Ian Curnow. More notably, the band struck up a partnership with Tim Friese-Greene, whose songwriting and production contributions steered Talk Talk toward a fuller, more organic take on contemporary synth-pop. This emboldened Hollis to affect a sophisticated croon that exuded more emotional range – as on the sleek title track, a desperate treatise about being resigned to a doomed relationship that topped the US dance charts and ended up as Talk Talk’s only American Top 40 hit.Yet although It’s My Life sounded of its time, with its funky bass hiccups, manipulated synthesisers and jagged guitar streaks, the album also pushed against contemporary limitations. Such a Shame starts with an extended instrumental intro marked by the sound of trumpeting elephants, sampled by the band themselves after-hours at a local zoo overlapping vocals orbit Dum Dum Girl, creating a disorienting stereo effect and muted trumpet adds shadows to the brooding, sparse ballad Renee. The lyrics are existential and fatalistic, if enigmatic, enhancing the vibe.While 1986’s The Colour of Spring is often cited as Talk Talk’s sonic pivot, It’s My Life more obviously presaged and enabled Hollis’s future atmospheric explorations. Most notably, the album’s international success gave Hollis the financial means to pursue a more unorthodox sonic direction. “In terms of the first two albums and the live field, synths are simply an economic measure,” he told Home and Recording Studio. “Beyond that, I absolutely hate synthesisers. To me the only good thing about them was the fact that they gave you large areas of sound to work with: apart from that they’re really bad – horrible.”Today, Talk Talk’s later work receives much more praise and attention a 2012 tribute, Spirit of Talk Talk, largely shied away from the band’s first two albums. (One notable exception is No Doubt’s keyboard-drenched 2003 cover of It’s My Life, a massive international hit that amplified the original song’s seething melancholy and vocal drama.) Yet The Party’s Over and It’s My Life deserve a more prominent place in conversation about Talk Talk’s greatness. In hindsight, these albums reveal clearly that Hollis was playing a musical long game from the very start of his career, driven by a steadfast creative vision rooted in unwavering self-confidence and relentless forward motion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a560dffd9e5f30818eceea0960fac955c3bdebaf/0_121_5105_3062/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433dec13629644f11199c1906e5a06e3","title":"hard brexit tories a party within a party","story":"’s Dan Sabbagh and Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan explore whether the European Research Group is as influential as ever - or has it overplayed its hand on Brexit?

And meanwhile, he will keep pressing home Labour’s alternative Brexit plan.Ever the canny political operator, McDonnell shares Corbyn’s Euroscepticism, but has been keen to ensure the party’s isions over Brexit do not endanger the bigger project of securing the most leftwing Labour government since 1945.So at various tense moments in the past year or so, it has been McDonnell who has leaned towards a referendum in public, in the hope of calming simmering rebellions.It was McDonnell, together with Keir Starmer, who was deputed to talk to the backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson about their planned amendment calling for a confirmatory referendum on May’s deal, if it is agreed. And he has simultaneously been pressing Corbyn and his close advisors on toughening up their response to antisemitism.The shadow Brexit secretary is, with good reason, seen as the primary voice in Corbyn’s top team who advocates for a softer Brexit, and also for a second referendum.His private views on the issue are clearly some way from those of Corbyn, but during his two-plus years in the role Starmer has maintained the difficult balancing act of staying sufficiently on-message to be publicly loyal while trying to nudge the party position closer to embracing the possibility of a second referendum.His position has been boosted by Corbyn’s decision to finally back a second referendum, and Starmer was quickly on the airwaves to insist such a ballot must have remain as an option.A distinct group from the smaller band of openly pro-leave Labour MPs, such as Kate Hoey and John Mann. They argue that advocating a second referendum could badly damage the party’s chances in leave-backing former industrial areas.This group, which includes the Don Valley MP Caroline Flint and Stoke MPs Gareth Snell and Ruth Smeeth, has been courted by the Conservatives as possible backers of May’s Brexit deal, if given assurances over areas such as workers’ rights.In Tuesday’s Brexit debate in the Commons, Flint hit out at Labour’s embrace of a new referendum, saying the decision to leave “has been made by the British people”. Snell said he “will not, shall not and cannot vote for a second referendum, regardless of how much lipstick is put on it”.Another mini-tribe on the Labour benches are notably more remain-minded, but still dislike the idea of a second referendum.One of the more vocal of these is Stephen Kinnock, the Aberavon MP who backs a Norway-style soft departure, but has spoken out strongly against a new vote.After the meeting of Labour MPs on Monday where the decision was announced to opt for a second referendum, Stephen Kinnock said he had “deep reservations”.“I think it would be deeply isive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/905507211e237325ebc7fa8e37f65d00b05695df/0_0_5238_3144/master/5238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=291cdeaa9c1f2b17424fab77e738ca6e","title":"economy could shrink by 9 percent under no deal brexit government says","story":"Latest no-deal notice forecasts Northern Ireland to be hit hard and food prices likely to riseIn an official document only published after repeated demands by the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the government also revealed it was behind on contingency planning for a third of “critical projects” in relation to business and trade.The document was published just hours after Theresa May was forced to promise two key votes, allowing MPs the option to reject no deal and to potentially delay Brexit for a short period, following pressure from remain-minded cabinet ministers.The prime minister set out a timetable that includes a vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March if that fails, a vote the following day to support no deal, and if that also fails, a vote on 14 March on extending article 50.The delay is likely to further agitate the Tory party’s Eurosceptics, with Brexiter ministers including Andrea Leadsom and Liz Truss expressing their frustration over the issue in cabinet on Tuesday morning.Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, May did not specify the length of any delay, saying only that she would prefer it to be the shortest possible. An extension beyond the end of June would involve the UK taking part in the European parliament elections.Cabinet ministers are keen for May to use any delay to try to force a cross-party consensus.The no-deal notice said customs checks alone could cost businesses £13bn a year and that it was impossible to predict the impact of new tariffs. It said this was partly because the government’s communications to businesses and iniduals about the need to prepare for no deal had not been effective.It said small- to medium-sized businesses were not making basic preparations despite government advice to do so. Only 40,000 of 240,000 businesses that had no experience of customs or tariffs had registered for an economic operator registration and identification number.The government said that while it might wave hauliers through British ports, “they would be stopped if taking goods into France without the right paperwork”. This amounts to the most robust rebuttal yet of Brexiter claims that there would be no delays because the British would be taking a loose approach to checks and controls.Evidence suggested the public had not been heeding no-deal warnings either, with no “noticeable behaviour change” witnessed on a “significant scale” over the need to renew passports, and get international driving permits and green cards for insurance for driving in the EU, it said.“This would be compounded by the challenges of even modest reductions in flow at the border.”It added: “Overall, the cumulative impact from a no-deal scenario is expected to be more severe in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, and to last for longer.”This was because of expected disruption in the “closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland. There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure.”It said fewer than one in 10 items would be affected by delays on the channel crossings but, because of the timing of a potential no-deal Brexit, supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables could be hit hardest.“In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario,” it said.The government revealed there were significant delays to critical projects being undertaken in preparation for no deal.The document confirmed that the Treasury had made more than £4bn available for no-deal planning, £2bn of which was allocated in December to support preparations for the 2019-20 financial year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a478b2ccc35b6598ae1f16c80bdcde037bfb6cbb/0_143_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=274009e5351ac2774d8855a73a469ed6","title":"independent group targets labour with move for second referendum","story":"Amendment demands that the government starts preparing for new public vote on BrexitThe Independent Group (TIG) has tabled an amendment in the Commons demanding that the government starts preparing for a second EU referendum, in an attempt to recapture the initiative on Brexit a day after Labour promised to support moves for a public vote next month.The amendment from the 11-strong group of MPs has the support of the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru and is aimed at provoking a fresh split in Labour by wooing MPs who want the party to support a new vote immediately.Chris Leslie, who defected from Labour last week, called on his former party for support. “If the Labour leadership support this amendment, we could make real progress on a people’s vote. Now is the time to put the national interest first. Parliament must act now.”In reality, Labour’s leadership is unlikely to support TIG’s amendment because Jeremy Corbyn wants to continue pursuing his own Brexit plan, starting by putting it to a vote in the Commons on Wednesday.The Labour leader is likely to seek a fresh meeting with Theresa May and will press her to offer civil service support to work his party’s proposals into a coherent plan. Under Labour’s proposals, the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit and aim for a close relationship with the single market.TIG leaders hope that some Labour MPs who have been pressing for a second referendum could yet back their amendment, but one Labour MP who is close to the People’s Vote campaign was sceptical that they would. “Most of us will ignore it, I suspect,” the source said.In any event, the TIG amendment would have to be selected by John Bercow, the Speaker, to be voted on. It is not certain it will be picked for debate, though the support of Westminster’s third largest party, the SNP, significantly boosts its chances.If selected it would be the first time that a motion calling for a second referendum has been debated by MPs, but there is no prospect of it passing the Commons because of the lack of Labour backing.On Monday, Corbyn told a private meeting of his party’s MPs that the Labour leadership would support a second referendum on May’s Brexit deal if Labour could not get a majority behind its own Brexit plan in the coming days.He repeated the pledge in public, promising that a “confirmatory public vote” would be held if May’s Brexit deal were to pass through parliament next month, despite complaints about the new policy in the shadow cabinet.Corbyn told MPs: “We cannot risk our country’s industry and people’s livelihoods, so if it somehow passes in some form at a later stage, we believe there must be a confirmatory public vote to see if people feel that that is what they voted for.”Labour has been careful not to spell out exactly what a “confirmatory public vote” would entail. Corbyn is understood to be believe the party must give leave voters a “credible proposal” that they could vote for in a referendum.That would not be satisfied by a revised version of May’s deal, even if it had won the support of parliament. But one MP questioned if such a plan made sense. “So, what, we’d back a referendum to oppose our own deal if we managed to get it through parliament?”Labour sources said there had been a vocal backlash against the decision at a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, with some dissent that it had not been discussed and agreed to at a full meeting of the party body.John Mann, a backbencher and Brexit supporter, criticised the party’s “absurd” shift to support a second referendum. “Voters won’t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg. It didn’t end very well for him on tuition fees.”Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said he was “well aware of different views across my own party”. Party sources concerned about a second referendum said at least two dozen MPs would vote against or defy the whip in a Commons vote.Separately, Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, postponed an event for Labour MPs and peers in the party’s “social democratic tradition” that had been due to take place on Tuesday night in Westminster.It had been billed by some supporters as a chance to rally support in the party against Corbyn’s leadership, but other Labour MPs who might be considered supportive of Watson said any attempt to form a separate grouping to threaten the leader would be unpopular with them.Friends of Watson said the meeting, open to all backbenchers, would be held in the next couple of weeks instead. “It’ll be a discussion about how to ensure pluralism within the party, how to get the voice of that tradition heard and also positive policy work about future facing issues,” one ally said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf511bb34c1ca75f48efa45cdcb02a50de18f6a/72_101_1189_713/master/1189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6d8b47f252085743f71e1875749530b","title":"tory mps tell theresa may to face down brexit hardliners","story":"PM offers extension vote as she’s urged to face down Eurosceptic wing of partyCabinet ministers have told Theresa May she must use any delay to Brexit to face down the Eurosceptic wing of the party and forge a consensus in parliament, as the prime minister finally conceded to offer a vote on extending article 50.May reluctantly promised MPs they would have the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit next month and also offered a vote to extend article 50 in an attempt to stave off the threat of dozens of resignations from her frontbench.In an earlier stormy cabinet meeting, where May announced her plan, the  understands the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, both said any extension of the Brexit talks must be used “to find a new coalition in parliament”.The comments, which are likely to further irritate Tory Eurosceptics, strongly suggest an extension is most likely to result in the softening of May’s proposed deal in order to bring Labour MPs on board.In her statement to the Commons on Tuesday, May said she planned to hold the next meaningful vote on her Brexit deal by 12 March. If it was defeated again, it would be followed by a vote on 13 March on leaving with no deal and, if this was rejected, a vote on 14 March for an extension to article 50.At the cabinet meeting, Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, was among those most angered by the decision to offer a vote on an extension and suggested some cabinet ministers had undermined the prime minister. Treasury secretary Liz Truss called the trio “kamikaze” ministers, according to several sources.Rudd, along with the justice secretary, David Gauke, the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Scotland secretary, David Mundell, warned the prime minister in private last week that she must rule out a no-deal Brexit or risk dozens of ministerial resignations.Clark, Rudd and Gauke then wrote in the Daily Mail that Brexit should be delayed if a deal was not passed by mid-March. While Hammond did not sign up to the public statements from his ministerial colleagues threatening to defy Tory whips and back the Cooper-Letwin amendment, allies insisted the chancellor “does his lobbying inside the tent”.Even the party’s chair and May loyalist, Brandon Lewis, said ministers should be cautious about the framing of no deal, pointing out the option was supported by many Tory members. Rudd told Lewis, however, that the cabinet “needed to be straight with the British people”.“This is a bitter pill to swallow,” one cabinet source said. “But ultimately we felt like we had been left with no other option. There has been a private back-and-forth. Should we just let people resign? But that causes its own party problems, too.”The promise to vote on a Brexit delay is likely to avert a serious ministerial rebellion. Dozens had been privately threatening to back an amendment on Wednesday to the government’s latest Brexit motion, which would have paved the way for legislation to extend article 50 beyond the 29 March deadline.The amendment had been tabled by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper and the Tories Nick Boles and Sir Oliver Letwin, but the latter pair said they believed their concerns had now been appeased by the prime minister’s pledge to hold the three votes in mid-March.The cross-party coalition led by Cooper still tabled three amendments to the government’s motion, but was likely to push only one of them to a vote. It sets out the promises made by May on Tuesday in a form that MPs can vote for, giving them added reassurance that neither the prime minister nor other cabinet ministers will go back on those promises.Cooper said the amendment would “pin down and confirm the commitment made by the prime minister today” to hold the series of votes.The coalition was awaiting further reassurances from ministers on Wednesday, including from the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay. If it sensed any backsliding, it could still push for a vote on the two other amendments.May’s spokesman said no decisions had been made on whether the government would support an extension and the prime minister would focus instead on securing a deal MPs could support.Cabinet sources suggested any decision on whipping MPs to vote a certain way would only be made once the meaningful vote had been lost. “Why would we take a decision on whipping before it is absolutely necessary?” one cabinet source said. “You are only going to inflame people on either side.”Despite the apparent win for the soft Brexiters in cabinet, government officials remain anxious that a no-deal Brexit may simply be delayed by a couple of months, with a second extension highly unlikely. “You can probably only pull that cord once,” a Whitehall source said.After a meeting of the Brexit hardliner European Research Group, MPs said they still held out hope that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, could deliver a suitable compromise on the Irish border backstop to allow MPs to back May’s deal.The group’s chair, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the vote “doesn’t change anything enormously … it remains the position that we hope that the prime minister will be able to secure changes we will be able to accept”.He said the group recognised that there was unlikely to be the parliamentary numbers to leave with no deal. “There is no enthusiasm for backing the deal as it is,” he said. “If the Irish backstop could be removed or fundamentally altered, then that would be a different kettle of fish.”Cox arrived in Brussels on Tuesday for talks with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, where he is expected to pressfor legal guarantees that the backstop remains a last resort and temporary option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec39f75b5b0799f8862d2a6c39d898d43b287c8e/0_218_3367_2021/master/3367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ce46467d4fc4d74200f11e861e1a11f","title":"nfl replay rules change saints rams nfc championship game","story":"John Mara hears the cries to change the NFL’s replay system. He doesn’t think it has the votes. After the New York Giants owner emerged from the competition committee’s annual meeting in Indianapolis, Mara told a handful of reporters he doesn’t anticipate significant changes coming to the system, which returned to the league in 1999.“I just don’t sense a lot of support to use replay to call penalties. I don’t sense a lot of support for the expansion of it, either,” Mara said on Tuesday. “We’re early on, so that might change, but that’s my sense of where we are right now. I’m not saying it won’t change.”Fans and many media members have vociferously expressed displeasure with the system since a blown call late in the NFC championship game officials missed a blatant pass interference penalty and a helmet-first hit by the Rams’ Nickell Robey-Coleman deep in Los Angeles territory. The non-calls helped Los Angeles force overtime and eventually win the game to reach the Super Bowl. Mara knows all about that, too. And he also recognizes what repercussions can result from major alterations. “I think you get into a lot of areas there, that there are a lot of unintended consequences, and I just don’t think there is a lot of sentiment for going in that direction,” Mara said. “We had a group of officials in there and I don’t think there was a lot of support from them about sending it upstairs or sending it to New York.”Any rule change requires a 24-vote threshold to pass. Right now, committee members continue to listen to those involved. On Tuesday, it was the game officials. Later this week, it will be the coaches and general managers. At Phoenix, in March, the owners will weigh in and they are the ones with the power to alter the rules. But no formal proposal or recommendation is on the table.

There’s no better time to get into getting rid of stuff.After she emptied our house of all ​that she wanted, I emptied it a second time, of everything that we had grown to want together. I embraced the spartan wisdom of Marie Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up – the self-help manual de rigueur for people who want to want less. Like a barren arctic island basking in my daily hour of sunlight, I proudly embraced an aesthetic of Scandinavian noir-chic, telling anyone within earshot that the drab palette and multiple timber-veneer Arkelstorp side tables were the trappings of a new and more mature me, a me that was as comfortable owning six oversized beige floor lamps and playing at underwear origami as I was being alone.A brutalist of the inner world, Kondo imagines a life made better for being purposeful in its scantness – a message that does not bode well for the abode of one married to their clutter, but I latch on to her philosophy hook, line and sinker. I fold each of my socks, throw away projects that sit half finished, and appraise the emotional bond I share with my cutlery. I begin to feel like maybe it’s actually working. Minimalism feels like a scam until you’re in on it, and isn’t that what scams are all about now?But for all the physical detritus in our orbit, what exists on our computers is vaster and more vague a digital footprint compressed deep. There isn’t a guidebook for emotional digital minimalism. No one tells you how to hold a file in your hand, to embrace a 100KB photograph, to evaluate whether a 10-year text-message history “sparks joy”.It’s been estimated that the trillions of electrons that make up the entire internet weigh about 50 grams, around half the weight of a pack of cards. But what about the emotional weight of keeping terabytes of photographs you took of someone while you loved them? What was the feeling of deleting them? More than anything, I felt the need to find out.We all curate ourselves on the internet, whether you’re an aspiring influencer, KonMari-ing your Twitter followers, or demanding the “right to be forgotten”. But we are increasingly sold the unassailable notion that behind the scenes no such maintenance is required. The cloud is infinite, a fluffy Sunday-school afterlife for our digital debris. Google promises me more space than I could once even fathom, Dropbox will allocate me huge tracts of land on their digital acreage, and Apple pinky-swears that every blurry photo of a dog, cloud or my pink, bared arse will remain safe forever, as long as I cough up to keep their labyrinthine server compound spinning.I begin a pilgrimage. Every photo ever taken, every file saved – my digital history up for appraisal. Years of work and pleasure have become a formless sweater, taking months to unravel, each day finding myself tugging ever tighter in the cold. What at the start is a careful evaluation, trying to consider each file as I had my teaspoons and shower gel, grows increasingly fast and unfeeling. In one marathon session, equipment tests and engagement parties alike flick past in seconds, as I pick out the smattering of photos deemed worthy, before transferring the rest into a growing folder of refuse.I tell all my friends about this journey, and their responses vary wildly. Some find my task Sisyphean but fascinating. Others do not understand, and openly revel in the automaticity of the cloud. Not making decisions, they say, is how they find the time to make other, more important decisions. Mostly they tell me that they wouldn’t have the time, with the kind of look that betrays their concern that I do.One friend tells me of how once, in the days before Facebook, she lost a hard drive containing the entire photographic history of her and an ex how it felt like a cleaving, a blade cutting clean through tender flesh. This sort of thing could never happen nowadays, she muses, and I think of all that data I have no control over. Somewhere out there, pinging off a distant cloud, is the first time I met you, the first time I blurted out, “I love you”, the first time you saw my tits. Somewhere too is the last thing you ever said to me, preserved until the end of time, or until the ad revenue runs dry.I realise too, as the months drag on, that this process is framing and changing how I interact with the content that I create and curate now. Meals are prepared and eaten unphotographed. Conversations carry on with no one sneaking their phones for posterity. I watch sunsets fade into darkness until the night chill sends me indoors, my phone unthinkingly left atop one of my five Arkelstorps. My memory has never been good, but I make more room in my head for moments that feel significant, and the moments I do share with people are more valuable in turn.One day I realise there are no more files to sort through, no more junk data, and all that’s left is one big folder full of all those split-second decisions. I’m back at the beginning, trying to quantify what this means, what this feels like. The boxes have slowly emptied out of the rental we once shared, the last of her self-help books ready to take on a new life outside of this ghost house, and yet this folder lingers, like it’s waiting for me to commit. Then, on a whim, it’s time. There is no more use in deliberating, and I move to delete it.I pause, cursor hovered over the trash as though I’m holding these 50,000-odd photographs cupped in my hands. It is finally tangible. It feels like this deserves some kind of ritual, or a moment of peace. I wait to experience anything in this moment, but there’s nothing there, so I just let go.

The insult “it’s a bit local radio” has long been used in national newsrooms to damn a story thought niche or weak.This perceived lack of relevance and glamour is one of the causes of the sharp decline in area-targeted commercial networks, a decline that digital technology has made still worse. When stations served a defined frequency, the boundaries could be enforced.But LBC – originally a London service – has transmitted nationally since 2014. Global’s decision to transmit mainly nationwide products from London will extend this geographical homogenisation.The reasonable defence of commercial networks will be that, given a dying advertising market, they simply cannot compete with an organisation – the BBC – which runs 40 local stations in England and is subsidised with about £150m of licence fee money.But even the BBC has become less locally focused, with more coverage shared between stations.

I am very proud of what has been accomplished,” he said on Twitter.But the opposition People’s Democratic party (PDP) rejected the result and threatened to take legal action, saying that the ruling All Progressives’ Congress had manipulated the vote.Babatunde Fashola, a minister and the campaign director for election monitoring, told the Associated Press that they were preparing for the president to give his acceptance speech and celebrate. Dozens of supporters began dancing outside party headquarters in Abuja.He said Atiku, who is known by his first name, should accept his loss gracefully and provide evidence to back up claims that the ruling party manipulated the results of Saturday’s vote.The election was delayed at the last minute by a week and, since it was held, 47 people have been killed, according to the monitoring organisation the Situation Room.Reports of vote-buying, multiple failures with the card readers supposed to accredit voters and extremist attacks in the north east marred the election. Many polling stations opened late and, in some, voting continued on Sunday.Shortly before the election, Buhari suspended the chief justice Walter Onnoghen, who heads the supreme court and would have ruled on any dispute over the results. The president’s move was widely criticised as a “calculated attempt to gain some electoral advantage” in the case of a legal challenge.Adewunmi Emoruwa of The Election Network said the election fell short of expectations. “The numbers alone are indicting. We have already witnessed a record number of cancelled votes – more than double the numbers from the previous poll – and which is only a reflection of the widespread irregularities across every part of the country. We all observed as thugs had a field day unleashing terror on demographically profiled voters, which led to the suppressed turnout that has been recorded.”Buhari and Atiku are both northern Muslims in their 70s who have long been in politics. Buhari is seen by many as a strict, inflexible but personally incorruptible figure, while many hoped Atiku, a wealthy businessman and former vice-president, would enact policies to help boost Nigeria’s struggling economy.Buhari’s popularity dropped over the course of his term, because of his perceived inability to deal fairly with government corruption – he was accused of largely targeting his opponents for prosecutions – and his failure to deal with the many threats facing Nigerians. The north-east region is especially dangerous, because Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province still wield considerable might.It would be unusual for a presidential election to be won by a candidate not backed by a powerful cabal of former generals that includes former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Ibrahim Babangida.Buhari narrowly won Lagos, where only 1.1 million of an estimated 20 million residents voted, as well as the pivotal state of Kano, despite the fact that its powerful ex-governor Rabiu Kwankwaso switched from Buhari’s APC to the PDP last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09c505cbe606ada96cbb9abe54d6b0d571f37f0/0_99_3436_2062/master/3436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edf503326eab0930a89f5fc848879d1b","title":"un investigates conduct myanmar rohingya","story":"Exclusive: Inquiry follows claims it ignored warning signs before alleged Rohingya genocideThe UN has launched an inquiry into its conduct in Myanmar over the past decade, where it has been accused of ignoring warning signs of escalating violence prior to an alleged genocide of the Rohingya minority.UN sources have confirmed to the  that the initially hesitant UN secretary general, António Guterres, decided to proceed with the investigation after a “build-up in pressure” within the organisation.It will be headed by Gert Rosenthal, a former foreign minister and Guatemalan permanent representative to the UN, who is thought to have begun overseeing meetings in the role.“This review is not directed at any particular inidual or agency, but rather at how the United Nations as an institution works on the ground and possible lessons learned for the future,” said Stanislav Saling, a spokesperson for the UN in Myanmar, adding that Rosenthal had no plans to travel to Myanmar for his investigations.A senior UN official in New York, who asked not to be identified, said Rosenthal was chosen because “he’s considered to be a very serious and sober expert on UN workings. He knows the house from many different perspectives and is known to be someone who will speak his mind.”There have been multiple calls for a full inquiry into UN operations in Myanmar in recent years, which were described as “glaringly dysfunctional” in a memo written months before the military-led crackdown on the Rohingya in Rakhine state in August 2017.The violence, described by the UN as ethnic cleansing and possible genocide, included the killing of thousands of people, women and children raped, villages razed and forced more than 700,000 to flee over the border to Bangladesh. Marzuki Darusman, the chair of the UN fact-finding Mission on Myanmar, said late last year there was an “ongoing genocide” in Rakhine.Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: “It’s good that the UN is planning to engage in some serious soul-searching to understand what went wrong with their handling of the Myanmar crisis.“Quite clearly, they failed to see and warn the world about what was clear to us and many others long before August 2017 – that the Burmese military was looking for an opportunity to launch a massive ethnic cleansing operation to get rid of the Rohingya.”Criticism of the UN’s response has focused on allegations against Renata Lok-Dessallien, a former resident coordinator of Myanmar, who was accused of downplaying concerns about worsening abuses against the Rohingya discouraging public statements critical of the NLD government, led by the de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi prioritising development strategies at the expense of human rights and even suppressing internal reports that she did not like. The UN has denied most of these claims.However, several UN figures and diplomats said the emphasis on Lok-Dessallien was misplaced, and that the UN failings were a reflection of much bigger issues within the UN system and the diplomatic community in Myanmar as a whole. In 2017 the UN described Lok-Dessallien “as a tireless advocate for human rights”.The recent UN fact-finding mission to Myanmar, which concluded that the country’s military generals should be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity for their actions against the Rohingya and other minorities, also called for a review into UN conduct in Myanmar, echoing a recommendation made months earlier by Yanghee Lee, UN special rapporteur for human rights to the country.“The review needs to be independent from the UN and made available publicly when finished,” Lee told the .Indeed, there are concerns that the inquiry will be purposefully limited in its scope and impact and is not clear if the final report will be made public.According to insiders, there is a wariness within the upper levels of the organisation that amid a climate of increasing hostility towards the UN by governments such as the US, a more wide-ranging inquiry report could sow ision and damage the organisation’s reputation and ability to continue its peacemaking and humanitarian work. The source in New York said moves to initiate the review were stalled by internal tensions.After a hiatus following the controversy around her leadership in Myanmar, Lok-Dessallien is widely expected to be appointed UN resident coordinator for India. She is likely to take up the post before the completion of the Myanmar inquiry, leading to further doubts over the chances it will prompt any inidual accountability.Sources within the UN system said officials at the the organisation’s headquarters in New York did not want a repeat of the damning and internally controversial 2012 Petrie report, authored by the former UN assistant secretary general Charles Petrie.It concluded that during the endgame of the Sri Lankan civil war, where tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed, there had been a “systemic failure” by UN agencies on the ground to speak out for and protect civilians.Iniduals and agencies singled out for criticism in the review objected strongly to how their actions were characterised, leading to rifts inside the world body over how to follow up to the investigation.“It’s hard not to say: ‘Here we go again’,” Robertson said. “There were supposed to be lessons learned after the fiasco in Sri Lanka in 2009 but apparently there weren’t.”The review headed by Rosenthal will use Sri Lanka as a reference point against which to judge what lessons have not been learned within the UN system, the  has been told.Comparisons between Sri Lanka and Myanmar were made in a confidential report commissioned by the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights in Myanmar in 2015.“The situation bears a striking resemblance to the humanitarian community’s systematic failure in the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka, during which hundreds of thousands of Tamils were held against their will in internment camps that were fully paid for and serviced by international humanitarian institutions,” the 2015 report says.Allegations of UN dysfunction in Myanmar have continued since Lok-Dessallien’s departure in 2017. The fact-finding mission report, which was released last August, noted that some UN entities in Myanmar had not cooperated with the investigation.“Things are not as dysfunctional as they were,” said a UN insider based in Geneva, who asked to remain unnamed. “But the fundamental problems and deep isions in opinion, response and strategy remain unresolved. Hopefully the Rosenthal review might be the vehicle that enables them to be addressed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19989621ec75b2fb42e22076b90755d6f3bd4fb/0_270_6409_3846/master/6409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7719b1baf17570b6e0fe6b009620da","title":"how creating a sense of community can help your business thrive","story":"At a time when customer needs are changing rapidly, small businesses must adapt to stay relevant. Many are adopting a community ethos to gain the edge while giving something backAnimator Joanna Susskind opened Glasgow-based design studio Toad’s Caravan in 2010. While running a weekly drawing club on the side, she met dozens of creative freelance workers who were looking for somewhere to work other than their kitchen table. Seeing both a business and social opportunity, Susskind opened up Toad’s Caravan’s office space as a not-for-profit co-working place.Within a few months it was full, with Susskind attributing the project’s success to its collaborative ethos, in which members often share projects, building mini, one-off collectives to tackle larger projects they might not be able to handle alone. “The studio is a great place for connecting with like-minded professionals within our community. It provides a solid base for me to work from, but it runs almost like a cooperative,” she says. “We keep the membership fees low and flexible, so it appeals to everyone.”No matter the sector, businesses that engage with their community are able to build strong relationships with the people in their local area and a reputation for being a business that cares. For example, successful postmasters – the people who run Post Offices – offer a vibrant retail business that builds relationships with and provides a range of services to sole traders and small firms.“Research has shown that a Post Office has a positive impact in the local area, and the postmaster is central to that,” says Amanda Jones, retail director at Post Office. “The most successful ones partner their commercial expertise with a strong sense of social purpose, by fully integrating into their local community and actively engaging with the people. This empowers our postmasters to really understand the communities they serve and ensure their retail offering meets their customers’ everyday and changing needs. I know one postmaster who runs bingo evenings in his local community, and another who, every year, invites someone who he knows would otherwise be alone, to share Christmas dinner with his family.”In 2017, Sean Hudson became postmaster at West Boldon Post Office, a village midway between Sunderland and Newcastle. He and his wife, Katie Hudson, had lived in the village for 20 years and recognised that the Post Office shop could become a hub for the community.Sean, originally a lawyer by profession, says: “The small village communities in that part of Yorkshire were exactly how we remembered them from years ago. We thought it would be great if our own Post Office could go back to being the heart of this village, as it was when we first came here.”In truth, Sean had been growing tired of the law, so he reduced his partnership when the Post Office came on the market and, with Katie, set out to make it the centre of the community once again.The village population is small but erse – a mix of young and old, and people from different career and social backgrounds. This shaped the Hudsons’ strategy to build a business that would appeal to them all. Through social media and Facebook, they have raised their business profile and engaged with the local community in an online space that complements their physical retail presence.Sean says: “We knew that a social media presence was important and also that there were people who don’t use social media, but had family members and carers who do. That has been a very strong link for us. We are already seeing good growth in the retail side, and customers have started to return to the Post Office counter.”One of their community-focused services is “ring and bring”. “If we stock it and you ring us, we’ll bring it to you at no extra cost,” says Sean. “It’s a bit like ‘click and collect’ but more personal. For tech-savvy people, click and collect is an easy concept, but for a lot of people it isn’t. Ring and bring has become very popular with many of our older, less mobile retail customers.”And unlike typical supermarket home delivery services, there’s more to it than simply running into the customer’s home with the groceries and running out. “We always spend a few minutes chatting with them to find out how they are,” he says.The couple are active in many aspects of community life, including helping to set up a volunteer library service following the closure of the local library, and they are members of the residents’ association.Sean describes his role as a challenge and a complete change that is both daunting and exhilarating. He says: “If someone had told me I’d be happier working seven days a week in my current role, than working five days a week in my old job, I wouldn’t have believed them, but it is actually true.”As well as that innate ability to show empathy and engage with people of all ages and all social backgrounds, anyone looking to start a company with a strong community culture also needs a flair for business.Jones says: “They need to develop a retail offering that is relevant to their audience. They must be able to think creatively and, above all, be adaptable.” This goes for postmasters, too. “Like all retail businesses, Post Office has to innovate to maintain its relevance to changing customer needs, so our postmasters must keep pace with evolving digital services and put forward their own ideas on new propositions and ways of working to further improve customer service and experience. That comes with really engaging with, knowing and understanding your local community.”If you’re a community minded entrepreneur, please visit runapostoffice for more information."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807303.1551205277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cost of 2 7km dublin cycle path jumps to 20m due to redesign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA redesign of the scheme plus the construction of a link through Fairview Park, and the requirement to fit in with the Bus Connects  corridor from Clongriffin to the city centre, has resulted in the inflated cost. Photograph Nick BradshawThe cost of installing a new 2.7km “Dutch-style” cycle path from Fairview to Amiens Street in Dublin’s north inner city has almost tripled to €20 million, according to Dublin City Council documents.Councillors in October 2017 approved plans for the segregated cycle route which will connect the city centre with the Dublin Bay cycle path that runs along the coast to from Clontarf to Sutton.The route, which would start at the Alfie Byrne Road north of Fairview Park and continue on each side of the road past the Talbot Street junction on Amiens Street, had at that time, been expected to cost €7 million.However, documents issued by the council this week for the construction of the route have set the cost of the project at €20 million.A redesign of the scheme since it was approved by councillors, the construction of a link through Fairview Park, and the requirement to fit in with the Bus Connects core bus corridor route from Clongriffin to the city centre, has resulted in the inflated cost .The cycle route was first proposed six years ago as a two-way track running on the east side of the road only. However, in 2015, the council’s traffic department said this would not be feasible and instead, it drew up plans for paths on both sides of the road.Felling of 50 treesThe new plans published two years ago, involved the felling of 50 trees in Fairview Park, some of which are more than 100 years old. More than 15,000 people signed an online petition seeking the retention of the trees, some of which were planted in 1908 by nationalist and unionist communities as part of international Arbour Day celebrations.The council subsequently amended its plans to save 42 of the trees, this required the removal of part of the inbound traffic lane running in front of Fairview Park.On approving the scheme councillors ordered further design work be undertaken to achieve better segregation between cyclists, buses, and general traffic, and improved safety for pedestrians.Bus corridorsTo accommodate the enhanced bus corridors, each bus stop will have a “passenger island” with a segregated lane for cyclists to travel behind the stop. Road junctions will be designed in the Dutch style where cyclists and pedestrians are separated from and given priority from traffic.The cycle paths will be two-metres wide and protected by kerbs, and in some places separated from the roadway by trees or parked cars. The project will include the development of a link through Fairview Park along the river Tolka, between North Strand Road and Alfie Byrne Road.The work, which will include the upgrade and reconfiguration of signalised junctions, the installation of toucan crossings, CCTV and lighting, landscaping and utility ersion works, is due to start this year and take two years to complete."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807451.1551213016!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"breath test pregnant women to see if they smoke study suggests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPregnant women who hide their smoking habit miss out on vital monitoring of their pregnancy and end up having more problems as a result, according to the study of women attending the Coombe hospital in Dublin. File photograph: Getty ImagesPregnant women should be breath-tested during antenatal visits to check whether they are smoking, a new Irish study suggests.Women who hide their smoking habit miss out on vital monitoring of their pregnancy and end up having more problems as a result, according to the study of women attending the Coombe hospital in Dublin.It found a substantial number of women with high carbon monoxide levels – an indicator of smoking – had not declared their tobacco use.An increased level of breath carbon monoxide (BCO) was associated with lower birth weight of babies and an increased risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, results showed.The authors, from the Coombe and University College Dublin, said this finding strengthens the case for universal BCO screening at the first antenatal visit. A high reading should result in referral of the woman to smoking cessation services and close monitoring of the baby, they say.Likening the test to the alcohol breathalyser used by the Garda, co-author Prof Michael Turner of UCD’s centre for human reproduction said it was “quick, painless and costs less than a cigarette”.Adverse eventsWomen with high BCO levels had babies that were smaller as well as an almost two-fold rate of having two or more adverse pregnancy events, the study found.Of the 234 women whose data was analysed, 43 per cent said they had never smoked, 40 per cent reported they were ex-smokers and 17 per cent reported currently smoking to midwives.In addition to those who said they smoked, analysis of questionnaires and breath tests showed another 10 per cent had high BCO readings.“Although a proportion of women categorised as ‘non-disclosers’ may be ‘false-positive’, the results of this study indicate that non-disclosers have poor pregnancy outcomes compared with verified non-smokers in early pregnancy,” the study says.These “non-disclosers” tended to be better educated than those who admitted smoking, according to Prof Turner. “They know it’s something they shouldn’t be doing but are reluctant to disclose. Yet they may have a baby whose growth is restricted and risk an adverse outcome.”Women who fail to disclose their smoking do not get the level of monitoring during pregnancy they actually require, the study, published in the European Journal of Obstetrics \u0026amp Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, points out."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Donegal man Brendan McLaughlin (51) underwent transplant in 1992Refurbishment of draughty and mouldy flats cancelled after councillors\u0026rsquo voteGlenveagh claims strict design standards for apartments could be relaxed for older peopleChild and Family Agency must be more transparent, Pat Rabbitte will tell committeePaul Quinn defends decision not to flag concerns to Simon Harris and Pascal DonohueFairview to Amiens Street route originally expected to cost \u0026euro7mUK government document says crashing out of EU could result in business failure in NISix fire engines and water tanker deal with blaze at Northwood Carrington complexMays says if MPs reject deal, they can vote on no deal and on extending article 50Women who hide habit miss out on vital monitoring and have more issues, study showsPAC says sites such as Poolbeg and Player Wills left too long in undeveloped limboVictim seriously injured in Drogheda retail park when shots were fired into carFamily seek answers as to how Ms Hawe and her three sons were murdered by Alan HaweLaw Reform Commission details report on regulatory powers and corporate offencesConcerns were raised over a male teacher\u0026rsquos relationship with a former studentDemonstrators demand pension increases that were stripped almost 10 years agoVaradkar dismisses claims FG more concerned about elections than transportIreland must speak out against Saudi treatment of female prisoners, say activistsThe claims are fully denied by Maria Byrne"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807328.1551219406!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nama criticised for unacceptable housing delays on key sites","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNama sold the debt secured on the former John Player cigarette factory on the South Circular Road  to US property investor Hines in a refinancing deal. Photograph: Alan Betsonhighly critical of Nama over what confidential documents say are “unacceptable” delays to the delivery of housing on key sites it controls, including the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.The documents, drawn up as part of PAC’s work programme argue that the sites have languished in development limbo. They state that the committee is “of the view that delays to the development of sites, such as Poolbeg and Player Wills, for housing are unacceptable”. The committee, alongside the comptroller and auditor general, is one of two bodies responsible for oversight of Nama. PAC, according to the document, will recommend that Nama “prioritises engagement with the local authorities, and other stakeholders, in order to ensure that all obstacles are removed to allow for development of these sites”. Nama last year sold the debt secured on the first of these sites – the former John Player cigarette factory on the South Circular Road – to US property investor Hines in a refinancing deal, and no longer has control of it after being in control of it for a decade. Expanded brief Nama was given an expanded brief in 2014 to facilitate the delivery of residential units amid the emerging housing crisis. It has directly funded the provision of 8,000 units since then, and provided sites for a further 2,500. The committee will also criticise the oversight of Nama’s conflict-of-interest system, designed to prevent assets being sold by Nama from being purchased by people who owe money to the agency, or other “associated debtors”.Nama requires those purchasing assets to sign a declaration that they have no connection to the assets being purchased which would contravene the relevant section of the Nama Act, section 172. However, PAC is set to strongly criticise Nama for a perceived failure to verify that the forms are accurately completed.“The lack of systematic and routine verification of section 172 declarations was unacceptable,” according to the committee discussion document, which recommends that Nama put in place a system to verify the declarations it receives.Non-acceptance of offers The discussion document, drawn up to inform PAC’s conclusions on a range of topics on which it held hearings last year, also makes recommendations about the oversight of the €2.5 million budget used to fund the President’s office – the so-called President’s Establishment.The document states PAC’s view is that it is “unacceptable” the internal audit committee overseeing this budget did not meet prior to 2018, and adds that a report of the audit committee should be published annually."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807474.1551214758!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"impact of no deal brexit would be more severe in the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe 15-page document  details the “negative effects” of a no-deal exit for the UK as a whole, from border issues to increases in food prices, EU tariffs and a general economic slowdown. Photograph: ReutersToby MelvilleThe UK government has for the first time conceded that businesses in the North might not have enough time to prepare for a no-deal Brexit which could result in “business failure or relocation to Ireland”.The latest briefing document from the UK’s Department for Exiting the European Union also highlights that the “cumulative impact” of a no-deal scenario would “be more severe and last longer” in Northern Ireland than Britain, chiefly, it claims, because of the land border with the EU and the current political stalemate in the North.The 15-page document sets out the UK government’s latest assessment of the implications for business and international trade if the UK were to crash out of the EU in March. It details the “negative effects” of a no-deal exit for the UK as a whole from border issues to increases in food prices, EU tariffs and a general economic slowdown.The briefing document also specifically addresses how businesses in the North would be impacted.“In a no-deal scenario there is an expectation of disruption to closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland.“There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure, andor relocation to Ireland with knock-on consequences for the Northern Ireland economy and unemployment,” it states.DisruptionIt also contains a stark warning about the immediate outlook for SMEs – which account for 75 per cent of all private sector jobs – and Northern Ireland’s agrifood sector, which the UK Government acknowledges is located in predominately border and rural areas in the event of a no-deal scenario.“It is particularly vulnerable given its reliance on cross-border supply chains in the production stage and in finished products,” the document states.It also confirms that the government intends to “shortly publish further details on its immediate, temporary, arrangements for trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland in a no-deal scenario”.The UK Government’s latest official Brexit communication also reiterates its commitment to avoiding “a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in any scenario” but it stresses that the British government “would need to work urgently with the Irish Government and the EU to find any sustainable longer-term solution”.Aside from the immediate impact on the North’s economy and business community, a no-deal Brexit would also, according to the UK Government’s latest assessment, cause “disruption” for the single electricity market (SEM), cross-border cooperation on areas such as crime and security, and create the potential for “community tensions to be heightened”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe The Government is more concerned with Fine Gael electoral prospects than with creating a high quality public transport system, Labour leader Brendan Howlin claimed in the Dáil amid ongoing concerns over the Link and BusConnects projects in Dublin.But Taoiseach Leo Varadkar retorted that Ireland is not the Soviet Union or a dictatorship and does not “run roughshod” over the concerns of communities about transport projects.Mr Howlin raised the issue in the Dáil on Tuesday when he expressed concern that the Government seemed to be abandoning the plan for the southside section of the Link rail line in Dublin due to Government unwillingness to endure a lengthy disruption to the Luas Green line.And Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that the Taoiseach had to agree that “whatever solution we pick we will not abandon the southside”. He was worried because the Taoiseach was talking about a metro to the city centre. If press reports accurately reflected the Government’s thinking then “it has abandoned the southside”, he said.It was reported last week that in a major change to plans published last year, the Link line, that will for the first time connect Dublin Airport to the city centre by rail, will still run from Swords to the city, but is likely to stop north of Ranelagh at Charlemont. The change, which will be announced next month when the National Transport Authority (NTA) is due to publish a revised route for the line, means that the  will not continue on to Sandyford. Mr Howlin said that 120 years after Glasgow got its first subway Ireland is “still talking about building Dublin’s first metro line”.‘Dictators’The Wexford TD noted too the ongoing public consultation process about the BusConnects plan to rethink the entire bus system for the greater Dublin area but he said Minister for Transport Shane Ross appeared to have handed power to unelected officials and was not concerned in that case about the anxiety of communities.Mr Howlin said he had been told Fine Gael TD Colm Brophy told a public meeting that he lacked confidence in BusConnects and that Minister of State Catherine Byrne at the same meeting had called the National Transport Authority “dictators” over proposals to change routes through Terenure. The Labour leader said “there seems to be more focus on the electoral prospects of Fine Gael TDs than in providing the vision of a high quality public transport system”.And he called on the Taoiseach to guarantee the plan for Dublin’s public transport had been future-proofed for an expanding city.Mr Varadkar said his Dublin West constituency was a commuter constituency and he was very well aware of the impact of congestion.The Government aims to cut commuting times and the National Transport Authority had detailed plans up to 2030 for the greater Dublin area while the Government had the Project Ireland 2040 initiative.They had to “get on with those plans and implement them” and he hit out at opposition calls for the Project Ireland plan to be suspended and reviewed.They were very committed to the plan to overhaul bus services, “notwithstanding the disruption it will cause to some”, he said.Mr Varadkar said there is consultation with the public on BusConnects and Link and the genuine concerns of communities should not be dismissed. “We’re not a dictatorship, this isn’t the Soviet Union and it’s not the 19th Century in Glasgow,” he said.“We don’t just run roughshod over people in communities. So the right thing to do is to listen to people’s concerns, take into account what communities have to say, amend the plans as appropriate and then go ahead and get them done.” Both Mr Howlin and Mr Ryan called for a debate on the plans. The Green party leader said that “something we could agree to do is to stop scoring petty political points on serious matters of national public policy”.Mr Varadkar said he was “agnostic” about a debate and was not sure it would be “particularly productive”. He suggested that the transport committee would be the best place to debate the issues and to call in experts and agencies to help a “more meaningful” engagement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807236.1551202767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"recruitment and resources for tusla very challenging","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTusla chairman Pat Rabbitte: “The shortage of social workers leaves the agency vulnerable to criticism where non-compliance with best practice is sometimes established.” Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThere are legacy issues and cultural changes that must be confronted within Tusla, according to its new chairman Pat Rabbitte. The former Labour Party leader is due to tell an Oireachtas committee resources are “finite” and the recruitment of professional staff, in particular social workers, is “very challenging”. Mr Rabbitte will also say Tusla needs to be more transparent and there is no reason why the agency should “fear greater openness”. Mr Rabbitte is due before the joint Oireachtas committee on children and youth affairs on Wednesday morning to discuss his appointment and his strategic priorities for his term of office. He will tell the committee deficiencies in the agency have been highlighted in recent years and it is “undeniable” challenges continue to exist. “It is also undeniable that there is a transformation under way in the priority that public policy now attaches to caring for vulnerable children and in supporting families who need assistance as compared to even more recent history,” he will say. “As regards the quality of service and consistency of practice, it is unavoidable that there are legacy issues and cultural changes that must be confronted.”Mr Rabbitte is also due to say additional resources over the past couple of years are “very welcome” but that “there will never be sufficient resources to meet the challenges”. ‘Vulnerable to criticism’“In respect of the core business, the shortage of social workers leaves the agency vulnerable to criticism where non-compliance with best practice is sometimes established,” he will say. Mr Rabbitte is also expected to tell the committee “considerable progress” has been made since Tusla’s establishment in 2014 and there has been “little enough attention” given to the “very positive narrative” it has to tell. “Tusla has come through a difficult time over the past 18 months or so. In my view the agency is stronger for it provided that we can show that we have learned the lessons,” he will add. “The challenge of caring for vulnerable children and families will never attain perfection. However, an enormous amount of thought and work has gone into bedding down the agency and in evolving best practice.” Mr Justice Peter Charleton criticised Tusla over its handling of an incorrect sexual abuse complaint made against Sgt Maurice McCabe in his final report at the end of the Disclosures Tribunal last year. Mr Rabbitte’s appointment was confirmed by the Cabinet at its last meeting before Christmas. Mr Rabbitte, who has served as a public representative for 30 years, was appointed by Minister for Children Katherine Zappone following a selection process and began his new role on January 1st. He served as minister for communications, energy and natural resources from 2011 to 2014, leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2007, and minister of state for commerce, science and technology from 1994 to 1997.

Photograph: Getty ImagesIndia claimed its fighter aircraft successfully launched air strikes at dawn on Tuesday against a militant training camp inside Pakistan, considerably escalating tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours.It was the first such cross-border air attack by India since the two sides fought the third of their four wars in 1971 since independence in 1947.The attack near the hill town of Balakot, some 50km from the disputed Kashmir border, led to the two sides placing their militaries on “high alert” along their 3,320km border.Late in the evening the two armies were locked in exchanging mortar and small arms fire along the line of control (LoC) in Kashmir, which ides the state between India and Pakistan – both of which claim it in its entirety.Pakistan said it would respond at a time and place of its choosing – with a military spokesman alluding to its nuclear arsenal. The spokesman said a command and control authority meeting, which monitors the employment of nuclear weapons, had been convened for Wednesday. “You all know what that means,” he said.Official Indian sources said the attack by 10-12 French Mirage 2000 fighters followed the February 14th suicide car bomb attack that killed some 44 paramilitaries in Indian-administered Kashmir, for which the Pakistan-based Islamist Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group claimed responsibility.India also blamed the Pakistan military and its Inter Services Intelligence Directorate for supporting the JeM and for planning the attack on the Indian paramilitaries, for which prime minister Narendra Modi vowed punitive action against Islamabad.Indian foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters that the “pre-emptive air strike” across the LoC was launched against Pakistan following credible intelligence that the JeM was planning another suicide terror attack in the country.He claimed that in the intelligence-led operation, India struck the biggest JeM camp in Balakot located in thick forest on a hilltop, eliminating a “very large number of terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and jihadis who were being trained for suicide action”.‘Effective response’Pakistani military confirmed the Indian air force intrusion, but claimed it had successfully thwarted it by scrambling its own fighters.“Indian aircraft intruded from Muzaffarabad sector,” Pakistani military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor tweeted, referring to the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. He said the “timely and effective response from the Pakistan Air Force led to the Indian aircraft releasing their payload in haste while escaping”. No casualties or damage were reported, he added.Mr Gokhale termed the air strikes a “non-military pre-emptive action” on the grounds that it specifically targeted militant camps and not civilian areas or military cantonments. Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said Delhi’s fight was against terror and not Pakistan.As well as the attack on its paramilitaries earlier this month, India blames the JeM for the strikes on its parliament in 2001 that led to the two sides mobilising their armies for more than 10 months. The Islamist group was also blamed for assaulting an army camp in Kashmir in 2016 in which 20 soldiers died.Following that incident, in September 2016 the Indian army carried out strikes against suspected militant camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to prevent armed terrorists militants crossing the LoC into India, but these were largely ineffective.Military sources said the Mirage 2000H aircraft, which were escorted by one airborne early warning and control (AEW\u0026ampC) aircraft and an Ilyushin-78 mid-air tanker, employed 1,000kg of precision-guided munitions (PGMs) in their strike.The incident follows recent warnings to India by Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan against initiating any “military adventurism”.Retaliation“It easy to start a war, but difficult to control it,” Mr Khan said in response to Mr Modi declaring that India would inflict a “jaw breaking” response from Islamabad for the paramilitary killings. “We will not think of retaliating. We will retaliate,” Mr Khan stated.The air strike, which took some 10 days of planning by the Indian airforce and other security officials, is expected to boost Mr Modi’s image in India’s upcoming elections, scheduled to be completed before the end of May, provided there is no Pakistani riposte. At an election rally on Tuesday afternoon Mr Modi declared that India was in “safe hands” and that the day of the air strikes would be “immortalised”.“The attack is bound to show up Modi as a decisive leader who will not compromise with India’s national security,” said military analyst Vijay Kapur, a retired lieutenant general. It would stand Mr Modi in good stead politically, he added.India’s opposition parties supported the airforce action, but largely ignored Mr Modi’s role in ordering the attackIndia immediately undertook a diplomatic initiative to justify the air strikes, with Mr Gokhale meeting with ambassadors of several countries in Delhi.India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence over Kashmir.And in 1999, soon after both became nuclear weapon states, their armies clashed in Kashmir’s Himalayan Kargil region for 11 weeks resulting in 1,200 soldiers dying.

Britain is the fattest nation in Western Europe, with rates of obesity rising even faster than those in the United States.Two in three adults are overweight or obese.Experts said many cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed by healthy eating, being more active, and losing weight if overweight.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Millions of Type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented if we help people understand their risk and how to reduce it. Even though the older people get the more likely they are to have Type 2 diabetes, it is never too early to know your risk so that you can make changes to prevent or delay it.”The charity is urging those aged 40 or over to have a free NHS health check offered by GPs.It also said their own Know Your Risk online tool could help people to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Mr Agnew said: “The signs of Type 2 diabetes are often not obvious, that’s why spotting them early can be life-changing. Early diagnosis means that fewer people will experience diabetes-related complications such as sight loss, amputation, kidney failure, stroke and heart disease, because they could seek support to manage their condition effectively as soon as possible.“We urge people over 40 to get an NHS Health Check and we advise everyone to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.”Experts said symptoms of diabetes - which include going to the toilet a lot, being really thirsty, feeling more tired than usual and losing weight without trying -  can be easy to miss especially in the early stages.The condition can go undetected for many years, with one in three cases not diagnosed until they have developed complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.Under NHS plans, 5,000 people will be put on 800 calorie-a-day liquid diets in a bid to reverse the disease.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said children should be warned in school about the risks of diabetes, with diagnosis now happening at an ever-younger age.He said: “Telling them that they could lose a leg or go blind from the disease if they fail to look after their health might seem extreme but it\u0027s the truth.”Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity said: “The growing obesity epidemic is dangerous for the nation’s overall health and worrying for the NHS, fuelling growing numbers of people with Type 2 diabetes as well as costing taxpayers billions every year.This is exactly why the NHS Long Term Plan sets out radical action to tackle this growing problem by expanding the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme so that 200,000 people every year can benefit and introducing a pilot of very low calorie diets that have been shown to put Type 2 diabetes into remission in a significant proportion of those that already have it, he said.Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “This dramatic increase in the number of people living with Type-2 diabetes is likely to spiral further as obesity rates continue to rise. The good news is that we can do something to halt this epidemic.Strong measures from Government and meaningful action from the food and retail industry could transform our environment into one that encourages healthy options. This is why we need the Government to fully implement measures in its childhood obesity plan including restricting unhealthy food promotions and a 9pm watershed on junk food advertising.”Number of children vaping doubles in five years, new research showsHadrian\u0026#39s Wall archaeologists discover rude graffiti and pictures of Roman quarrymen who built itLip filler advert banned after it suggested procedure was \u0026#39as commonplace\u0026#39 as getting haircutMother of girl whose death was part of alleged \u0026#39cover up\u0026#39 by scientists says surgeons \u0026#39have a lot to account for\u0026#39Venezuela deports US-based anchor Jorge Ramos who showed Nicolas Maduro footage of food scavengers183 passengers stuck on Oregon train for 36 hoursMinisters pledge to tackle \u0026#39trans discrimination\u0026#39 in NHS screening Labour MPs warn party will suffer \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 damage over pledge to back second referendumPrince Harry to open memorial to 31 British victims who died in Tunisia terror attacks, Kensington Palace announces Jeremy Corbyn \u0026#39apologises unreservedly\u0026#39 for breaching rules over undeclared trip to New York Brexit could be delayed by two years now option to extend Article 50 is on the table, Theresa May warnedComment: A delay to Article 50 could mean Britain never breaks free from the EU - and the Brexit dream diesLabour MP criticised after arranging screening of film about anti-Semitism in Parliament Delaying Brexit risks a surge in right-wing extremism, warns Jacob Rees-MoggLabour defends Hizbollah as it says Sajid Javid is trying to boost leadership ambitions by banning terrorist groupHow Brexit delay caused Cabinet tempers to rise with Remainers accused of \u0026#39appalling disloyalty\u0026#39British undergraduates at Oxbridge fall amid concern they are being “squeezed out” by foreign studentsUkraine drops Eurovision entrant in Russia rowIsil fighters could be tried at Nuremberg-style tribunal if UK and other countries won\u0026#39t take themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 26 february 2019","story":"At daybreak on an unseasonably warm February day, tens of thousands of starlings erupt in spectacular swarms from their overnight roost under Aberystwyth pier to fly out to their feeding grounds in the fields and marshes around Aberystwyth in west Wales. Number of children vaping doubles in five years, new research showsHadrian\u0026#39s Wall archaeologists discover rude graffiti and pictures of Roman quarrymen who built itLip filler advert banned after it suggested procedure was \u0026#39as commonplace\u0026#39 as getting haircutMother of girl whose death was part of alleged \u0026#39cover up\u0026#39 by scientists says surgeons \u0026#39have a lot to account for\u0026#39Venezuela deports US-based anchor Jorge Ramos who showed Nicolas Maduro footage of food scavengers183 passengers stuck on Oregon train for 36 hoursMinisters pledge to tackle \u0026#39trans discrimination\u0026#39 in NHS screening Labour MPs warn party will suffer \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 damage over pledge to back second referendumPrince Harry to open memorial to 31 British victims who died in Tunisia terror attacks, Kensington Palace announces Jeremy Corbyn \u0026#39apologises unreservedly\u0026#39 for breaching rules over undeclared trip to New York Brexit could be delayed by two years now option to extend Article 50 is on the table, Theresa May warnedComment: A delay to Article 50 could mean Britain never breaks free from the EU - and the Brexit dream diesLabour MP criticised after arranging screening of film about anti-Semitism in Parliament Delaying Brexit risks a surge in right-wing extremism, warns Jacob Rees-MoggLabour defends Hizbollah as it says Sajid Javid is trying to boost leadership ambitions by banning terrorist groupHow Brexit delay caused Cabinet tempers to rise with Remainers accused of \u0026#39appalling disloyalty\u0026#39British undergraduates at Oxbridge fall amid concern they are being “squeezed out” by foreign studentsUkraine drops Eurovision entrant in Russia rowIsil fighters could be tried at Nuremberg-style tribunal if UK and other countries won\u0026#39t take themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"underwater photographer year 2019 pictures","story":"Underwater Photographer of the Year competition celebrates photography beneath the surface of the ocean, lakes and even swimming pools.Alex Mustard, Chair of the jury.WINNER Marine Conservation and Marine Conservation Photographer of the Year 2019The Caretta caretta turtles spend much of their life in the open ocean.

But we\u0027re going to keep asking questions, he added, walking through Caracas airport.Ramos was detained beneath Miraflores presidential palace late on Monday night, after a televised interview with Mr Maduro took a turn for the worse.Ramos, a household name in Latin America, was 17 minutes into the interview when he showed Mr Maduro footage of young Venezuelan men in Caracas following a bin lorry, rifling through the rubbish as it was thrown into the back and eating the filthy scraps of food they found.“He didn’t like the things we were asking him about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, the torture and the political prisoners,” said Ramos.Soldiers unleash tear gas during trouble at Venezuela border, in picturesHe said he and his team were held for more than two hours, and their equipment confiscated – including their phones and memory cards.“We don’t have anything,” he said. “They confiscated the interviews.”Venezuela’s communications minister did not deny that Ramos was held, but blamed the reporter for staging “a cheap show” which he said was directed by the US state department.He added: “Hundreds of journalists have come through, who have received the decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.”Short detentions and deportations have become common, especially as reporters facing delays for official permissions seek shortcuts to report in Venezuela.This has come into the spotlight over the past month as Mr Maduro faces his biggest political challenge since he replaced Hugo Chavez six years ago, with dozens of countries recognising his rival Juan Guaido as the country\u0027s legitimate leader.Venezuelan children, who attend school on the Colombian side of the border, have been blocked from class after the border between both countries was closed At least seven foreign journalists who flew in to cover the turmoil were briefly detained in January.A group of MEPs were also turned back at the airport, with the Venezuelan government claiming they came to Venezuela with suspicious intent.Mr Guaido was on Tuesday still in Bogota, having left the country ahead of the planned delivery of humanitarian aid on Saturday. It was unclear when, or how, he would return, given that Mr Maduro banned him from entering the country.The aid delivery ended in fiasco as the convoys were blocked, a truck of supplies was burnt, four died and 300 were injured in violent skirmishes between Venezuelan troops and Mr Guaido’s supporters.A Colombian police officer in Cucuta, Colombia, looks across the border at Venezuelan security forces Mr Maduro says that the aid convoy was an excuse for US military intervention.“They are trying to fabricate a crisis to justify political escalation and a military intervention in Venezuela to bring a war to South America,” he said, speaking to ABC news in his first interview with a US network in many years.The extremist Ku Klux Klan government that Donald Trump directs wants a war over oil, and more than just oil.Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela\u0027s foreign minister, was in New York on Tuesday night for a meeting of the UN Security Council on Venezuela. The US wants the Council to vote this week on a draft resolution calling for elections and the delivery of aid, but Russia and China would block such a resolution.Mr Arreaza told the Security Council that the US-led campaign to oust Mr Maduro had failed.That was the last chapter in the coup on Saturday, he said. Read my lips - it failed. Now is the time for us to return to sanity.Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, supported Mr Arreaza and questioned what other countries would have done if confronted with an attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo.Turning to the US, he pointedly noted: One country even wants to build a huge wall on the border of another country to prevent an illegal border crossing.Please review our commenting policyNumber of children vaping doubles in five years, new research showsHadrian\u0026#39s Wall archaeologists discover rude graffiti and pictures of Roman quarrymen who built itLip filler advert banned after it suggested procedure was \u0026#39as commonplace\u0026#39 as getting haircutMother of girl whose death was part of alleged \u0026#39cover up\u0026#39 by scientists says surgeons \u0026#39have a lot to account for\u0026#39183 passengers stuck on Oregon train for 36 hoursMinisters pledge to tackle \u0026#39trans discrimination\u0026#39 in NHS screening Labour MPs warn party will suffer \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 damage over pledge to back second referendumPrince Harry to open memorial to 31 British victims who died in Tunisia terror attacks, Kensington Palace announces Jeremy Corbyn \u0026#39apologises unreservedly\u0026#39 for breaching rules over undeclared trip to New York Brexit could be delayed by two years now option to extend Article 50 is on the table, Theresa May warnedComment: A delay to Article 50 could mean Britain never breaks free from the EU - and the Brexit dream diesLabour MP criticised after arranging screening of film about anti-Semitism in Parliament Delaying Brexit risks a surge in right-wing extremism, warns Jacob Rees-MoggLabour defends Hizbollah as it says Sajid Javid is trying to boost leadership ambitions by banning terrorist groupHow Brexit delay caused Cabinet tempers to rise with Remainers accused of \u0026#39appalling disloyalty\u0026#39British undergraduates at Oxbridge fall amid concern they are being “squeezed out” by foreign studentsUkraine drops Eurovision entrant in Russia rowIsil fighters could be tried at Nuremberg-style tribunal if UK and other countries won\u0026#39t take themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/26/TELEMMGLPICT000189795682_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRno0wBcbj8R7Bar7Q2cKrBKi2sT3vi7ux2-RDZwC4QA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hadrians wall archaeologists discover rude graffiti pictures","story":"Roman quarry inscription, which is thought to be done by a detachment from the Second Legion under the junior officer Agricola, as well as a presumed drawingcartoon of this officerA collection of ‘selfies’ inscribed on an ancient quarry in Cumbria has revealed for the first time the faces of the men who helped build Hadrian’s Wall.Archaeologists discovered the faces - along with a figure of a penis - carved into the face of a long abandoned quarry at Gelt Woods, from which stone to build part of the Roman wall was hewed.The two shallow relief busts of the men were discovered alongside written inscriptions describing the project to supply stone for the 73-mile long defensive wall, which marked the northern frontier of the Roman empire.The new carvings found at Gelt Woods quarry earlier this week also include a shallow relief sculpture of a phallus - a common Roman symbol of good luck, no doubt intended to protect the men undertaking the dangerous task of extracting the rock.Experts will now use digital analysis to examine the inscriptions, whose detail is hidden behind layers of natural growth, in order to glean more information about the building of Hadrian’s Wall.Sunset at Hadrian\u0026#39s Wall in NorthumberlandThe faces are thought to be quarrymen attached to the Second and XX Legions who had been ordered to carry out a major repair programme of the wall in 207AD.Ian Haynes, Professor of Archaeology at Newcastle University said: “Memorialisation was popular in the Roman world and was part of the honouring of ancestors. These men had been working at quite a height on the rock face for a while and probably knew they were about to come down for the final time.“Perhaps they thought ‘why not leave our mark and show we were here?’ They may well have wanted that sense of wanting to be remembered which all humans do. Perhaps they were leaving a piece of themselves there to mark the spot where they had been working at this arduous task for so long.”Roman graffiti has been discovered by experts recording carvings which were made centuries ago by soldiers quarrying stone to repair Hadrian\u0026#39s Wall.The site at Gelt Woods is one of only a handful of Roman quarries in England to feature these kinds of inscriptions and the only one to carry the features of people associated with Hadrian’s Wall, now a World Heritage Site.The information recorded on the rock face is of particular importance because it could reveal the names of the men who worked there and and in some instances their rank and military units. One inscription, EPPIVSM, is thought to represent the name Eppius M.Another reads ‘APRO ET MAXIMO CONSVLIBVS OFICINA MERCATI’ and refers to the Roman consulate of Aper and Maximus, allowing archaeologists to identify the site as having been used for the rebuilding and repair work carried out on the wall in the early third century AD.As part of a project funded by Historic England archaeologists from Newcastle University are gaining access to the rock face using a system of ropes and pulleys to record the inscriptions and carvings before they are lost forever to the elements.This shows the difficult terrain that archaeologists needed to navigate to reach Roman graffiti known as the \u0026#39Written Rock of Gelt\u0026#39. Left by the Roman Army in the remains of a quarry near Hadrian\u0026#39s Wall in 207ADLowering themselves 30 feet down the quarry face, they are using sophisticated digital photography techniques to produce a 3D record of the writings and images which will be studied further, before being made available to the public later this year on an image sharing platform.It is hoped the discovery of the two carved faces, along with a third found earlier during the project, will provide hitherto unknown information about one of the greatest constructions projects of the ancient world.New Roman graffiti has been discovered by experts recording carvings which were made centuries ago by soldiers quarrying stone to repair Hadrian\u0026#39s WallMike Collins, Inspector of Ancient Monuments for Hadrian’s Wall at Historic England, said:These inscriptions at Gelt Forest are probably the most important on the Hadrian’s Wall frontier. They provide insight into the organisation of the vast construction project that Hadrian’s Wall was, as well as some very human and personal touches.”The carvings would have last been visible to the naked eye in the 1980s, before the collapse of a path up to the site.What came to be known as ‘the Written Rock of Gelt’ was originally discovered in the 18th century, but the site is only now being recorded properly after centuries of gradual erosion of the soft sandstone into which the images were carved.The Phallus - which is the Roman symbol of good luck and was also discovered by archaeologistsProfessor Haynes said: “These inscriptions are very vulnerable to further gradual decay.  This is a great opportunity to record them as they are in 2019, using the best modern technology to safeguard the ability to study them into the future.”Please review our commenting policyNumber of children vaping doubles in five years, new research showsLip filler advert banned after it suggested procedure was \u0026#39as commonplace\u0026#39 as getting haircutMother of girl whose death was part of alleged \u0026#39cover up\u0026#39 by scientists says surgeons \u0026#39have a lot to account for\u0026#39Venezuela deports US-based anchor Jorge Ramos who showed Nicolas Maduro footage of food scavengers183 passengers stuck on Oregon train for 36 hoursMinisters pledge to tackle \u0026#39trans discrimination\u0026#39 in NHS screening Labour MPs warn party will suffer \u0026#39catastrophic\u0026#39 damage over pledge to back second referendumPrince Harry to open memorial to 31 British victims who died in Tunisia terror attacks, Kensington Palace announces Jeremy Corbyn \u0026#39apologises unreservedly\u0026#39 for breaching rules over undeclared trip to New York Brexit could be delayed by two years now option to extend Article 50 is on the table, Theresa May warnedComment: A delay to Article 50 could mean Britain never breaks free from the EU -

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

According to AP, Lee made his way to the building’s exit while the film’s producers were delivering their acceptance speeches, but was stopped by staff members.510 Green Book disappoints as Best Picture winThis year’s Academy Awards was a tale of two shocks: one pleasant, one dire. The latter arrived with the announcement that Green Book had beaten out the category’s frontrunner, Roma, to Best Picture. It was a dismal reminder that progress is a slow, tedious process. Had Roma prevailed it would have made history, becoming both the first foreign language film and the first film distributed by Netflix (or any other streaming service) to win Best Picture. - Clarisse Loughrey610 Melissa McCarthy\u0027s costume to present Best Costume Design710 ...and Brian Tyree Henry\u0027s to join her810 Bohemian Rhapsody is ahead of the pack with four winsAlthough Green Book walked away with Best Picture, the film with the most wins of the night was Bohemian Rhapsody.

If, by the way, I forget anybody, I’m going to find you later and give you all a massive snog.” - Clarisse LoughreyBlacKkKlansman director Spike Lee was visibly angry after learning that Green Book had won Best Picture at this year’s Oscars,  saying “the ref made a bad call”. According to AP, Lee made his way to the building’s exit while the film’s producers were delivering their acceptance speeches, but was stopped by staff members.510 Green Book disappoints as Best Picture winThis year’s Academy Awards was a tale of two shocks: one pleasant, one dire. The latter arrived with the announcement that Green Book had beaten out the category’s frontrunner, Roma, to Best Picture. It was a dismal reminder that progress is a slow, tedious process. Had Roma prevailed it would have made history, becoming both the first foreign language film and the first film distributed by Netflix (or any other streaming service) to win Best Picture. - Clarisse Loughrey610 Melissa McCarthy\u0027s costume to present Best Costume Design710 ...and Brian Tyree Henry\u0027s to join her810 Bohemian Rhapsody is ahead of the pack with four winsAlthough Green Book walked away with Best Picture, the film with the most wins of the night was Bohemian Rhapsody. It’s news that will also come as a significant disappointment to many. Alongside three wins in the technical categories – for Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound Editing – Rami Malek also picked up Best Actor for his role as Freddie Mercury. - Clarisse Loughrey910 The Academy takes two steps forward for ersity, one step backFour years on from the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, and two years since the Academy took steps to rectify its predominantly white, male demographic by inviting 774 new members, it’s clear that progress has been made. Regina King won Best Supporting Actress for her role in If Beale Street Could Talk, BlackKklansman director Spike Lee finally won an Oscar after decades of snubs, and Black Panther’s costume designer Ruth Carter, and its production designer Hannah Beachler, both became the first ever African American winners in their categories.  - Alexandra Pollard1010 Richard E Grant wins hearts, even if he doesn\u0027t win awardsNo one has enjoyed awards season more than Richard E Grant. The 62-year-old star of Can You Ever Forgive Me? was, in his own words, “granted temporary membership to the A-list fame club” after the role earned him an Oscar nomination. Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

Sterling was up 0.81 per cent against the dollar at $1.3203 and rose 0.77 per cent against the euro to hit €1.1620. The upward move came after reports Theresa May is planning to delay Brexit, with the\u0026nbspextension of Article 50 put on the table as an option in the House of Commons\u0026nbspon Tuesday. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn made a dramatic U-turn on Monday and said Labour would back a second referendum.Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton FX, said: “The pound’s gains are a result of markets beginning to price in an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period.

Mr Jenkinson received £38m last year in his previous role as managing director.\u0026nbspHousing minister James Brokenshire is said to be “increasingly concerned” about Persimmon’s behaviour, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership.Created with Sketch.Outrageous property deals in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115 The Park Lane townhouse set to become one of the UK\u0027s most expensive student flats at £4,000 a weekA town house situated in Park Lane, one of the most affluent places in London, is about to become the capital’s most expensive student residence.215 London\u0027s most expensive flat goes on sale at Buckingham Palace near Buckingham Palace priced at £150mA luxury flat in London’s historic Admiralty Arch, which overlooks Buckingham Palace, could sell for up to £150 million.315 ‘Little White House’ inside the US embassy complex in London goes on sale for £2.5mA luxury home inside the US embassy complex has gone on sale for £2.5m.415 First London luxury flats to contain their own private art gallery  with prices going from £3.8m up to £7.7mThe first private luxury apartment building in London with its own private art gallery has been unveiled in March.515 Margaret Thatcher\u0027s Belgravia home is up for sale for £30mMargaret Thatcher’s six-floor townhouse in Belgravia is on the market for a cool £30 million.615 Tiny London house that is just 10ft wide goes on market for £800,000A tiny terraced house that measures no more than 10ft wide has gone on the market in south London for a staggering £800,000.

It’s a hilarious, buffoonish pleasure, right down to the sets and costume design, and a breeze to spend 120 minutes with.” Christopher Hooton“Casting Chalamet as Nic was a very clever move. The young actor from Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird has a natural charm and charisma. He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab313 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive. At first, it seems as if this is low-key social realism in the Dardennes or Ken Loach mould, albeit set on the French Riviera. Gradually, though, we realise how stylised and theatrical his approach really is.” Geoffrey Macnab“Director Jon S Baird, whose previous film was scabrous Irvine Welsh adaptation Filth, wrings every last drop of pathos he can from his material. This is very much a case of the tears of the clowns.” Geoffrey Macnab“Vice is bravura storytelling. McKay isn’t only taking us through Cheney’s life and career but is giving us a whistle stop tour through US politics from the Nixon administration almost right to the present day.” Geoffrey Macnab“Playing Lee Israel, McCarthy manages something very special: she makes a character who is odd, obnoxious, difficult and alcoholic seem lovable and even heroic.

In adapting Ryu Murakami’s cult novel, Pesce strikes just the right balance between humour and Grand Guignol-style shock tactics.” Geoffrey MacnabThe best moments here are remarkable.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go. However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

Pay, holiday entitlement and benefits for teachers will remain unchanged.Mr Elliott said: “This is about moving away from a culture that has developed in the teaching profession of over burdening staff with excessively long hours.\u0026nbspThe benefit to the students is that they we will be able to recruit, train and most crucially retain the very best teachers which means better quality of teaching in the classroom.”It comes after experts\u0026nbspwarned this week that there was an urgent need to ensure there were enough teachers amid rising pupil numbers, a shortfall in trainees and more teachers quitting.Last month, the government published its Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy last month to reduce workload and encourage more teachers to stay in the profession.Additional reporting by SWNSWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The idea is to give people back control of their data and end the exploitation and monetisation of people\u0027s private lives by the likes of Facebook and Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHTC describes its Exodus 1 as the first smartphone built for this new internet and it is the brainchild of Phil Chen, the appropriately-titled \u0027decentralized chief officer\u0027 of the Taiwanese firm.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re this far into the information age and there\u0027s barely any conversation about digital property, Chen tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspAll of our private data – from credit history to search data – is handled by third parties. We don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.The way to get the power back, Chen says, is to introduce a paradigm shift to the big data business models of these large tech companies, from the apps we use, to the way we pay.\u0026nbspThese blockchain phones operate on the same underlying technology that supports bitcoin, so it is no surprise that cryptocurrencies form a key role in their operation.At MWC, HTC is also introducing a new range of decentralised apps – or\u0026nbspdApps\u0026nbsp– that do not share or send data back to a centralised company or server. Some apps even allow people to monetise their own data, by selling it for cryptocurrency.Payments can also go the other way, meaning users can make micropayments directly to websites and content creators without the need for transaction fees.\u0026nbspEven the phone\u0027s default browser, Opera, supports\u0026nbspsuch functionality, describing itself as the world\u0027s first crypto-ready browser.We are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo, says Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera.\u0026nbspHTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation.ethereum (HTC)Like other blockchain phones, such as the Sirin\u0026nbspFinney, the HTC Exodus 1 comes with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet that can store private keys for\u0026nbspbitcoin, ether and litecoin\u0026nbspoffline. By not being connected to the internet, this cold-storage wallet protects the funds from hacking, as well as a person\u0027s private data.Until now, the HTC Exodus has only been available to buy in cryptocurrency\u0026nbspbut from March people will be able to purchase it using traditional fiat currency, with the eventual hope that the phone and the decentralised web will make it into the mainstream.I don\u0027t like calling it a blockchain phone because it\u0027s not just for crypto geeks, Chen says.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt\u0027s been 10 years since the birth of bitcoin and blockchain technology but the industry is still very much in its infancy.Interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain has been in decline ever since bitcoin\u0027s dramatic price crash, which saw the cryptocurrency lose more than three quarters of its value in 2018.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Online analytics show Google searches for both terms have been in free-fall during that time, and according to Gartner, the technology entered the so-called \u0027trough of disillusionment\u0027 phase in its 2018\u0026nbspHype Cycle for Emerging Technologies\u0026nbspreport.The leading market research firm says it may be another 10 years before it reaches the \u0027plateau of productivity\u0027 and begins to see widespread adoption.For this to happen, Chen says, it will likely involve the very tech giants that this technology poses a threat to. Their considerable reach means their adoption of such technology would automatically push it into the mainstream. Another scenario would be that continued data breaches propel\u0026nbspthe conversation of digital property into the spotlight.People are becoming more aware of their data and will realise this is part of the solution, he says. This could spread like wildfire. The tech giants may try to quell its spread, but ultimately they may have to choose between fuelling it or getting burnt and left behind.The HTC Exodus 1 and Sirin\u0026nbspFinney\u0026nbspmay be the first, but blockchain technology is already seeping into more mainstream devices. Earlier this month, Samsung announced its flagship Galaxy S10 range of smartphones, which came with a Blockchain Keystore.There are also rumours that Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, which could facilitate payments across its range of messaging apps – from WhatsApp to Messenger. With close to 2 billion users worldwide, such a move could create a currency to rival the dominance of the\u0026nbspUS dollar almost overnight.In a recent interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg explained how blockchain-based authentication could make the social network more secure. But he added: I\u0026nbsphaven\u0027t figured out a way to make this work out.With the technological and financial resources at his disposal, it may just be that Zuckerberg simply hasn\u0027t figured out a way to implement the technology in a way that Facebook can still claim ownership\u0026nbspto it.blockcain smartphones (HTC)The open, decentralised and borderless nature of blockchain\u0026nbspis the reason blockchain remains the only technology vertical not dominated by the incumbents of the industry – it is antithetical to their current business model. The likes of Amazon and Google are leading the way in everything from fintech\u0026nbspto artificial intelligence, as these are all technologies they can control and own.The two largest smartphone makers, Samsung and Huawei, both profit from personal data through their cloud storage businesses. It could therefore fall to Apple to create that spark.Tim Cook keeps talking about privacy but can he take the next step? I\u0027m hopeful and I would be their first cheerleader if they did, Chen says.\u0026nbspThis is a big, giant leap, but we are a David among Goliaths. It will take a giant company to start reversing this tide.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we can do that, then the whole thing will take off and there will be thousands of companies doing creative things.”Blue Origin has already carried out several successful flights of its New Shepard reusable rocket and the company plans to use it to take people into space later this year.Despite similar ambitions by SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, Bezos insisted\u0026nbspat the New York event that it is not a race, stating, “We will fly when we’re ready.”He also stated that his goal for Blue Origin is different to that of Musk, who has consistently said that he wants to send people to live on Mars.Bezos has been reinvesting money he made at Amazon since he started his space exploration company Blue Origin more than a decade ago (Getty)Musk even predicted last year that there is a 70 per cent chance that he would go to Mars himself. Bezos\u0026nbspsaid he had a different long-term vision for humanity, which involves moving heavy industry and energy production into space in order to protect Earth.“My friends who want to move to Mars – I say, ‘do me a favour, go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first, and see if you like it. Because it’s a garden paradise compared to Mars,” Bezos said.“We want to go to space to protect this planet. That’s why the company’s named Blue Origin – it’s the blue planet that’s where we’re from.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief among those innovations is flexible displays, which allow the handsets to bend in the middle and fold over.As the technology has become more mainstream, so have the phones using it – and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week has played host to the announcement of a variety of bendy handsets.\u0026nbspMany of the companies didn\u0027t actually allow people to use the phones, and they are not widely available.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers. Now, the shoes have lost one of their main features and cannot be controlled in the way they are intended.The problems have led to a raft of one star reviews on the Google Play Store, as customers complain the shoes are crashing.Created with Sketch.Best vegan shoes for women Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials? Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials?

These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.App wont pair with left shoe, the top review reads.\u0026nbspPaired with sneakers right after unboxing then completely crashed after last update.Why Nike thinks the future of its stores is an appAnother reviewer wrtes: whenever I try connecting my shoes, it says error try again or it says it\u0027s already connected with another pair of shoes.Most complain that the app has broken on the left shoe specifically, while the right shoe continues to work.The iOS version of the app is still working, suggesting the problem is with the design of the Android tools.The problems appear to have arrived after Nike sent out a firmware update intended to fix problems with the shoes. Downloading and applying that caused the Android app to break.The shoes do have manual controls, meaning that people can lean down and tie them up. But a large part of the functionality is built around the fact\u0026nbspthey can be controlled through the companion app, allowing for easy tightening when needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company sold 7,970 homes under the scheme last year, almost half of all\u0026nbspits sales, and up from 7,682 in 2017.For each of those sales the government provided an interest-free loan to buyers, a move which critics say has\u0026nbspserved to further boost house prices and returns for\u0026nbspshareholders. Persimmon has returned\u0026nbsp£2.2bn\u0026nbspto shareholders in the past seven years.A source close to the housing minister said: “Leasehold, build quality, their leadership seemingly not getting they’re accountable to their customers\u0026nbspare all points that have been raised by the secretary of state privately.”Leasehold homes have come under increasing scrutiny as homeowners have been hit with thousands of pounds in fees to carry out repairs on their own properties.A spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the Ministry of Housing, Communities and\u0026nbspLocal Government said: “We expect all housing developers to deliver good-quality housing, to deliver it on time, and to treat purchasers of newbuild homes fairly.“Last October\u0026nbspwe announced our intention for there to be a new homes ombudsman, and we intend to introduce legislation to require developers of newbuild homes to belong to this body.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

But if parliament rejects that deal, then an extension will be necessary and the wording of that amendable motion will be crucial.”Created with Sketch.How Brexit will affect your travel to Europe Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit“PM statement does what is needed to prevent no deal exit on 29 March and enables MPs to forge cross-party consensus on new way forward if PM’s deal does not succeed on 12 March. No need now for Cooper-Letwin Bill.”Conservative MP Nick Boles, another member behind the push to take no deal off the table, said he was “gratified” the PM had backed down.He added: “This is a victory for parliament. We will lay amendments to her motion this afternoon and seek confirmation of her commitments from ministers during tomorrow’s debate.”The prime minister left no doubt that she does not want a delay and still hopes to obtain assurances from Brussels which will win MPs’ approval for her withdrawal agreement in a fortnight’s time.But Ms May’s official spokesman refused to be drawn on other key aspects of the government’s approach if her deal is rejected –\u0026nbspfor example, would the government whip MPs to support no deal or not in that instance, or would it whip them to support a delay.They did indicate that it is Ms May’s preference to delay Brexit no later than June, if she must do it at all, in order to avoid the UK having to take part in European parliament elections, but they could not rule out MPs forcing a longer setback.Some Conservative Brexiteer backbenchers appeared relaxed over Ms May’s announcement, claiming that even if Brexit is delayed the default position at the end would still be a no-deal Brexit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair\u0026nbspof the European Research Group of Leave-backing Conservative MPs, instead attacked colleagues who had been behind the drive of trying to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum.He said: “My suspicion is that any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit. This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit.”But fellow Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen MP was angry that Remain-backing cabinet ministers had not resigned when they opposed the prime minister’s approach, as Eurosceptics like Boris Johnson and David Davis had.He said: “It appears that Leavers moan and leave the cabinet, but Remainers moan and remain. It’s very selective collective responsibility.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Tomorrow, there will be an amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition setting out the party’s Brexit demands, notably a permanent customs union. That amendment won’t mention a referendum.The Labour Party is no longer in favour of keeping all options on the table, including a public vote:\u0026nbspnow it supports a public vote, which all its leading spokespeople accept means a referendum, with Remain as one of the options. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.There are caveats and cavils. The wording of the statement is that a referendum is “to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit”. That might suggest the policy ceases to apply if parliament finds another way to avoid Brexit. If, for example, the House of Commons votes on 12 and 14 March to reject the prime minister’s revised deal, and to delay Brexit, would Corbyn still be pressing for a referendum?\u0026nbspHas the forward march of Corbynism been halted?Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted on Channel 4 News yesterday that Labour would continue to support a referendum even if Brexit is delayed. But until there is what Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, calls a “credible Leave option” – that is, a Brexit deal approved by parliament – it is hard to see what the choices in a referendum would be.The new Labour policy appears to be that there should be a referendum after parliament has approved a deal.\u0026nbspThe more serious obstacle to a new referendum, however, is that it is not (yet) supported by a majority of MPs – even with Corbyn throwing the weight of the Labour front bench behind it.\u0026nbspBy my calculation the maximum support is currently 288 MPs, which is 31 short of a majority. The problem for advocates of giving the British people the Final Say is that there are more Labour rebels on this subject\u0026nbspwho are opposed to a referendum than there are Conservatives who are in favour.\u0026nbspFinal Say supporters such as Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, insist that there are more Conservatives, including ministers, who would back it when it comes to the crunch. On the other hand, there are probably more Labour MPs who have doubts about a referendum but who have yet to be flushed out.\u0026nbspCynics suggest that Corbyn is not entirely sincere in his support for a referendum that he has held back for so long and is now appearing to back it only to try to head off further Labour defections – and safe in the knowledge that it could not get through the House of Commons.\u0026nbspOn the other hand, however, a referendum must be one of the ways of breaking the deadlock if Brexit is delayed. And it would be hard for Corbyn ever to retreat from the position that he adopted at 5.27pm yesterday.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

This could result in business failure, andor relocation to Ireland with knock-on consequences for the Northern Ireland economy and unemployment.”And food prices\u0026nbspare “likely” to increase in the wake of a no-deal exit, the papers said.Much of the information and analysis contained in the paper, released in response to an amendment tabled by the now-Independent Group MPs Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry, was already in the public domain.But Mr Umunna said it painted “a disastrous picture of the catastrophe which would befall our country if there is a no-deal Brexit”.He continued: “In light of what she knows, it is utterly irresponsible for the prime minister to keep a no-deal Brexit on the table given the extreme damage it will do.“These papers set out how food prices will rise, we may see panic buying, there will be severe disruption at the border, and jobs and livelihoods would immediately be put at risk.“Today she told the House of Commons she is listening, but MPs have passed a motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit and yet she refuses to request an extension of the Article 50 process in order to stop no-deal happening.We’ll tell you what’s true.

They agree a sortie of multiple Indian aircraft crossed the “line of control” into Pakistan-administered Kashmir, although not by much, and fired towards a town called Balakot.They agree\u0026nbspthe operation was conducted in a matter of moments – an incursion of just one-and-a-half minutes in total, according to Indian defence sources – and that Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets in response.And that’s about it. For while India’s foreign secretary issued a statement describing the Tuesday morning air raid as a successful mission to avert an imminent terror attack, Pakistan’s armed forces insisted it did nothing more than scuff up some dirt and knock over a few trees. No infrastructure damaged, and no loss of life.Neither side is yet to prove their point. India may yet, as it did during a similar incident in 2016, produce satellite images which it claims show the destruction. One government minister said the operation had “completely destroyed” the largest training camp belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the militant group behind Kashmir’s deadliest car bombing earlier this month. It’s the sort of damage that before-and-after imagery should easily pick up.Created with Sketch.Fire on the streets as Indians react to the Pulwama bombing attack Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Indian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirPakistan’s foreign ministry said its side of the border was open for domestic and international journalists alike to themselves check for any signs of damage. Indeed, the ministry\u0026nbspsaid it was taking independent military observers to inspect the scene.But where to look? In the confusion after the event, the two sides could not even agree on which Balakot had been targeted – one in Pakistan-administered Kashmir or, and which would be a more serious incursion, one in Pakistan proper. Specifically, in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – prime minister Imran Khan’s home province.Here in India, the government has been preparing both practically and rhetorically for an operation like Tuesday morning’s. Since the 14 February Pulwama bombing, the government\u0026nbsphas collected statements of solidarity and support for action in the face of terror\u0026nbspfrom more than 48 other countries. And in the last few days, security forces in India’s Jammu and Kashmir have pre-emptively rounded up more than 300 suspected separatist agitators.Narendra Modi had promised a “jaw-breaking” response to that car bombing in Pulwama,\u0026nbspcarried out by a young local man but prepared by JeM,\u0026nbspwhich killed 40 paramilitary police officers, and in this context made a substantial retaliatory attack seem inevitable – even justified.In his statement, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said the sortie only hit terrorist assets and thus was not an act of aggression against either the Pakistani military or civilians. He creatively described it as “non-military pre-emptive action”.India raises customs duty on goods from Pakistan to 200 per centIndia says Pakistan had ‘direct hand’ in Kashmir bomb attackIndia warns Pakistan of ‘jaw-breaking reply’ after suicide bomb attackWhat is Kashmir Solidarity Day and how is it observed?Pakistan does not view it that way, though. It has not only denied any state involvement in Pulwama, but demanded India provide evidence for the claim that JeM prepared the attack from Pakistani soil.The country’s own foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said the airstrikes were\u0026nbspa “grave aggression”, and prime minister\u0026nbspImran Khan vowed that “Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing”.At the same time it played down the impact of the airstrikes. Mr Khan said that “once again\u0026nbspthe Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim”, suggesting\u0026nbspthe Indian account was “for domestic consumption” in the runup to imminent elections.He is not the only one pointing out that an escalating conflict with Pakistan plays well for Mr Modi and his nationalist BJP in the polls.A Reuters survey showed a marked uptick in support for Mr Modi in the immediate aftermath of the 14 February attack. He was, after all, swept to power in 2014 at least partly thanks to the image he portrayed of himself as a strong leader.Sure enough, it wasn’t long after news of the airstrikes broke on Tuesday that videos started doing the rounds on social media of jingoistic displays of Indian flag-waving, anti-Pakistan chants and the burning of Pakistan flags. One analyst who did not wish to be named told me he did not believe a surgical strike had been necessary and that it had been “orchestrated for the election”.Another defence expert, Dr Gopalan Balachandran, said the airstrikes were “clearly motivated by the JeM attack in Kashmir”. He said the death toll in Pulwama had been “intolerable” to most Indians, and that Mr Modi “needed to show that he was doing something about it”.Since 14 February, a number of opposition parties have broached the topic of the BJP making political hay out of the Pulwama attack. West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee went as far as accusing the Modi administration of wanting to instil “war hysteria”, leading the BJP’s state president to accuse her of making “baseless allegations to score political brownie points” herself.It would be too soon for anyone to do the same on Tuesday night. Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj emerged from a cross-party security briefing to state that “all parties in one voice praised the security forces and supported the government’s anti-terror operations”.So what next for Pakistan? Mr Khan has called for both houses of the country’s parliament to sit on Wednesday to discuss the situation, and he has also summoned an emergency meeting of the National Command Authority\u0026nbsp– the body that oversees Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.Amid the high-stakes sabre-rattling, Mr Khan has little option but to offer a military retaliation, analysts say.In ordinary circumstances it would need to be “proportionate” – but does that mean destroying a base of 300 Indian paramilitary officers, or a copse of trees? Before the country\u0026nbspcan decide on a response to today’s events, Pakistan will need to settle on – and convince others – of its version of exactly what occurred.We’ll tell you what’s true.

They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leaderSome were happy to see Mr Zarif’s possible exit. “Good riddance,” tweeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a sentiment echoed by both conservative think tanks in Washington and hardliners in Tehran.“Close the door behind you and never come back, Yankee!” wrote Zahra Tabakhi, a conservative Iranian journalist, in a tweet.Mr Rouhani, in a speech on Tuesday, did not mention the resignation, but praised Mr Zarif, amid reports that he was trying to convince him to stay. \u0026nbspIf our Foreign Ministry is doing something, it is because it is from the people and it represents the people,” said Mr Rouhani.His chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi posted a photograph of the president and Mr Zarif working closely together, and insisted that Mr Rouhani was “completely satisfied” with his foreign minister.Despite Mr Rouhani’s entreaties, Mr Zarif may be holding out for a gesture of support from supreme leader Ali\u0026nbspKhamenei.Mr Zarif’s announcement came just hours after his visible absence during the first public visit of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to Tehran since that country descended into a years-long civil conflict.In his place, seen in meetings with both President Hassan Rouhani and Ayatollah Khamenei, was Qassem Suleimani – the powerful commander of Quds force, the clandestine overseas ision of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).Mr Zarif had apparently been kept in the dark about Assad’s surprise visit, and while there is no sign that the foreign minister opposed Iran’s steadfast support for the Damascus regime, he has been frustrated by being kept out of the loop on significant policy matters.“This was the last straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Maysam Behravesh, a researcher and Iran expert at Lund University in Sweden.“Zarif’s curious and conspicuous absence from Syrian President’s meeting with Khamenei, Rouhani and Soleimani took many off guard,”The slight, documented in state news agency photos and shared on social media, apparently outraged Mr Zarif, who told an Iranian newspaper that after the pictures today, Javad Zarif has no credibility in the world as Iran\u0027s foreign minister.Shortly afterward, he posted his resignation on Instagram: I would like to sincerely apologise for not being able to continue my service and for all my shortcomings during my service.One Western diplomat who works on Iran policy matters said he understands that “the pressure of the IRGC” may have contributed to the resignation.\u0026nbspAs for the JCPOA: “The supreme leader doesn’t seem to want to get out of the deal but to test limits to send a message,” he told\u0026nbspthe Independent.The US-educated Zarif, long a fixture of the moderate factions of Iran’s political elite, had previously served as Tehran’s envoy to the United Nations. He was a key architect of the nuclear deal, forging a partnership with then US Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.While it is unlikely that Ayatollah Khamenei or Mr Rouhani would immediately abandon the deal, it remains unclear whether any successor to Mr Zarif would have the diplomatic skills, personal ties, and strong motivation to maintain it.“There seems to be a fragile collective consensus within Iran’s wider leadership that the handicapped nuclear deal is still worth keeping, but this can change once its most vocal and solid backer is out of the game,” said Mr Behravesh.Being the most public face of an isolated Middle East country seeking to build up trade ties with the West, without scuttling the utopian ideals of a 40-year revolution, was never going to be easy.But Mr Zarif has been facing numerous pressures that have likely made his job especially challenging.Mr Trump’s decision last year to abandon the nuclear deal badly damaged Mr Zarif’s credibility among regime hardliners who opposed any rapprochement with the West. \u0026nbspHe has become a lightning rod of criticism by an often unelected but powerful collection of hard-line stalwarts in the clerical and security establishments, who are skeptical about his outreach to the West.A photo published recently showed Mr Zarif in apparent physical anguish as he sought to convince such lawmakers about the importance of upgrading Iran’s money-laundering rules to bring them in line with international standards as a prerequisite to robust trade with the West.Mr Zarif is also under pressure by Iran’s Western allies, including France, Germany, and UK. Lacking any other interlocutor, European diplomats have been pressing Mr Zarif and his foreign ministry colleagues to scale back deployment of militias and hardware to Syria and Iraq, ease the expansion of its missile programme, and comply with money laundering standards – \u0026nbspall matters over which the foreign ministry has little control.“What has driven Zarif crazy is the Rouhani administration’s handling of some files, in particular Bashar Assad’s visit,” said Adnan Tabatabai, co-founder of the Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient, a Bonn think tank.“It’s a sign of frustration with Rouhani.”In addition to the president’s appeal, a group of 150 Iranian lawmakers on Tuesday were petitioning Mr Rouhani to reject the resignation and for Mr Zarif to stay in his post, according to official news agencies.“I strongly believe Rouhani will try to bring Zarif back,” said Mr Tabatabai. “But this has to be done in a face-saving manner and it is yet to be seen to be done.”Mr Zarif’s departure may ignite a struggle for control of the foreign ministry. Already elements of the clandestine services and the Revolutionary Guard have been accused of using Iran’s diplomatic outposts to carry out potentially violent operations abroad, and to heighten tensions with the West, all of which could intensify.His resignation, if embraced, could also embolden US hardliners who’ve been generally thwarted in their efforts to isolate Iran. Mr Zarif has earned a measure of admiration even from his critics for his passionate and sometimes effective defence of Iran in the international media and at global forums, including at the Munich Security Conference this month.“He was acting as a remarkable brake on the confrontational policies and ambitions of Iranian hardliners,” said Mr Behravesh. “Abroad, he was hampering the Trump administration’s efforts to optimally exercise its ‘maximum pressure’ policy against Iran by calling out its contradictions, perils, and consequences.With Zarif gone, the\u0026nbsphardliners on both sides of the planet will be going on a honeymoon together.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470961972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says corbyn ian austin","story":"His resignation is even more signicant than that of the others, except the Jewish MP Luciana Berger, in that he did not scuttle off to join a second referendum pressure group.He was a Remainer too but, unlike them, intends to keep his election promises to see the result through.Austin is a veteran Labour man, now “ashamed” of Corbyn and his Marxist mates.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fernandina Tortoise was found last month on the remote island of Fernandina in the Galapagos after the species had not been spotted since .News of this historic discovery was first downplayed because it was originally believed she would need a male partner in order to prevent the species from going extinct.Forrest Galante, the biologist and Animal Planet presenter who discovered the reptile, said the female could still save her species because of her ability to store fertile sperm until she needs it.The tortoise, now named Fern, is about  years old and when she gains weight from being in captivity may surprise conservationists by laying eggsshe has the decades-old sperm inside her.Galante told the : “Its incredible, but female tortoises are able to withhold viable sperm within them for decades, then produce offspring without having to mate a second time.“Nobody knows anything about the Fernandina tortoise because it’s the first one ever found, but given the harshness of the environment and the uniqueness of the animal, it’s certainly possible that she is able to hold viable sperm for  years.”They are able to move the sperm through contractions in and out of the storage structures.Some female tortoises can store sperm from more than one male and can then choose, which sperm she wants to fertilise her eggs with.Animals with lower body temperatures can store sperm better because of their reduced metabolic rates.Fern was captured during an expedition funded by US TV channel Animal Planet for the series Extinct or Alive, which Forrest presents.He went to the remote island of Fernandina, about miles from Ecuador’s mainland and has the La Cumbre volcano – one of the most active in the world.Galante and his team from the Galapagos National Park and the US NGO Galapagos Conservancy began the expedition with a -hour boat ride from Santa Cruz, the capital of the Galapagos Islands.Within hours of arriving, Galante found tortoise poo and an active bedding site.Fern was found completely alone and had been surviving on a green patch surrounded by lava flows.Galante said there is no way to tellshe has been alone her whole le orshe lived most of her le with another tortoise.No other male was found with Fern.The only other tortoise of the same breed to be found was male and was found dead at the turn of the century.Galante added now it’s time to find a male suitor to prevent the species from dying out, but she could lay eggs at any moment.He added: “We could mate her with another male from another nearby island, so you would have a tortoise which is very genetically close to the Fernandina tortoise and aesthetically identical.Or she could surprise us by using sperm she’s kept inside her for decades and just start laying eggs. That would be just incredible.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472107626-e1551219962286.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"judge lonely paedos can meet","story":"Barry Cutler, , was jailed in  alongside other members of the now-defunct Paedophile Information Exchange, which promoted sex with minors.A sexual offences prevention order bans him from meeting or communicating with others who have similar convictions.But Cutler, of Beckenham, South London, claims because of his “social phobia disorder” he has no pals who are not perverts.He has now won a legal fight to contact Anthony Zalewski, an ex-PIE member with two child sex convictions.Judge Nicholas Cooke, who agreed at the Old Bailey to amend the order, said the two men had common ­interests unconnected to offending.He said Cutler, jailed for indecent photos, was “a sad figure who lacks insight into the damage done by child pornography”.Peter Saunders, of the ­Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: “It beggars belief.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie.

Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed.”The spokesperson added: “The Home Secretary must now demonstrate that this decision was taken in an objective and impartial way, and driven by clear and new evidence, not by his leadership ambitions.”Home Office aide Racheal Maclean said Labour’s stance was “shocking”. She said: “It’s shocking but not at all surprising that Corbyn fails to stand up to appalling terrorists and anti-semites who beyond any doubt seek the destruction of Israel and their allies.”Labour’s London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday said the ban was “long overdue”.Tory deputy chair James Cleverly last night stormed: “There has long been cross-party cooperation on national security, but Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party continues to reject the values that once united people across the political ide.“His refusal to back our decision to ban the antisemitic terrorist organisation Hizballah is yet another example of why even ex-Labour MPs think he is not fit to lead the Labour Party, let alone the country.”Labour last night said it would not oppose Sajid Javid’s “overall” motion which also called for the proscription of Jamaat Nusrat al Islam Wall Muslimin and Ansaroul Islam.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I just can’t take it anymore. I need her to be gone from here and moved on to somewhere better.”After Emily claimed she had been forced to move out, The Sun Online called in Hull-based exorcist Ralph to help, and stuck around to watch the spooky series of events.Emily moved into her Chelmsford flat seven years ago and, at first, she noticed items were moved around the house.Then she started to feel an icy sensation in her leg when she sat on the sofa, assomeone cold was sitting next to her.But, she claims, the strange activity didn’t become a nuisance until she started sitting in a dferent chair in the evening.“After that she started acting dferently,” she adds. “She upped the ante and one day when I was in the bathroom, where I believe Joyce died, she flushed the toilet over and over again. She now does that a lot.“She’s smashed cups on the kitchen floor and thrown things about. She’s taken ornaments, including the beautul angel wings that hang on the wall which she tried to flush down the toilet.“I had to start going to bed in a hat to stop her from pulling my hair out and hitting my ears. She’s caused pain in my hip and head, and stolen things from my flat never to be seen again.”Emily, a practising Christian, called in local a priest to help by performing an exorcism, but Joyce continued to terrorise her. At her wits end, she move away to the Travelodge only for the spirit to follow.I could feel her presence in the room, she says. It felt like I just couldnt escape her.“Now whatever I have to do to make her go I will do it - I just want her out.“I want her to leave and go onto the next place, wherever that may be. I trust Ralph and will do whatever needs to happen.”While Emily thought she was going to be stuck with the horrible ghost for le, exorcist Ralph had come to assure her that this spirit was far from evil, and wouldn’t be dficult to sort out.Preferring the term negotiator to exorcist, Ralph claims he communicates with spirits in order to perform a soul collection - moving spirits on to whatever lies beyond the grave.He performs exorcisms, a spiritual practice often associated with the Catholic Church, that sees spirits removed from homes, areas and even people by commanding them to move on.“I started seeing spirits and energies when I was a boy, as early as six years old,” Ralph explains. “So I’m very much able to clear energies, ghosts and evil spirits from homes or people.“I’ve worked with people who have contorted like in The Exorcist, dealt with walls caving in due to demons and I’ve been thrown across rooms by powerful evil forces. But that isn’t the case here.”And despite being in demand to deal with exorcisms up and down the country, Ralph normally charges no more than £ for his services, paying for his petrol to and from Hull out of this payment.Ralph explains that Emily’s pesky spirit is low level, known in his profession as a level four, and is more like an annoying child, who may be pulling her hair and smashing items in order to get attention rather than instil fear or pain.Cases like this are common for Ralph - who reveals he turns ice cold when he senses Joyces presence.“The spirit will be as frightened as we are,” Ralph assures. “We just have to give her time and a gentle persuasion - and we all need to just accept she is here and relax to help her on her way.”Standing in the bathroom, Ralph places his hands on the wall and his knuckles start turning white as he says the spirit is getting closer to him.He asks for complete silence while Emily calls Joyce forward.“Joyce, please come forward and meet us,” she confidently asks the spirit, beginning the exorcism. “We want to help you. Come on, don’t hide. Say something, dont be afraid.”Silence - apart from a bird chirping, which in itself seems spooky in the middle of the night, and a slow clunking from the shower.Ralph commands Joyce to move with him to the bedroom.Asking Emily to sit down on the bed, he closes his eyes and waves his hands through the air.He recognises another spirit in the room, Emily’s Irish father, who is apparently overlooking the process.The news is reassuring to Emily, who says she feels safer in his presence.“I call Joyce and her family to step forward,” continues Ralph. “Let all the spirits unite as one energy form, moving her out of the house as one. By the use of higher authority, I ask you to move forward.Emily continues: Im asking you to move forward, Joyce. There will be peace for both of us, we will be happier. This is what I want - and we send our love with you on your way.Ralph points to the hallway with an expression of shock, but there’s no ghost when we all turn around. Instead, he calmly explains that the suffering is finally over for Emily. Joyce is gone.“I could hear her footsteps going out of this room,” Ralph says with a smile as the exorcism concludes. He hands Emily a small vial of holy water, the pair hug and he leaves.Slightly disoriented and still shaking from the experience, a genuine smile appears on Emily’s face for the first time in months - she feels that Joyce’s presence is gone at last.Now sleeping again without her protective hat, and getting her first full nights since her horrying first encounter with the spirit, Emily says she is a testament to Ralph’s work as an exorcist.“When all this started I stopped singing - but now I can sing again,” she says.“I can’t wait to start singing and dancing around my home now that she’s gone. It’s such a relief. Finally I’ve got closure.“Ralph has truly done something amazing - I trusted him fully and I could never thank him enough. I never thought I’d get my le back, but it was all down to the exorcist.”Sadly, a week after the exorcism Emily revealed that Joyce was back.Shes not in the flat but in another part of the building, which I think is the hallway, she told us. And shes very angry.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First Labour announced the party is prepared to back a second EU referendum. Now Theresa May has outlined a formal plan to delay Brexit. There are still a lot of unknowns, and we dont know how itll end - with huge consequences for you and your family. All the while, No Deal Brexit preparations are continuing at a cost of more than poundmillion to hard-pressed British taxpayers. So what exactly has been announced, what does it mean, and what happens next  Heres a basic guide. What has Theresa May announced today   Theresa May outlined a sht in her Brexit plans in a statement to the House of Commons. She unveiled a three-step plan that could lead to delaying Brexit . Those steps are:March : Vote on Theresa Mays Brexit deal. By this date, the government will hold a new meaningful vote on the -page Brexit deal. If it passes, Brexit happens with a deal, almost certainly on March  . If it fails, or theres no vote, move to step . March : Vote on No Deal Brexit. By this date, Theresa May will table a Commons motion asking MPs for their explicit consent to leaving the EU with no deal. If they give consent, we leave with No Deal on March . If they dont give their consent, move to step . March : Vote on delaying Brexit. On this date, MPs will hold a vote on whether to delay the date of Brexit by up to three months - to the end of June.Why has she done it now   The Prime Minister announced the major change in a desperate bid to head off a Tory revolt. Remain-backing ministers had lined up to warn theyd defy the government and vote to delay Brexit, as soon as tomorrow night. That could have forced around  ministers to resign. The Remainer Tories were prepared to back an amendment by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which said MPs should get a vote on delaying Brexittheres no agreement by March . By announcing her own plan , the Prime Minister has taken control of the process. Oliver Letwin announced there is now no need for his Bill to delay Brexit because Mrs Mays statement does what is needed. Is delaying Brexit guaranteed   No. But its now more likely. Technically, we have to get through three votes before Brexit will be delayed. But the odds are on all those votes tipping towards delaying Brexit. Downing Street today insisted the focus and very strong preference remains on getting a revised Brexit deal. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is in talks today with Brussels to revise the Irish backstop - a clause in the -page deal that could extend EU customs rules over the UK. But no big changes are expected, so the deals expected to be voted down - just as it was by a record margin in January. Then theres the vote on No Deal, but the Commons has already shown it has a majority on No Deal Brexit. There are some unknowns of course. We dont know yet how the government will whip its MPs to vote on a delay. Will they be told to back one  Or will ministers have to resignthey do   Theresa Mays Brexit deal was shattered by a record-setting -vote majority in January. Yet, whisper it, there is still a way the deal could pass. Now that shes dangling the prospect of a delay, Brexiteer Tories may feel so boxed in that they have no choice to accept Theresa Mays plan by March . Its not what they want - but it now looks like the only way to ensure Brexit happens on time on March . Of course, those Tories alone wont be enough to pass the deal. Theresa May has a tiny majority and there are plenty of Tory Remainers. But  Labour MPs showed last month theyre prepared to rebel to stop Brexit being delayed. If those forces unite, then technically, the deal could get through.  No. And MPs are furious. Theresa May insisted that even after a delay, the choices we face would remain unchanged. Leave with a deal, leave with no deal, or have no Brexit. Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: This is yet more trickery from the PM. She’s still refusing to take no deal off the table legally or otherwise no matter what Commons says or does. It’s all just her way or the highway.  Yes. Theresa May said today she would seek the shortest possible extension, and not beyond the end of June. That dates been chosen because new MEPs take their seats from July , and the UK is supposed to have no MEPs by then. Yet the motion that gets put before MPs will, crucially, be amendable, No officials said today. That means MPs could force a longer delay on the Prime Minister, and she is committed to legislating for the result. Downing Street did, however, reject reports of a -month delay - saying its not been brought up by EU leaders in talks with the Prime Minister. Does this make a second referendum more likely   A second EU referendum has become slightly *more* likely in recent days, after Labour backed a bid to hold one. But overall, its still looking very unlikey. There arent enough pro-referendum MPs in Parliament to back one, and Theresa May continues to oppose the idea. She said today it would be isive for the country.  We dont know yet. Theresa May repeatedly refused to say how she will vote personally on a No Deal Brexit. And Downing Street officials refused to say how Tory MPs will be whipped on either No Deal, or a delay to Brexit. That means the government has promised these votes but we dont actually know what the governments opinion is on the outcome yet. What about the Spring Statement   Talk about timing! Chancellor Philip Hammond is delivering his Spring Statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday  March . Its expected to start at .pm and last around  minutes. It had been widely thought the Statement would be used to outline plans for No Deal spendingTheresa Mays deal failed. Despite the change, its understood the Spring Statement has not been moved - despite being scheduled for the same date as a vote on whether to agree or prevent a No Deal Brexit. If both are on the same day, the Spring Statement will come first, and the No Deal vote afterwards. However, the No Deal vote could be held first.  The move will deepen the calamitous split in the Tory party. Downing Street claimed there was broad Cabinet agreement for the plan today - but refused to sayit was unanimous. It came after Remain-backing ministers threatened to resign rather than allow a No Deal Brexit. But now that shes compromised, Theresa May has the Brexiteers to deal with. Backbench Tories lined up today, furious at the idea of a delay. My residents don’t want an extension of Article , said Giles Watling. It takes two to tango and it’s time the EU learned to dance. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: My suspicion is that any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit. This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit.

The document warns restrictions in imports across the English Channel, will cause fruit and veg prices to rise, leading to panic buying and shortages. “As of February ,” the document warns, “many businesses in the food supply industry are unprepared for a no deal scenario.” Potential disruption to cross-Channel trade would lead to reduced availability and choice of products, the document stated. It will be a particular problem because the UK is due to leave at the end of March - a time of year when the UK is particularly reliant on the Short Channel Crossings for fresh fruit and vegetables. But food prices are not the only element to be negatively affected.UK citizens could find themselves subject to full Schengen checks when travelling to the EU, with longer waits at the border and exclusion from the use of e-gates for passport checks, the Government document said.   Around , UK companies which trade only with the EU would be caught up in customs processes, with a total administrative burden on business from customs declarations of around pound billion a year. Goods exports would not enjoy the current fully free-flowing border in place at present, with delays expected at the French border for paperwork checks, the document warned. The Governments worst-case planning assumption is that, as a result of French checks and lack of businesses readiness, the flow of goods through the Short Channel Crossingscould be very signicantly reduced for months, it said. The document also warned that the introduction of tarfs and non-tarf barriers to trade in the case of a no-deal Brexit can be expected to have a very severe impact on some UK industries. The EU would introduce tarfs of around % on beef and % on lamb exports and % on motor vehicles. The impact on UK businesses would be compounded by the challenges of even modest reductions in flow at the border, said the document. It was impossible to accurately predict the ability of businesses to adapt, but the risk of no deal is of major concern for the car industry, both because of tarfs and disruption to just-in-time supply chains.

Roger Cazaly, who runs Plume of Feathers in Portscatho, Cornwall with we Helen, gives as good as he gets on the website. The quaint th Century pub near the beach has received more than  “excellent” or “very good” reviews on TripAdvisor, but there are  “terrible” critiques from members of the public. Roger told one diner he hadn’t “cringed this much in a long time” at their post. He also compared one customer to “a small child that can’t have a biscuit, Cornwall Live says. But people on social media have lauded Roger. I think the pub Landlord sounds like a legend, wrote one woman. Another posted: Excellent answers! Well done the landlord... One Facebook user wrote: I want to go just to meet the Landlord. What a legend! I loved his responses.   One diner had previously put on TripAdvisor: Just popped in for some food, was told they were too busy. Said we’d just have some drinks, they basically suggested that go someone . Rude, arrogant. Rogers y reply read: “Now now Kitty, its not nice to call people names. But seeing as youve decided to go on the worldwide web and call me names like a little child who didnt get what she wanted when she demanded it, let’s talk about your visit. “Folks, it was a Saturday evening on the bank holiday weekend of the half term, it was between  and .pm. This is possibly the most premium time food wise in any restaurant or pub, especially in a little Cornish pub in the middle of a holiday destination. We were at full flow, every table taken, tables had been booked weeks in advance, the kitchen is maxed out. “However, Kittyminx,she comes to the bar with her children and says Chips, I want chips for my children. I responded with an apology and said thats fine but there will probably be about a  or  minute wait and probably apologised again. “You seemed stunned by this, so I went onto explain that we were absolutely maxed out and there will be a waityou want to go ahead and order then we had that awful  or  seconds where you just blinked and stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language, so I then said the taverna down the road is open and they do takeaway food as well, which might be a better option at this moment in time . “I actually thought I was being helpful, giving you options, but obviously you didnt see it this way. Someone dared to say no to Kittyminx!   “Now, Kittyminx, when you leave ‘reviews’ like this, it actually says more about you than the venue. Because, generally, we then go into your profile and read your other reviews and have a little chuckle. You use the words Rude and Arrogant with gay abandon dont you  We read about when you complain that the waitress had asked you to stop your children playing on the stairs  times, the poor girl … or when another venue got slagged off because you werent allowed to move the furniture … Kitty, you had probably put [it] in front of a fire escape or something. “Trust me Kittyminx, when it comes to rude and arrogant you might want to look a little closer to home.” Another diner was upset with birthday celebrations at the pub. They wrote: “We had waited all summer to have a meal at the Plume of Feathers ... very popular with tourists, no chance for locals! “We booked for Monday night as it was the actual birthday! Bad mistake! We were squeezed into a passageway! With another table reserved for later making it a very tight squeeze! We had three courses: soup, main, dessert all were warm and the meat was very tough! “Chips were under-cooked and soggy! The waiter was over the top with compliments which appeared to put pressure on us! No extra attention though given to the birthday men! I.e. a candle in their dessert or an extra biscuit! The waiter was told two of the party had birthdays! The bill was expensive to the quality of the meal! “So … tourists you are welcome to the Plume of Feathers we will not be going back! A little attention would have been lovely evenit was to sit in a restaurant with a table laid and flowers present! Then the bill wouldnt have mattered! Very disappointing as we are locals!” But in a y reply, Roger defended the boozer.   He wrote: “ exclamation points!! !! Folks, here we have the very controversial ‘locals’ scenario. This seems to happen in two locations, Cumbria and Cornwall. “When someone says they are a ‘local’, this is not to be confused with a ‘regular’. When someone enters your premises and keeps dropping ‘were locals, dont you know’ into the conversation, generally, theyre not really. “Quite often they will be from outside the county, say, somewhere like Peterborough, and theyve just moved down very recently and immediately want all the trimmings of being a ‘local’. If you dont treat them as such, evenyou have never seen them ever before in your le, they will scuttle off and go on TripAdvisor. If you do, they are full of praise and everything is wonderful. But, we just treat everyone the same. Sorry. “I would say that over % of our customers are ‘real locals and regulars’ so Im not sure what the nasty little jibe about tourists means. “We apologise that we were still busy in November and we had all our tables booked out … bloomin’ locals coming in booking tables! We apologise that the waiter was complimentary towards you, he has been dealt with severely, he wont be doing that again in a hurry, oh no! “Im sorry we didnt make more of a fuss of you for your birthday, but perhaps you were in the wrong place as you call us a restaurant, we are in fact just a little country pub. Perhaps you thought you were in TGI Fridays or Chiquitos where I think the staff are made to sing to you when they find out its your birthday, youll like that. “Please tell me, what did that curry house in Peterborough do so wrong that you had to visit it seven times and slag it off every time. Did they not put candles on your naan bread  You should have told them youre a local!! Hold on, Peterborough  I thought you were a local down here ” ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"  The Plume has four stars out of five with  reviews on Tripadvisor, where it is listed as second out of nine restaurants in Portscatho. Yet, one customer labelled the pub as having the “worst customer service ever!!!” The man wrote: “We visited the Plume of Feathers to meet up with family and friends who were all visiting from up north for a wedding. We were all treated with disdain from the landlady and her staff. “They were rude, unhelpful and made it blatantly obvious that we were not welcome. I dont know why her attitude was as it was, but it really spoiled what should have been a joyous celebration. The beer and average food was way overpriced, the toilet was filthy and stunk of urine and the interior was at best, shabby. She refused to serve any spirits because it was too early. “The top and bottom of this review is this,you visit the Plume and dont buy their way overpriced food, then you not welcome to just have a drink. “In my opinion, not worth a visit, over-priced, overrated and an arrogant landlady who’s had a charisma bypass. Worst customer service, ever.” However, Roger disputed some of these points and accused the diners group of swearing. He said: “Wasnt quite like this was it  You arrived en masse at .am and seemed surprised that we didnt serve alcohol before am. But then at am the drinking commenced. “We didnt refuse to serve spirits at all, becauseyou remember, when the young ladies found out that we didnt sell Blue WKDs in our little Cornish village pub they started drinking gin and bitter lemon. They said this was ‘lush’. So dont tell lies. “Now, you maybe alluding to the fact that we refused to sell shots at .pm. We did think it a little early and unnecessary. The younger lot seemed to agree with us and said things like ‘sound’ and ‘probably best’. But you decided to go on and on about how its the done thing up north.  “Seeing as you had only been drinking Carlsbergup to this point and your behaviour was already deteriorating at a vast rate of knots, we feel we made the right decision on not serving shots at . in the afternoon. Eventually my we had to ask you to stop swearing loudly in the pub as other people were coming in with children. I think its at this point that my we had the ‘charisma bypass’ because you then went into the loud heavy duty swearing. “So then, instead of my we asking, she told you to stop swearing, to which point she even had to get the poor father of the bride to ask you to leave because of your behaviour. “You didnt eat in the pub, so that little jibe about the food is obviously a rather pathetic attempt to make yourself feel better about your behaviour. The toilets were cleaned spotlessly in the morning and the only people that had been in the pub all day was you and your party, so I feelthere was any issues there, you may want to look a little at yourselves. “If you are asked to leave a premises due to your behaviour, just take it on the chin. Dont put sad little ‘reviews’ on websites. It embarrasses yourself and this one has embarrassed the father of the bride … again. I believe he did ask you to remove this post, but I guess you dont have that much respect.” Another reviewer criticised the food: “We took some ‘fresh’ fishes for us and chicken balls and fries for kids. Food was absolutely disgusting, for kids - everything from microwave. Sorry, I cant recommend. Maybe its good place for beer, but, unfortunately not for families with little ones.” After explaining that the fish is delivered fresh twice a day, Roger wrote: “If you cant tell the dference between microwave chipsfrom freshly prepared triple-cooked chips, Im not sure you have the skills to be putting ‘reviews’ on websites. “What are chicken balls  “I was askedI had reserved a table number, I am sitting outside. Sorry , you need to reserve a table. Sat outside with my drink , wondering where I could go. Two couples sat outside were brought food whilst I was having my drink. Nobody said that my table was reserved and could I move.   But Roger replied: “And here, ladies and gentlemen, lies the problem with TripAdvisor. “A lot of people dont quite understand the hospitality trade, andsomething disappoints them, they give it a ‘review’. And they give it a  star. “Sad isnt it  Like a small child that cant have a biscuit.... “Now, Tony M, let me give you a little lesson on the catering industry. Just because you can sit at a table and can see other empty tables does not mean we are not fully booked. “Are you with me  Its about what the kitchen can cope with at any one time, so we stagger the bookings so the kitchen doesnt get overwhelmed. Are you still with me  “Now, sometimes, when the kitchen is flowing awesomely, and someone walks in for a table without having previously booked, we will checkthe kitchen can squeeze them in between the checks they already have on. Sometimes its a yes, sometimes its a yes but they will have to wait half an hour and sometimes its a flat no. “We dont like saying no, Tony, no business likes saying no, treacle. But sometimes instead of making  promises we have to say no. Have we learnt something, blossom  “When it comes to doing a review, giving someone a  when disappointed is being a petulant child. It says everything is bad, bad, bad. Was the service bad, was the beer you drank bad  Do you see what I mean, treacle  You were just disappointed, so thats not a review is it  “Hopefully youve learnt something today, now you go and put your big boy pants on and get out there and do a proper review.

Ken and Barbara Mead,  and , say they have been left penniless and reduced to living on a boat bought for them by their daughter and son-in-law, following their battle over a warehouse they had built in Sutton, Macclesfield.Enforcement officers from Cheshire East Council have begun demolishing the building, saying the couple had breached planning permission by building it to the wrong specications and later living in it. A spokesman said evidence shows that it was always the couple’s intention to live in it. However, the family said it wanted to build the warehouse to rent out to make money and only moved in after becoming fed up with living on a canal boat when the pound, legal dispute ate up their funds. They bought the plot of land in  and, after permission for a bungalow was refused, permission was granted to build a warehouse five years ago.   But Cheshire East Council then said the building was unauthorised as it did not conform to specications, something Ken disputes and he says the particular reasons for it have never been explained. Unable to then rent it out and fed up of staying on the boat, the couple began living in the dormant warehouse in  as it had kitchen and shower facilities. The building did not have permission for residential use and the council took enforcement action - won in court - and demolition work on the warehouse began this week. Ken, a retired builder, said: “We moved to Macclesfield to be near our daughter and young grandchildren, only to find ourselves in a five-year nightmare.   “We have been left penniless and without a home. We had a building and couldn’t do anything with it even though the council signed it off as a warehouse. We have lost everything.” The couple, who have four grandchildren, estimate the costs of building the warehouse, at Bullocks Lane, and fighting the legal battle come to around pound,. Their original boat was sold to help fund their legal costs and their daughter and her husband, Susan and Arron Taylor, sold their home to buy them another to live on. Ken and Barbara, a former nurse, moved out of the warehouse and on to the canal two weeks ago. They have put many of the possessions they have left up for sale. Arron, a managing partner at Tytherington-based training company Optimality, claims the dispute can be traced to a council error.   He says planners originally gave permission for the warehouse to be built bigger than it should have been. But the council is adamant that it has followed procedure correctly and enforcement notices issued in  were vindicated by an independent planning inspector. Macclesfield MP David Rutley has spoken with the council about Ken and Barbara’s case and they have also approached Councillor Janet Jackson, a member of the planning committee. She said: “Mistakes have been made by the council and the iniduals that have led to this situation. “Hopefully the council can revise its view, negotiate with the family and find another outcome.”   A Cheshire East spokesman said: “The council had made it very clear to the owners that there was no planning permission for the erection of a dwelling and the building, which they had constructed, fell outside the scope of a permission for a warehouse. “The owners chose to ignore the council’s advice and moved into the unauthorised dwelling. “It was acknowledged by the owners’ agents as early as June , that the building under construction fell outside the scope of the permission for a warehouse and, as such, may be the subject of formal action by the council.   The site lies within the green belt, which has strict rules limiting development that can take place. The inspector found the council’s enforcement notices to be sound and fully justied. “The appeal was dismissed. The inspector’s decision also made it very clear that evidence showed that the intention of the owners was always to use the building as a dwelling and not as a warehouse. “On  January , the owners pleaded guilty in court to their failure to comply with the requirements of the notices. Failure to comply with the requirements of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate middleton same","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton did same sweet thing in final stage of pregnancyMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton both took part in the sweet activity when they were seven months pregnantShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  FEB NewsHow sweet! \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge became a mum for the first time back in  and now has three gorgeous children.

The Coast Starlight train , which is popular with tourists and was traveling from Seattle to Los Angeles, got stuck at pm on Sunday night when branches damaged its engine. During the  hour nightmare, travellers rationed food, ran out of drinking water and made makesht nappies out of washcloths and safety pins. They passed the time by dancing in the aisles, making friends with strangers and sharing phones to call family as only one mobile network had a signal. Operator Amtrak kept the passengers on the train because it still had power but the nearest town, Oakridge in Oregon, did not due to the snow.  Passengers said that after the snack cart ran out of food people in first class were fed from the restaurant, followed by those in business class and lastly those in coach. They also complained that Amtrak was charging people for food, water and blankets but the company said in a tweet they would be free.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"engineering works affect line between","story":"NewsEngineering works to affect line between Glasgow Central and AyrPassengers have been advised journey times will be extended with replacement buses operating on part of the route.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsTrack renewal work is taking place between Ayr and Glasgow\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRail passengers have been warned to plan ahead as engineering works take place on the main line between Ayr and Glasgow.

Liam Ewing told jurors: “You have heard how the girl described screaming as he raped her.” He added: “I ask you to examine the evidence. She goes into a lot of detail about what happened to her. I invite you toa guilty verdict.” The alleged victim, who is now , claimed that Curdy, , from Ayr, raped her three times. She alleged that on each occasion he whispered to her afterwards” If you tell anyone I will kill you and your mum.” Curdy, who is on trial at the High Court in Glasgow, denies raping her on ious occasions between April  and August , , at a house in the South of France. Mr Ewing told the jury that the Crown is relying on testimony from the girls mother, who is , to corroborate the rape. She alleges that Curdy also raped her in August  in the South of France. The mothers allegation, which he denies, is not before the jury. Under Scots Law alleged crimes against children committed in another country can be prosecuted here, but not those against adults. The mother claimed that after having consensual sex with her, Curdy went on to rape her. Defence counsel Lorenzo Alonzi told the jury: “If you apply the law, you will find that the correct verdict in this case is acquittal.” Mr Alonzi said in his closing speech that there was absolutely no independent evidence in this case – only the allegations of the girl and her mother. He went on: “There is no DNA evidence, there is no torn clothing, there is no medical evidence and no witnesses who heard screams. “The idea that there was this monstrous threat to kill her and her mum, it doesnt stack up.” Curdy claimed that the two woman made up the allegations about him after he demanded theof his pound, gold and diamond Rolex watch.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"single-primary-school-plan-for-prestonpans-to-go-ahead","story":"The proposal to close the two schools and establish a new primary school covering nursery to P, operating from the existing school sites, followed a public consultation.Councillors agreed to progress the plans at a meeting of East Lothian Council on December .This decision needed to be ratied by Scottish Ministers.The new school will follow a single curriculum and a single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The school structure in the town currently has nursery to P children attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P however, both schools operate their own curriculums independently.Fiona Robertson, the councilrsquos head of education, said: ldquoPrestonpans is the only area in East Lothian where nursery to P and P-P are taught across two schools.ldquoWe believe having one primary school, working under a single management structure, will benefit pupils at all levels of their learning as it does where in the county by ensuring a smoother progression through school and better coherence across the curriculum at all ages and stages.ldquoEducation Scotland has recognised the potential educational benefits and opportunities for greater coherence in the curriculum.ldquoWe have written to staff and parents to advise them of this decision.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Mundellrsquos wan smiles and empty words about doing the best for Scotland as the Government he is a member of readies itself to push us off the no-deal Brexit clf, is as astonishing as it is appalling.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

But some say what might have been a masterplan to increase pressure on Mr Maduro has only pushed the country down an even more chaotic course towards civil war.It was a gesture say critics of Mr Guaido that had more to do with provocation than humanitarianism and which left some global organisations like the UN and the International Committee of the Red Crosswarning all sides of the dangers in ldquoweaponising aid. Perhaps the most worrying aspect in all of this however is the apparent willingness of other outside players to play fast and loose with the fate of Venezuela and its people.Just what did US Senator Mark Rubio think would be the outcome of him posting two photographs of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on his Twitter account on Sunday Itrsquos well known of course that Mr Rubio is an influential voice in Washington on Venezuela policy and a staunch critic of Mr Maduro. But his tweet showing the Libyan leader bloodied and injured shortly before his death at the hands of rebel militiamen is the crudest and most incendiary of messages to Mr Maduro.That Mr Rubio had previously tweeted another photo of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who was captured in  after a US military invasion, is likewise unequivocal it its meaning and can, as intended, only be read one way by Mr Maduro. The message is simple, your time is up and forcenecessary, will be used.How Mr Rubio and those in Washington think such gestures strengthen their case for democratic change in Venezuela is baffling. Surely rather that stoke an already dangerously volatile situation, the US government should be doing all it can to ensure that such a process happens through the ballot box The Trump administration is now clearly losing patience with Mr Maduro and no longer cares how he is removed from office so long as he is and their chosen leader Mr Guaido takes over.Just last week President Trump at a speech in Miami urged ldquoVenezuelan patriots to rise up against the regime. Mr Guaido at the weekend did the same on Twitter.ldquoTodayrsquos events force me to make a decision to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom our country.For many Latin America analysts such talk bodes ill and presents serious warning signs.ldquoThere is no question that a military intervention to resolve the Venezuela crisis is more plausible than ever, Michael Shter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a US-based think- tank, told the Washington Post over the last few days as the crisis deepened.ldquoGuaidorsquos insistence that lsquoall options are on the tablersquo echoes President Trumprsquos words, first uttered in August  and widely interpreted as serious consideration of military action, warned Mr Shter.Some observers however insist that the US history of attempted regime change in the Latin American region and Mr Trumprsquos loose language are both working against the opposition that faces a still formidable foe in Mr Madurorsquos regime.Many Venezuelans remain suspicious of Washingtonrsquos motives, evenyet more defections to the opposition from within the ranks of the Venezuelan security forces have taken place over the past few days.More than  members of Venezuelarsquos armed forces defected during the clashes last weekend, with Mr Guaido promising the defectors would be given amnesty and congratulating them on joining ldquothe right side of history.Mr Maduro meanwhile still believes himself to be on the right side of history evenlast weekendrsquos blockade of foreign aid has left him facing a diplomatic siege.As the crisis worsens UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed for ldquoviolence to be avoided at any cost and insisted everyone should lower tensions.Washington however is paying little heed and more than ever seems intent in doing whatever it takes to get its way in Venezuela. ldquoThe eyes of the entire world are upon you today, every day, and every day in the future, Mr Trump told Mr Madruo in a speech last week. ldquoYou cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you, the US president warned.For now all eyes are on the outcome of yesterdayrsquos meeting in the Colombian capital Bogota between Mr Pence and Mr GuaidoIf indeed all options are on the table, as both men have made clear, then Venezuela might be about to face the most dangerous moment in this crisis so far.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orkney MSP has today, Tuesday, urged the Scottish Government to #pay heed to the realities of fuel poverty.#The figures, published by the Scottish Government, showed that the fuel poverty rate in Orkney was  per cent — compared to  per cent in the City of Edinburgh.“Fuel poverty levels are shameful Scotland-wide in this day and age,# said Mr McArthur.#However, these figures underline that rural and island communities are disproportionately badly affected.“I have consistently made the case for recognition of this alarming disparity, and I am glad that the Housing Minister has now agreed to look at options to recognise that ahead of Stage Two of the Fuel Poverty Bill.“Orkney and other rural and island communities urgently need targeted action to reduce the astronomical rates of fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty. The latest figures provide a timely reminder about the need to get the legislation and policy right.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction.

I would be concernedpeople who voted Leave felt abandoned by the Labour Party. But we are trying to steer a way through what is a very dficult situation created by Theresa May,” he said.“Our strategy has been to try and hold the country together.

David Lammy, a prominent Remain-supporting Labour MP, said Corbyn was “taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time”.: Brexit: Labour to back second referendum in parliamentIt is often said that the EU referendum was held in an attempt to solve an internecine war within the Conservative party. Now, it seems, Labour’s internal troubles could bring about another one.Clearly, the chances of this actually happening will depend on the attitude of many Conservative MPs – and not just Remain ones. Labour’s decision could simply prompt Brexiteer MPs to drop their opposition to May’s deal, fearing the ‘will of the people’ is now pro-Remain.But,a second vote does come about, the big question will be the question. BrexitRef would undoubtedly be a isive affair and there would be a serious risk of a boycott by Brexiteers, which could cause potentially irreparable harm to democracy in this country.So considerable efforts would need to be made to try to bring Farage, Rees-Mogg and the like on board.

And we have called for it to do the same with the two-child cap on claims for tax credits and Universal Credit, and the rape clause that comes with it. Let’s call this what it is, a particularly abhorrent piece of Tory social engineering, which forces women to re-live the trauma of being raped as part of a claim for financial support for a child.These measures, as illustrative as they are, barely scratch the surface of the level of cuts to social security imposed by the Tories since  – and, of course, supported by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government. Billions of pounds slashed from benefits and support programmes for the very people who most need our help: sick, disabled and unemployed people, and those who rely on extra support because they are not paid enough to live on. Cruel cuts underpinned by a cruel sanctions regime, so painfully and accurately portrayed in the film ‘I, Daniel Blake’, based partly on people’s experiences in Scotland.This is the brutal reality of austerity. A political choice to use the power of the state in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, not to make iniduals’ lives better and to improve society as a whole, but to tear people’s lives apart. And this is without even mentioning the tens of billions of pounds cut from our public services.: Tony Blair: Scotland would be independentnot for devolutionAnd it is before we have even begun to consider the Tories’ despicable hostile environment that targets migrants, conceived by Theresa May as Home Secretary and continued under her as Prime Minister. Remember those ad vans sent out by May’s Home Office with the nasty threat “Go home or face arrest”  Policies rooted in the worst instincts of the Tory Party, egged on by sections of the press whose front pages regularly scream about the threat posed by migration but never shout about the positive benefits it brings to our country, our culture and our way of le.But it is not some fanatical Tory clique in England that claims all of this is “necessary”, this is the Conservative Party right across the UK including here in Scotland. Ruth Davidson has proudly talked about how she backed Theresa May as leader, and how she “will back her in the future”. Scottish Secretary David Mundell and stand-in Scottish leader Jackson Carlaw line up foursquare behind the Prime Minister, even as her Brexit shambles goes from farce to horror.This is the Conservative Party that former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair bizarrely said last week had claimed the “middle ground” of politics. If that is the middle ground, I shudder to think what would be right of centre.Scottish Labour has serious work to do, no one in our party is pretending otherwise and no one has ever claimed it is easy-going. We are rebuilding after years of decline and a series of electoral shocks, not least the  General Election when all but one of our  MPs were voted out, including the then leader Jim Murphy.Far from abandoning the mythical “middle ground” which, in truth, only pundits talk about, we are rebuilding on the basis of popular, common sense policies that focus on the real change that Scotland needs. An end to austerity and the cuts to social security and local services, and public ownership of our trains, buses, energy and Royal Mail, to put people before profit. We need Labour governments in Scotland and across the UK to put this into practice.Of course, it was gravely disappointing that just over a week ago a small group of Labour MPs chose to walk away, to join forces with former Tory MPs in a new Independent Group. In going, they have raised some important issues about Labour, not least the issue of antisemitism which we are determined to root out of our party and wider society. There is no place for antisemitism in the Labour Party.But they have also been clear that their disagreements range wider and are on matters of policy. In a magazine interview, one of the former Labour MPs has already criticised plans to bring the railways into public ownership and raise the top rate of tax. Another has suggested the group could replace the DUP in propping up the Tory Government. The first act of one of their former Tory colleagues was to declare that the coalition government, which ushered in austerity and led to record levels of poverty and homelessness, “did a marvellous job”.: Lesley Riddoch: Citizens’ Assemblies could help build a new ScotlandThese are very dferent ideas to the ones that proved so popular in the  election and which they were elected to Parliament on, so it is right that their constituents get the chance to ask them in by-elections what they now stand for. The group claims to represent a new, forward-looking “centre ground”.

He confirmed he would table an amendment to today’s motion seeking MPs support for his party’s own customs union deal.The Prime Minister said the Brexit deal would be voted on in the Commons by  March and thatit was rejected again by MPs, there would be a vote the following day on whether to leave the EU without a deal.If the Commons rejects a no-deal scenario, there would then be a vote on  March on whether to ask the EU for a “short, limited extension”.Downing Street declined to say how Conservative MPs would be whipped in the votes or whatof extension would be offeredit came to a motion to extend Article .Mrs May said: “Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article  extended.“Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on  March.“An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.“What kind of message would that send to the more than  million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now “And the House should be clear that a short extension – not beyond the end of June – would almost certainly have to be a one-off.“If we had not taken part in the European Parliament elections, it would be extremely dficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper clf edge in a few months’ time.”The Prime Minister added: “An extension cannot take no deal off the table. The only way to do that is to revoke Article , which I shall not do, or agree a deal.”Mrs May had faced a wave of resignations by ministers determined to vote for an amendment from Labour MP Yvette Cooper, seeking to tie the government’s hands on an extension to Article .The Prime Minister said her proposals met the timetable set out in Ms Cooper’s amendment. She called on MPs to reject it in votes today, arguing that “tying the government’s hands by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the United Kingdom is governed, and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions”.In a bid to prevent a rebellion by Tory Brexiteers in two weeks’ time, Mrs May said work would continue on ways to avoid the controversial Irish border backstop from coming into force.“The UK and EU have agreed to consider a joint work stream to develop alternative arrangements to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland,” she told MPs. “This work will be done in parallel with the future relationship negotiations and is without prejudice to them.“Our aim is to ensure that, eventhe full future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, the backstop is not needed because we have a set of alternative arrangements ready to go.”The Prime Minister’s critics failed to welcome her U-turn. Mr Corbyn said that “until the Prime Minister is clear what alternative she would put forward in that circumstance, then she is continuing to run down the clock”.He also confirmed that eventhe Prime Minister’s deal was approved by MPs, Labour would seek to make it subject to a “confirmatory referendum”.Veteran Europhile Tory Sir Kenneth Clarke said Mrs May was simply “pushing back the clf edge”.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Prime Minister to prepare for a longer extension, saying his party was selecting candidates for the European elections in May.Mr Blackford said Mrs May “could not be trusted” not to dodge another meaningful vote. He urged her to hold votes ruling out no deal now.A cross-party group of MPs will push for a second EU referendum today. An amendment by the Independent Group, supported by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, instructs the Prime Minister to table a motion for debate before  March, setting out the steps necessary for preparing a public vote on whether to leave the EU or remain a member.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them. One Jewish peer told colleagues that it was “dficult to go amongst the Jewish community and be a member of the Labour party”.Responding to the wave of resignations, the peers were nearly unanimous in saying they “understand what they’re doing” and “neither condone nor condemn it”, the source said.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell admitted that the party needed to be “quicker and fiercer” in responding toincidents of anti-Semitism.In a bid to calm the anger over his handling of the anti-Semitism storm, Corbyn appointed the former minister Lord Falconer to lead a review of the party’s processes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school.

Our partners are being intimidated. Two years ago I was approached by MI on the Grosvenor and they followed my partner as she was bringing my daughter to crèche.“The try to intimidate our family members when we’re not there. It’s clear that the ‘reformed’ police service, as they are called by those who work alongside them, are only accommodating to those who tow the line of the establishment. Those who stand in opposition to the British police force in Ireland are fair game, and that also extends to our families.”He continued: “It’s no coincidence that this attempt at criminalising the republican socialist movement, it is starting to rise again when our party is starting to grow and we are doing fantastic work in Belfast.“It will fail today as it has done over the  years of the existence of our party.

We understand each other’s sense of self and sense of humour.“In politics we agree on a lot more than we disagree on. Brexit must not be allowed to take any of this away from us.”He said the current position of the Brexit process poses “unique and unprecedented challenges” for Ireland.We are but onlookers to this entire mess, something which we did not ask for or create but which nevertheless impacts on us heavilyLisa Chambers, Fianna FailFacebookTwitterMr Coveney added that the Bill is a key part of the Irish government’s plans to ramp up the no-deal preparations.The Omnibus Bill, known as the Miscellaneous ProvisionsBill, is made up of  parts and was prepared by nine ministers.The proposed laws cover a wide range of areas and focus on protecting Irish citizens’ rights, supporting businesses and jobs, healthcare, transport, education and energy.Fianna Fail’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said: “With  days to Brexit it is extremely disappointing and worrying that we find ourselves in this situation having to pass emergency legislation to try and minimise the damage to our country and our citizens because of the UK’s Government’s failure to raty the withdrawal treaty which they negotiated and helped to craft.“We are but onlookers to this entire mess, something which we did not ask for or create but which nevertheless impacts on us heavily.”She went on to accuse the Irish Government of giving opposition parties insufficient time to scrutinise the Bill.“It is in all of our interests to ensure that this Bill is as robust as it can possibly be and it is our opinion that greater time should have been given to this crucial piece of legislation,” she added.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said: “Economic problems will very quickly lead to a sour political atmosphere and it is likely that Ireland will be blamed, especially by those Brexiteers who have lied to the British people about the EU for many years, and who have lied about their fantasy of unregulated trade after Brexit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"esb pensioners demonstrate against 10year","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was well-known and much-loved in this city’s dance music circles and there is no doubt that Derry ravers who cut their teeth on the dancefloors of the North West would have styled it out to his uplting house music. In the days when the Troubles were still raging, Protestants and Catholics started to come together having found a dferent kind of religion in dance music and Hurley’s pulpit was the DJ box.Chris took the ‘Barn’ in Kelly’s, Portrush, where a meagre  or  punters turned up for his first ‘Club Night’ and, within weeks, transformed it into a heaving success with , dance music lovers from Derry and all over the North turning up every week to make it an unbridled success.The Point Inn just over the border in Quigley’s Point, Donegal, was another club – a place of the stuff of legends for Derry ravers – where they went in their droves while Chris stood smiling at the decks.Derry DJs, promoters, those with fond memories of their raving youth and those who continued to enjoy Chris’ music over the years, shared their shock, disbelief and sadness following the news of his death on February .Charlie Dillon, also known as DJ Bill-X, believes it is only fitting that Derry’s dance music community, of which Chris was a huge part, should pay tribute to the man who has been hailed a ‘pioneer’ and ‘legend’ of the Irish dance music scene.“I met Chris in the early s, I had been working in Kelly’s nightclub when I was a student in Portrush,” he said.“Chris had only started doing nights in the famous Barn - within a few weeks he was catapulted into playing packed houses and bringing guest DJs from all over the UK. Chris was one of the reasons I started to DJ myself. He was a very modest and witty fella, but he knew his music inside and out and stuck to the type of music that he wanted to play, he DJed all over Ireland and the UK. A few years ago we were very lucky to get into guest DJ at our re-rub nights.“Chris was a true pioneer and was the godfather of house in Northern Ireland and his legacy will live on. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hurley family and his little daughter, Scarlett.”Derry DJ, Paul Moran, better known in music circles as DJ Paul P, described Chris as an ‘innovator’ and a ‘legend’.“I first met Chris in  when I clamoured over the DJ box in Kelly’s to ask him to be our guest DJ at new night we were starting in the Point Inn,” he said.“Thankfully he agreed and the rest as they say is history. Our paths crossed many times over the intervening years. I will always remember Chris as an innovator, a DJ of principal who would not compromise his musical style to please the masses.“Chris set the bar high for all others that would follow. He was a real gentleman and a legend of Irish dance music. He will be sorely missed and his legacy will live long in the hearts of the thousands of people who were lucky enough to attend Kellys in the early days of the rave - a magical time made by Chris Hurley.”“He was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.”Another of the city’s home-grown talents, DJ Darren McMenamin said Chris was an inspiration to him and set him on the path to do what he truly loves.“Although I was into dance house music around the late s early s, it wasn’t until  and my first visit to Kelly’s, witnessing one of Chris Hurley’s now legendary all night DJ sets, that I even considered the thought of being a DJ,” he said.“Up on the Decks, top off, , people eating out of the palm of his hand...hanging on every tune! Everyone focused on him. I was instantly drawn into the scene.“After going week in, week out, for a few months, the Point Inn opened on Sundays with Chris at the helm. I was there the first night and didn’t take long to be over chatting to Chris about music and some general trainspotting on my behalf.“He was always generous with his time and knowledge and a true inspiration for me and many like me. After a couple of years raving I then went on to become a DJ myself and anytime I ran into Chris he always had time for chat and always showed me a lot of respect.“In more recent years we spoke a lot through Facebook and he invited me along to play at his Barn -year reunions in Sandino’s which was a real honour.“He was a gentleman and a true pioneer of the dance music scene and will be sorely missed.”Stephen Porter from Derry-based dance organisation Jika Jika, said Chris had the ability to unite people through his music: “We were very shocked and saddened to hear the news about Chris illness.“I was lucky to have got to know Chris over the years and he was always an inspirational figure to me and someone I looked up to greatly. His passion for music was infectious and his mannerisms would make you feel at ease.“His legacy is that of someone that brought a war-torn country together through music and firmly established dance music in NI. Deepest sympathies to all Chris friends and family.”While Ann Harley, Proprietor of Sandino’s, said: “Chris ran our Saturday nights for almost a year in . I had missed the Kelly’s Barn years, so didn’t realise at the time how well known and respected he was.“He put  per cent into every night he ran for us ,best DJs, classy posters and flyers, great attention to detail. Apart from that, from the start, he just fitted in and became a friend to a lot of us. Can’t believe we won’t see him again, as everyone says, a proper gentleman.

Not least from Chris’ dear friends.Mark Mc Dermott from Dungiven said he was honoured to have been his close friend: “To me, Chris Hurley was the epitome of a gentleman, kindness, the most great friend, and musician. Also the epitome of class but so humble at the same time. To know him well was a true honour. He was such an inspiration to me in all angles of le and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. “Chris had talent to burn as a DJ from such a young age and was a pioneer in music, the first to create the house music dance scene in Ireland that will forever be remembered as the Love Years, aptly named as he not only bridged the religious ide at the time with music but he brought all the youth together. He was a living legend but his legend will forever live on in my heart, and the hearts of many.“Gone but never ever forgotten - the Godfather of House, but most importantly my dearest friend and brother in spirit.”Hector McLennan, a dance music promoter from Strabane who has passed the genes onto his own daughter, celebrated Ibiza club DJ, Loéca, paid a heartfelt tribute to ‘the Godfather of House’.“Chris Hurleys name is synonymous with the introduction, development and explosion of dance music in Ireland,” he said.“He has earned a permanent place in the history of our dance culture. He was Northern Irelands godfather of house. Im not saying that he was the only one, there were others who played their part, but he was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.“Chris had the tunes that every DJ wanted. Ive often been in situations with people in the music business and we would hear a tune. One of us would always say, \"That was a big Chris Hurley tune.\" Like DJs of his time, his message was spread through DJ Mix Tapes. What car didnt have a Chris Hurley tape back in the day “Over the last few years I enjoyed some great nights with Chris. We reminisced about the good old days and we hit it off because we were both excited about the current house music scene. Stand out moments include driving to Portrush after Sven Vath in Eglinton to hear Chris in Portrush with John Morrison on tow, a mad Paddys weekend in Portrush in  and of course having him as a guest in Sugar on a night co-promoted with Jika Jika. His love and passion for House Music had never faltered. He didnt want to re-live his success of the past but was still an innovator pushing out the barriers and seeking out those fresh new sounds.“I will always remember Chris for his love and passion for House Music. Chris Hurley, thank you for the memories.”\"He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music...he led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"Neal McClelland, DJ and Presenter at Downtown Radio and Cool FM, also paid his respects recognising how powerful Chris’ music was in turbulent times: “Chris was an innovator and total gentleman that loved the groove and helped shape the wave of rave that swept across our country and created the bridge between two religions that paved the path for the future through music.”Darren Drake, DJ and good friend, said: “Chris was a devoted father, a loving son, brother and uncle. Ever since our first meeting, in those halcyon days of the house music revolution of the early s, of which he was a true pioneer, Chris Hurley has been, and forever shall be, my inspiration and my friend.”Ray McLaughlin, also known as DJ X-Ray: “Chris paved the way for a whole new generation of DJs some of us wouldnt still be DJing todayit wasnt for his vision in the early s.”Glen Molly said he wished Chris could have been there for the th anniversary of the Barn: “The  years of the Barn was missing him,” he said, “I would really have loved him to have played it.”Timmy Stewart, a DJ from Belfast and close friend to Chris, said: “I loved the fact Chris was so upfront with his music.“We had heard Secret Knowledge’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ played on the Essential Selection one Friday night and he played a white label of it the very next night. I always felt privileged to be exposed to that level of cutting edge music especially at that age and time.”Col Hamilton, Promoter at Lush! Official , paid this tribute on behalf of the club where Chris first burst onto the scene: “We were saddened to hear the news of the passing of original Kelly’s resident DJ Chris Hurley.“Back in early  when Kelly’s Barn was a live band and rock venue, the late James Kelly let a young local lad start a Saturday ‘Club Night’, the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Hurley started with about  people on the first night and within six months was attracting thousands of clubbers from across the North and Donegal flocking to hear the latest UK European house music. To say he started a legacy would be only fair and Lush! would not be here  years later as one of the UK’s leading venues without Chriss original vision.“We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to His Family circle and his young daughter. Until we meet again, old friend.”Liverpool DJ, Steve Vertigo, said a phone call in  from Chris went on to ‘open the door on a magical Northern Irish adventure that has rumbled on for  years’.\"When I met him we shared similar hairand were both bang in the middle of an incredible love affair with house music,\" he said.\"That first night waiting in the Barn for it to open with hundreds of people outside banging on the walls chanting Let us in!” like some sort of fantastic zombie survival film was only a hint of the craziness to come. That first booking turned into a friendship and many repeat visits hanging out for days after gigs in Portrush with Chris and Joanne. He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music. Always ready with a laugh and a plan and an appetite for good old-fashioned fun. He led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"In  I played one last time with him in the main room at Kelly’s, a reunion and a waypoint on a long journey that now feels so short. It brought back memories of beautul, messy hazy times in Portrush when we were all young and had no idea how big this dream of utopia would grow.\"Ill remember his smile and the way hed look you up and down, head tilted slightly back as hed work out whether you were talking rubbish and how he was going to wind you up. He was a romantic and a dreamer and the gods know we need more of those.\"My heartfelt sympathies to his loved ones, family and friends. He was one of the good ones. Rise in Power, Chris. Big Love.\"The Hurley family said that they have taken heart in the tremendous outpouring of love and sympathy since Chris’ death.In a statement they said: “We are finding it very hard to take in, we miss him so much - he was so special to each and every one of us.“As I said before Christopher was our hero what a fighter to the end - he always believed he was going to get better.“We as a family are so proud of what Christopher achieved through his music bringing everyone together. Tributes that have been made to Christopher are so special to us knowing how well he was thought of and showed us everyone thought the same as us...what a gentleman he was.”The late Chris was son to Joe and Margaret, loving father of Scarlett and the late Ava, brother of Joseph, Sharon and Rhonda, a loving brother-in-law and uncle and a legend in Irish dance music.PICTURED ABOVE: The late Chris Hurley whose passion for his music made him a favourite with dance music lovers in Derry and beyond."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wMlxcXC8yNTE1MjI1MFxcXC9BZGFtLU1VUlJBWS1MR0JULnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImU0MDM1NTkzZTc1MGNmNzI0MzY0NmU2NTQ0NjhiYzhiMzIxYzVlYTkifQ==/adam-murray-lgbt.png","title":"lgbt history celebrated outing past event museum free derry","story":"The award-winning Museum of Free Derry will host the Derry Hub of OUTing the Past, the International Festival of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History this coming weekend.Four speakers will each highlight an aspect of LGBT+ history in what’s sure to be a very memorable afternoon event taking place on Saturday in association with Cara-Friend.From noon, Edmund Lynch will discuss his work recording over  interviews with older LGBTQ as well as with important political supporters who played their part like ex-Presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, all telling the story of the struggle of LGBT+ people in Ireland to become full citizens in their own country.At .pm, Kate Drinane, from the National Gallery of Ireland will talk about key works from the National Gallery of Ireland’s collection, with focus on the narrative of Irish LGBT+ history through art and how art can help us explore and understand how Ireland’s LGBT+ community has been shaped by it’s past.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAt .pm, a talk by Adam Murraywill offer an insight into the mindsets and needs of LGBT+ people who wrote to Cara-Friend between  and , offering illuminating research into the period.

I went to St Eugenes PS it was such a great school.\"After doing my +, I went to Thornhill for all of my secondary schooling. I had an amazing time there the teachers were so supportive and Miss ODoherty in P.E taught me so many le lessons between reminding me to tie my shoelaces so I wouldnt trip again”.And…“I wasn’t musical in school I was told I was actually tone deaf which knocked my confidence for years and I didnt think about music until I went to university in Leeds.\"I always wrote poetry and stories, it was a way to escape the noise of the world and create a safer world to be in and after I started putting the words to music they started coming to le and took on new energy. I met a producer in Leeds called Mike Brown and he helped me record my first two singles, ‘Autumn Sky’ and ‘Free’ ”.Then what ...\"These songs helped get me the opportunity to go back to Zimbabwe and there I ended up shooting the video for ‘Autumn Sky’, as well as collaborating with chart topping African artists including Dhadza D, Tehn Diamond and more.\"Im lucky that music allowed me to travel and Ive performed across Africa including Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa and more. Ive been home since  writing and recording since and last year saw me release my biggest single to date, ‘Moved On’ which got , streams in its first month on Spoty.\"I also played Stendhal Festival, Fringe Festival, as well as Foyle Maritime Festival, played live on the BBC and headlined my own show at the Nerve Centre. And it was the first time Id played at home with my full band which was awesome!\"I also was the vocalist and songwriter for the Peace Four project, Traditions Meet which saw me work on Irish tunes and jigs with a collection of cross community artists which was led by An Culturlann and Sid Peacock.What have you got lined up “I’m working with Rioghnach Connolly, Nerve Centres Artist in Residence on a collaborative song writing project.

Nobody is saying that Ryan Vail is in any way pushy by the way.You’re the queen of self-promotion, is it hard work “Yes! Its so dficult. You have to be the fan, the manager and the singer. You have to believe that people need to listen to your music you have to make sure your quality of music is great and then you still need to perform the music perfectly.\"It can be a lot of pressure but you have so much control, and I like being in control. Its easier with the Internet and social media as you can reach a wider audience than ever before but you cant forget that you still need an audience who will leave their houses and watch you perform

I would like to see this work completed soon.Cllr Curran said the petition contained the names of concerned parents, community representatives and local residents and hoped the new path can be delivered sooner, rather than later.ldquoParents are keen to see the path provided to increase the safety of children who walk to and from the school. While new speed limits have been introduced in the village, speeding drivers remains a concern, he said.ldquoThe safety of the children who attend the primary school is of paramount importance as indeed is the safety of residents who walk along this particular route.The local politician, who thanked Angela Wills for helping compile the petition, hopes roads officials will act, highlighting the importance of having a safe connection between St Maryrsquos and Chapeltown.Cllr Curran said that while the villagersquos new speed limits were a welcome addition, the provision of the new path must be a priority to help ensure that a busy rural area is safer for all road users.Cllr Enright said community groups around the Dunsford area had joined forces to support the campaign for the new path to connect the school to the nearby church and community centre. He also confirmed that another petition calling for the footpath had secured around  signatures.He continued: ldquoSome progress to deliver the new path was achieved last month with a site visit by roads officials which I organised when school principal Ronan Fitzpatrick and parish priest Fr Gerald McCloskey had the opportunity to walk the route with them.ldquoHopefully this campaign is now on the cards for success.

It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9470990.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March . Wersquore really looking forward to it.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Young people were also involved in the protest at Craigavon Civic CentreUp to  protesters were around the Civic Centre, most from the unions, GMB, Unite and NIPSA who quietly protested at the front of the building.During the more raucous demonstrations outside the chamber, some councillors felt staff were at risk of a window coming in and they were asked to move for their own safety.One councillor said the police should be called and another Cllr Arnold Hatch suggested the flashing lights, which demonstrators were using against the window, could trigger elipespy in sufferers.Many councillors expressed ‘disgust’ and ‘shock’ that information from a prior leisure services committee meeting had been leaked to the Lurgan Mail.Unions members protesting at any privatising of leisure services in the ABC Council areaIt had been revealed that a vote supporting an option to create a council-owned companyhad split the leisure services committee with the DUP and Ulster Unionists’ majority vote swinging in favour of the Co-Co.Unions representing staff at council facilities were in uproar and lobbied council intensely since that meeting several weeks ago to have the service remain in-house.However at last night’s full council meeting, it was decided to reverse the Leisure Services Committee option and keep the leisure services management in-house.After going into ‘Confidential Business’ the Council spent several hours without journalists discussing the matter and issued a statement following the meeting.Unions, including the GMB, Unite and NIPSA were out in force a protest against privatising leisure servicesLater an ABC Council statement revealed councillors had unanimously agreed to transform leisure services in-house.The statement said: “With the brand new £m South Lake Leisure Centre construction due to complete on schedule in summer , elected representatives reviewed a number of options on how the new facility would be managed.“This review was undertaken to ensure that ABC Council’s largest capital investment project undertaken to date would be placed within the most appropriate structures to ensure its long-term sustainability, provide full value for money for ratepayers and maximise the potential of this flagship public resource.Was using phone while driving Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“The options included in-house transformation, creating a Council-owned company fully answerable to elected representatives and ratepayers, or appointing an established leisure operator to run the facility.Young Oliver McKenna protesting outside Craigavon Civic Centre with his dad Paul“It was agreed that Council would continue deliver leisure services directly by owning, operating and maintaining the assets, and employing all staff.“Under the plan agreed, Council will be fully responsible for the efficient operation and growth of the exciting new development and in its future.”There was jubilation among workers in Unite, GMB and NIPSA late last night as they heard reports that ABC councillors voted to overturn a previous recommendation to outsource the new Craigavon Leisure centre. Gareth Scott, Regional Officer for Unite welcomed the decision by councillors and thanked those parties and iniduals who had supported the in-house delivery model from the start.“All three workforce unions, Unite, GMB and NIPSA, at ABC council came together to build an unstoppable campaign to demand the new Craigavon Lakes leisure centre remain under council management and not be outsourced to a private or CoCo management company. “The experience in other parts of NI where leisure services have been outsourced has been unormly bad. “This represents a convincing victory for the workforce who mobilised against this decision and the huge numbers in the local community who raised concerns. Unite would like to thank those parties and inidual councillors who from the start supported the in-house model but we also welcome the fact that one of the two parties who had previously voted for outsourcing decided to reverse that stance and act in the best interests of everyone concerned.“This vote will ensure that the new leisure centre will operate in-house for its first year of operation. All unions must remain focussed on ensuring that there is no backtracking on this commitment and that the new leisure centre remains under council management thereafter. Our local public services must remain fully democratically-accountable there should be no diminution of either the status of workers or decisions that put generating surpluses above the needs of service users.“This is a victory for common-sense delivered thanks to all our members and shop stewards and those of our partner unions, the GMB and NIPSA,” Mr Scott concluded.Sinn Féin Councillor Catherine Nelson said: “We have been engaging extensively with the unions, leisure staff, council officers and other parties.“Despite Unionist support to out source the centre at committee level a few weeks ago we are delighted that after much negotiation the in-house working model enjoyed full party support.“This was a vote of confidence in our extremely capable and talented leisure staff. “We look forward to working with them to ensure the delivery of the high quality facility our ratepayers deserve.”Independent Cllr Paul Berry said he is delighted with decision“Following many weeks of discussions around the new operating model for this new state-of-the-art leisure centre I am delighted that the right decision has been made to keep the services In-House with a review in one year of it opening its doors.“Whilst I appreciate it was on legal grounds that the Option  could not be voted on, as it did not have the % support in the Chamber, this outcome is most welcome for our fantastic staff.“From day one I was supportive of keeping it In-House because I believe in our staff and have every confidence in them working with us all to ensure we have a first class facility for our rate payers. I know many of our staff and they are professional, innovative and passionate about their jobs and it’s vital we support them and ensure certainty in thier employment.“Could I commend the Unions for their work. I always had productive meetings with them throughout this process and I know they are keen to move forward and help deliver the Transfomation with us for the benefit of all.”try catch            ..

Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Representing the Central Craigavon area, Cllr Lennon said: “My former party has lost contact with the grassroots and no longer represents the best interest of the electorate, choosing instead to put media sound bites in place of real action.“Throughout my term as a Councillor I represented all of the constituents within my area and during my tenure as group leader I always put the community interest first.“My efforts to move away from the sectarian politics associated with the old Craigavon Council were consistently stled by the lack of clear direction from leadership and I can no longer allow my name to be associated with this isive politicking.“As a republican I believe that building a shared future and creating across-community trust is much more than just a soundbite, it should be our main task as political representatives. Following the resignations of Cllrs Curran and Cairns from Council I found myself not only frustrated in efforts to further this objective but increasingly isolated from the politics promoted by my party colleagues. The forthright honesty of the Aontú leadership impressed me and I believe this fresh political party offers a real alternative for Republicans who genuinely want to create a new Republic that is erse and accommodating of all our citizens.”Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said: “Fergal Lennon is exactly the calibre of public representative that Aontú is looking to attract as the party continues to develop and grow - a Councillor that will bring about the most effective political representation for all the people of this island.“While the party as a whole continues to forge head, founding  Cumann in  weeks across the country, it is people like Fergal, who will help build in their local communities.“We are delighted that Fergal is now joining our team. I am confident that Cllr Lennon will be joined by several more Councillors following the local election in May.“The north of Ireland is being hammered by food, housing and health poverty. Enterprise and the economy are not getting the supports they need. With Stormont in stalemate, we have direct rule in all but name as the third Westminster budget is being implemented. The DUP are the only party in power through their Confidence and Supply Agreement and yet they are completely unrepresentative of the people of the north on a range of dferent issues. “The two governments need to implement Joint Authority to get departmental decisions made and to provide the necessarily incentive to get the DUP to fulfil their responsibilities. The All Ireland economy must be built to mitigate against the worst excesses of Brexit. The establishment parties are all wedded to theto the pre-existing Stormont. Aontú sees the need to move beyond the old failed model. Aontú is the voice of change and the addition of Cllr Lennon, a true champion of the people, to our team, proves this point conclusive.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
