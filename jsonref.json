With the latest statics showing the university emits around 3.7kg of carbon emissions each year, it is hoped the move will drastically reduce its carbon footprint. (Stock image)\u0027Declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words. I truly believe we face a defining moment in global history and Goldsmiths now stands shoulder to shoulder with other organisations willing to call the alarm and take urgent action to cut carbon use.\u0027As well as the beef ban and 10p levy on single-use water bottles and plastic cups, there are plans to install more solar panels across the college\u0027s New Cross campus in south-east London and switch to a 100 per cent clean energy supplier as soon as possible.          Professor Corner (pictured at The Fashion Awards in London 2018) said she believed \u0027we face a defining moment in global history\u0027 and that Goldsmiths now stood with other organisations willing to take urgent actionOfficials said Goldsmiths will also continue to invest in its allotment area and identify other places where planting could help to absorb carbon dioxide.The university will also review how all students can access modules which cover climate change and the role of both iniduals and organisations in reducing carbon emissions. Figures show that Goldsmiths emits around 3.7kg of carbon emissions each year, the college said.Referring to the statistic in a blog, Mr Leam said: \u0027It is clear our university has a huge carbon footprint. The promise to have ended this by 2030 at the latest, with the hope of doing so by 2025, is one which is needed.\u0027Whilst this planaction is only the beginning, and much work is yet to be done, it is fantastic to see Goldsmiths taking responsibility and responding to its impact on the climate.\u0027Invoking the words of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, \u0027Our house is on fire\u0027, Mr Leam added: \u0027I believe Frances Corner and the university management are realising this and making these changes to put their part of the house fire out.\u0027The SU will be a part of this process every step of the way to make sure this stays true, seeking to speed the process up wherever possible and will keep the college community updated throughout.\u0027          Earlier today the university took to Twitter to announce its environmental mission with its followers         The university (pictured), which is situated south-east London, also plans to switch to a 100 per cent clean energy supplier as soon as possibleRosie Rogers, climate emergency campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: \u0027It\u0027s encouraging to see an institution like Goldsmiths not simply declaring a climate emergency, but acting on it.\u0027From energy use, to food sales and plastic pollution - all universities and organisations with campus sites can make changes across their facilities that are better for our planet.\u0027We call on others to urgently follow suit, and to include cutting all ties from fossil fuel funding in their climate emergency response.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Hereford cattle stand just 3 5 feet tall smallest Europe","story":"Share this article He said: \u0027People\u0027s first reactions to seeing the cows is quite shocked as there aren\u0027t really any miniature Herefords in the UK.\u0027People have an idea of what they expect the cows to look like and the size they\u0027ll be.\u0027Because this breed of cow is so docile, people will find themselves getting very fond of them very quickly.\u0027The cows, which are pasture fed, are said to actually help the environment through improving soils that capture carbon dioxide.As well as this, it\u0027s said pasture fed animals produce better quality meat and milk.Malcolm added: \u0027Farming is an important part of what we do, but as time as passed we have really developed into a retreat as well - for example my wife is an equine therapist and I\u0027m a professional sound therapist.\u0027We\u0027re here to help people be the best and happiest they can be, and the natural backdrop of the farm is really conducive to that work.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman answered uh 200 times Swiss citizenship test","story":"Share this article After being rejected by her local canton, the woman took her case to the Swiss Federal Court, claiming the recordings of the interview were taken without her consent. The federal judge said that the language diploma she holds from the Vocational Training Centre Pfäffikon SZ was not sufficient, and ruled that she must improve her grasp of the Swiss language before she can reapply for citizenship.  Candidates for Swiss citizenship must demonstrate at least an A2 level writing ability (elementary) and B1 (intermediate) spoken skills under the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Male model accuses Katy Perry pulling pants expose birthday party","story":"Share this article Kloss said that he made a minimal amount of money and any press he could have generated from appearing in the video was tightly controlled by Perry\u0027s team at the time, which later contributed to his fear of speaking out against her.\u0027I made around $650 in total off of Teenage Dream,\u0027 he said. \u0027I was lorded over by her reps, about not discussing a single thing about anything regarding Katy publicly.

His other was seized when he was arrested in July after landing back on US soil following three-week trip to Paris.In total, Epstein\u0027s properties are valued at close to $150 million. There is the Paris bolthole where he spent the weeks before returning to the US and getting arrested on the tarmac as his plane touched down at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. The $9 million pied-a-terre is located on one of the nicest blocks in the City of Lights, and Epstein traveled there frequently, often spending a few months at the apartment each summer. The raid came at the same morning that Attorney General Bill Barr issued a stark warning to Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s alleged co-conspirators, telling them they \u0027should not rest easy\u0027.         While Epstein, left, was the only person charged the Manhattan U.S. Attorney pledged to \u0027stand for victims\u0027 following Epstein\u0027s death on Saturday morning.

Any co-conspirators should not rest easy.\u0027The victims deserve justice and they will get it.\u0027 He also slammed the handling of Epstein by the Manhattan Correctional Center after it was revealed a corrections officer had not checked on the pedophile for several hours before he hanged himself in his cell in the special housing unit.Barr, who said he was \u0027appalled\u0027 and \u0027angry\u0027 at the failure to \u0027adequately secure\u0027 Epstein, added: \u0027This sex trafficking case was very important to the Department of Justice and to me personally.\u0027Most importantly this case was important to the victims who had the courage to come forward and deserve the opportunity to confront the accused in the courtroom.\u0027I was appalled, and indeed the whole department was, and frankly angry to learn of the MCC\u0027s failure to adequately secure this prisoner.\u0027We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.\u0027We will get to the bottom of what happened and there will be accountability.\u0027A former close associate of the late mobster John Gotti Sr., Lewis Kasman, said he heard Barr paid the MCC a visit around the time Epstein was with bruises on his neck.

Our counter terrorist command immediately stood up and the joint CT team which includes police and state and fed agencies, have assessed all available info in relation to his crime and it is not currently classed as a terrorism based incident.Paul Walker, a Seven cameraman, was on the scene and followed the chase through the city, filming the arrest near the corner of Carrington and Wynyard streets.Walker said the man with the chair, whom he identified as a bank worker, had used the chair “like a lion tamer”, trying to turn the man around as he ran through the city streets. He said firefighters were trying to move behind him. It was a case of people who didn’t know each other coming together trying to deal with the situation, he said. They had moved through the city streets and the firefighters were calling out to people to run away, Walker said. “One guy wanted to kill him, but the firies tried to settle him down. Once he was in a position that was compliant everyone was just trying to work out why.”Nine and Seven News have both reported the name of the man arrested today. The NSW police commissioner will be addressing the media in about 30 minutes, and I’ll bring you the updates from that press conference.An Uber driver said he had just picked up an elderly couple from Crown Casino when he saw traffic had stopped on King and Clarence, and people fleeing.“All of a sudden this guy appears with a knife in his hand, covered in blood on his shirt. Next thing, I thought I obviously can’t go through all those cars and, as I’m thinking about doing something, the guy jumps on the front of the car ... and gets up to the very top. I froze for a split second but then I thought I hope he’s not covered in explosives or anything and I quickly accelerated and veered to my left on Clarence Street.Then I made a right turn to get back on to York Street and there he was again being chased near York and Clarence, by the police and the public, by firies, with chairs and everything they could get their hands on.I think I saw a couple of police officers, they didn’t have tasers or anything but they had their guns drawn on him. He was fearless, he was completely fearless. He was on something, I don’t know what he was on. It was a scary moment, I’m sure for a lot of people in Sydney.We posted this earlier, but here again is the footage of the incident this driver is speaking about. This is an evolving story, but here’s what we know so far.  Australia has confirmed the woman’s death is linked to the stabbing incident.Her body was found inside the unit at 3.15 this afternoon, more than an hour after police received the first reports of a knife-wielding man trying to stab people outside in the street.Police have cordoned off the Clarence Street apartment building. Over the last half hour a number of people – apparently residents – have been escorted out by police. Many of them appeared shocked, and some where emotional. Police are due to address the media again in about an hour.Police are reassuring people inside the building that they’re safe and to sit tight. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has responded to the incident, which he described as “deeply concerning”. Australia reporter Michael McGowan is outside 118 Clarence Street, the apartment block where the woman’s body was found. He said police had escorted a woman out of the building – she was not handcuffed – and she sat in the back of an unmarked police car.The body of a woman has been found at a unit on Clarence Street but police don’t know if the death is connected to the stabbing.Inquiries are under way after the body of a woman was found inside a unit on Clarence Street, Sydney, about 3.15pm today.Officers from Sydney City police area command are on the scene and will conduct inquiries into whether the incident is linked to an earlier stabbing at a hotel on the corner of Clarence and King streets.Michael McGowan reports that police have left the press conference area and have gone to a crime scene on the north-east corner of Clarence and King.Traffic and public transport remains disrupted as officers continue their investigation across multiple crime scenes.The Clarence Street entrance of Wynyard station is closed, as is King Street between Clarence and York, and Clarence (northbound) between Market and King. Some buses are have erted to nearby streets to pick up passengers.Paul O’Shaughnessy and his brother Luke, from Manchester, were in their office on King Street when they heard a disturbance outside the building.The brothers and two of their colleagues saw the alleged attacker wielding what Paul said was knife and covered in blood, and chased him.He told media at the scene that, together with other onlookers, they managed to subdue the alleged offender. Paul said the man – whom he described as caucasian with curly hair – had yelled “extremist” slogans but declined to repeat what he had said.

Pushing past us down into the subway were kids in private-school uniforms and office types, all with their loafers and heels and buttery leather briefcases. Meanwhile, I followed the maids, the construction workers and the other nannies up to the street. The working class, I thought to myself, and the phrase buoyed me a little, waking me up after the long sleepy ride from Brooklyn. We were the invisible forces, the childcare workers and housekeepers, arriving just in time for our bosses to make their way to work. We were the foundation of that city.As a first-generation college graduate, I had never been anything but working class. Every job I’d had involved some amount of waiting on people wealthier than I was, in restaurants, offices or their homes. On the Upper East Side, I’d been hired to take care of a toddler. She was 18 months old, walking and very verbal for her age. I’d already been nannying full-time for years, in other parts of the city, and I’d sworn that this time I wouldn’t get attached.Over the next three years, my mind wandered in new ways as I cut crusts off of countless peanut butter sandwiches and repeatedly read Richard Scarry’s Cars and Trucks and Things That Go. I found myself wondering what it would be like to live the way the families I worked for did – to have a washing machine, designer heels, a doorman, a bank account containing more than $50. Sometimes I played a little game in my head as I pushed my toddler charge around the city in my frayed winter coat and cheap boots: I imagined myself as her mother.Though these fantasies filled me with guilt, I couldn’t escape them. I was reminded of Marcy Dermansky’s Bad Marie, where the eponymous nanny effectively kidnaps the two-year-old daughter of her employer, but proceeds to take quite good care of her.I gobbled up books about nannies on my commute: from Lorrie Moore’s witty and touching A Gate at the Stairs to Leïla Slimani’s dark and propulsive Lullaby. I found myself drawn into things I would normally disregard. I binge-watched all six seasons of Gossip Girl. I read Primates of Park Avenue, and yes, even The Nanny Diaries. I was addicted to the outsider’s perspective.The year before I began working for this family, I had graduated from Columbia University with a master’s in creative writing. Those two short years had been some of the best of my life, but left me $100,000 in debt. So I started nannying, because it paid marginally better than most of the copywriting jobs I was now qualified for, and I thought it would be less taxing, leaving me free to focus on my writing at night. In actuality, I was exhausted after long, often 10-hour days with children, and I still struggled to put aside enough money for my repayment plan. My student loans were growing every month and writing was slow and painful. I worried that it had all been a horrible mistake: school, my confidence in my artistic abilities, my hopes for a life that was entirely unlike the one I’d been born into.“Life isn’t about money,” my dad told me. “Or your career. You’ll realise that when you have kids.”It was a strange thing for him to say. My dad worked six days a week for my whole childhood, rarely taking vacations. I didn’t know how to respond. Having kids seemed like a privilege reserved only for the very wealthy.“Nannying is good practice for when you have your own,” my employers said, but I was convinced that it was as close as I would ever get to motherhood. I was mourning what I assumed could never be mine from a very close distance, trying to understand it as if I were actually inside.The little girl I watched on the Upper East Side used to call me her Madeline. “I have a mommy, a daddy, and a Madeline,” she’d say whenever anyone asked about her family. Once, picking her up from preschool, she waved a pink-and-purple splotched paper at me, exclaiming, “It’s you! It’s a picture of you and you’re walking to pick me up and you have your nails painted and you’re the cutest Madeline in the whole wide world!”One day, the little girl’s mother had a morning off. She followed her daughter and me to a baby singalong that we had attended regularly, but never with her. As usual, I joined the other children on the rug in the centre of restaurant, holding the toddler’s hand as she danced to the guitar music while the mother stood back, unsure what to do. I glanced up and saw her stealthily wiping away tears. While I often felt out of place in the adult world, she must have felt the same way in this silly kid world where everyone sang and danced and drew.The last family I worked for had one son, older than the babies and preschoolers I was used to. For his ninth birthday his mother bought him a new bike. She’d arranged to meet us at the bike shop after work, but as usual she was held up. We sat waiting until the employees felt sorry for this little boy, who couldn’t stay still for excitement. “He can take it,” they said. “He can ride it around.”I watched as he pedalled down the street, looking gangly and uncertain on the bike, like a new baby deer. I watched him nervously brake for pedestrians, the wheels shaking a little, and my heart pounded when he approached the intersection, even though it wasn’t busy.By the time his mom arrived, over an hour late, he was an old hand on the thing. He was bored and ready to leave as she examined all the different features, he just said: “Yep.” She’d bought the bike, but missed the experience.Stephanie Land’s memoir Maid explains the strange intimacy of working in someone else’s home. “I became a witness … I almost felt like I had the opportunity to get to know my clients better than any of their relatives did,” she writes. “I’d learn what they ate for breakfast, what shows they watched, if they’d been sick and for how long. I’d see them, even if they weren’t home, by the imprints lefts in their beds and tissues on the nightstand.”I certainly knew the children I worked with better than their relatives. Sometimes, I felt I knew them better than their parents.The families I worked for were privileged. They had private-school educations, college tuitions paid outright, big apartments in safe neighbourhoods. I often resented them as I struggled to afford groceries and hoped that small holes and stains on my clothes would go unnoticed. It was no surprise that when I began to write, in bursts on weekends and during nap times, I wrote about envy and resentment. Though the characters in my novel are not based on any of my employers, they are based on the attitudes I saw, and the peculiar intimacy I experienced. Because I didn’t know what to do with my resentment, I allowed my protagonist to let hers take the lead. I think this is why we are all so fascinated by the lives of the rich: we love to nurture our resentment, lust and jealousy, to hold it close and live inside it.I spent seven years taking care of other people’s children. I still don’t know whether or not I’m destined for motherhood, but I miss the kids I worked with fiercely, though they no longer exist as I remember them. I saw the little girl from the Upper East Side twice after that job ended. The first time I met her and her mother at the politan Museum she rubbed my arm against her cheek with her usual ridiculous affection, and I went home and cried. (Clearly I had become attached.) The second time, in a restaurant two years ago, she was bigger, missing teeth, more reserved. She told me she could ride a two-wheeler all by herself and whined to her dad that she was ready to leave. Now, she probably barely remembers me.Children overturn our whole lives. We mourn them constantly as they grow, but for them, their early years stay fragmented and blurry. These parents’ memories of this period were also fragmented, lost forever when the nanny left. I’m not sure what do with all these memories of children that don’t belong to me. Though they don’t fit in my own life, I feel lucky to carry them around. This was my privilege. The parents got to have their children, but they also had to give them up.• Devotion by Madeline Stevens is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber on 15 August (£12.99)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6bff9be4023009db349555a0922cbf1f8fe575/692_58_3536_2121/master/3536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19b4d80b14e974ca9e8e0369e6b10a4f","title":"rough ideas reflections on music and more by stephen hough review","story":"The acclaimed musician muses on life, art and faithTo be a world-renowned concert pianist and composer would be more than enough for most of us. But Stephen Hough, who will mark the 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birth at the Proms on Friday by playing a concerto by her favourite composer, Mendelssohn, on her own piano, is a polymath. He paints so well that prestigious galleries stage exhibitions of his work and he has recently published a well-received novel, The Final Retreat.Perhaps, though, the two most impressive things about this renaissance man, to judge by Rough Ideas, are his modesty – the elegant jacket features not the standard “celeb” portrait, but him with his back to us, disguised in anonymous black coat and bowler hat – and a down-to-earth tone that enables him to tackle complex questions about art, faith, morals and life in an unpretentious, everyday way. So, when describing the life of a concert pianist in the series of short, thought-provoking and often amusing “jottings” that make up the book, he doesn’t bother with glamour, big names or his own “gift”, but instead answers the questions that those who have never been to the Proms might ask him.Why, for example, do classical music performers wear such old-fashioned, trussed-up clothes to perform in public? It is down to psychology, not elitism, he explains. “I really think I play better when I change into something special.” And why are classical audiences so disproportionately elderly? Not in Asia, he points out, where young adoring fans regard those who play Beethoven and Bach with the same near-hysteria as they do Justin Bieber.As in all the best memoirs, he isn’t afraid to tackle uncomfortable or inane questions: how often does he play wrong notes (more than you would think) and does he spend his days practising at home on some fabulous grand piano? No, he has a digital Yahama in his New York apartment, prioritising “floor space over a Steinway”.Elsewhere, he recounts being asked, as a gay man, if an audience member can tell if a pianist is gay by his or her playing style? Hough might be excused for dismissing the inquiry as insulting, but instead first takes the chance to damn the suggestion once made by the celebrated American concert pianist Vladimir Horowitz that there were three types in the ranks of his colleagues and rivals: Jewish, gay and bad. “I’ve known some that were all three,” Hough notes.Then he goes on, as is his style in the 200 or so pieces in the book, to pick away at the underlying issues in the question. Perhaps, he concedes, “there is an intensity, a verging towards the edge”, certainly among an older generation of gay musicians, who lived in times of “the fear of policemen waiting at the dressing-room door”.This is not, though, only a book for those wanting to go backstage in the classical music world. Hough offers thoughts on all sorts of things from architecture to picture restoration. Some of his most countercultural musings, however, come over religion. He is not, he says, adapting Graham Greene, “a Catholic pianist” but a pianist and a Catholic. “It has to do with the difference between God’s responsibility and ours in the creative process.” Where his own faith does, arguably, play a role in his work, he suggests, “is in the mental health that results from its vision of ultimate reality”.Some of these jottings have appeared before, in newspapers and magazines around the globe, but others are simply “notes” taken to fill “dead time” while on the road. It is one to dip into, but the sum seems greater than the parts, which, if you get to the end of Rough Ideas, you might conclude is also true of the man who wrote them.• Rough Ideas is published by Faber (£18.99).

Industry sources have confirmed that the grid’s frequency has fallen below 49.6Hz on three different occasions in recent months, the deepest falls seen on the UK grid since 2015. On Friday the blackout was triggered when the frequency slumped to 48.88Hz.In June, the frequency of the grid plummeted to within a whisker of National Grid’s legal limit of 49.5Hz after all three units of EDF Energy’s West Burton gas-fired power plant in Nottinghamshire tripped offline without warning.The unexpected outage triggered an emergency call for backup electricity supplies which stabilised the energy grid’s frequency before a blackout was triggered.In addition, the grid’s frequency fell to 49.55Hz on 9 May, and 49.58Hz of 11 July.A spokesman for National Grid said these events were “independent”. He added that there was “no trend or prediction of more frequency excursions”.“Over the past four years frequency has regularly fluctuated between the agreed limits, as part of the normal day-to-day operation of the electricity system,” he added.Steve Shine, chairman of Anesco, a battery company, said: “It would be easy for National Grid to write this incident off as a fluke event, but they have actually been aware of this potential issue for many years.”The growing concern over National Grid’s grip on the energy system has emerged as the energy regulator, Ofgem, issued an ultimatum to the system operator calling for an interim report on the blackouts by the end of the week ahead of a full technical report by early September.National Grid has managed to avoid wide scale blackouts by triggering last-minute contracts to help it stabilise the grid and avoid breaching the crucial 49.5Hz limit set by the regulator.It contracts energy suppliers to ramp up their output from generators and batteries to make up for an outage, and offers contracts to companies such as factories and supermarkets, which can temporarily cut their energy demand to help stabilise the frequency of the grid.But many of the companies tasked with supplying the “safety net services” – such as batteries and diesel farms, which are banks of small-scale generators – have warned that National Grid is not doing enough to safeguard the system against blackouts.The UK’s booming renewable energy output can make it more difficult for National Grid to balance the frequency of the grid, which was originally built to accommodate fossil fuel power plants, which generate more intensive energy.National Grid said it had embraced the UK’s renewable industry by developing “frequency response” tools – such as quick-fire back-up supplies of extra electricity – which should make it technically possible to run the energy system without any fossil fuels by 2025.Shine said: “What is needed is a greater volume of faster response services, which can be called into action when the frequency drops. This would have prevented the need to turn the power off.“It’s worrying that with just two generation sources dropping out of the supply mix, National Grid was still unable to deliver power to all areas, with no proper contingency plan in place,” he said.“It’s exactly this kind of scenario the UK needs to be prepared for – these recent events demonstrate how important it is to have more, faster response services available, which can be called into action when the frequency drops,” he said.Steven Meerman, the founder of battery firm Zenobe, called on National Grid to “update its old rules of thumb” to determine how many reserve services it kept on standby in the future.“It may be the energy system is changing faster than expected,” he said.John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, defended the grid’s response in a post on social media site LinkedIn entitled “there is never a good time for a power cut”.He said: “Contrary to some erroneous media reports, I am not on holiday – indeed, I’ve been at my desk all weekend.“As CEO of National Grid plc ultimately the buck stops with me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48a05fe275d4b2e71e4bc8244a2c7e4055f11e8b/0_0_2996_1798/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=358af170a6acca082bc91c1060a3e28a","title":"gold price six year high geopolitical crises uk unemployment us inflation business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as asset prices are hit by Argentina currency crash and Hong Kong protestsNervous investors are also piling into government bonds.This flood of money is driving prices higher, pushing down the rate of return on the debt.

Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Investors have a lot to worry about today, with a currency crisis in Argentina, mass demonstrations in Hong Kong, and plenty of signs that the global economy is slowing.Ilya Spivak, senior currency strategist with DailyFx, says traders are increasingly concerned that an economic downturn is looming.“It is a pretty straight forward case of risk aversion. Crisis in Argentina and political deterioration in Hong Kong underlying all of this, global growth is slowing.“Central banks can only do so much because a lot of them are at near record low interest rates. There is not a lot of ammunition to deploy as counter measures to the slowdown in global growth.” The peso also suffered a dramatic slump, to fresh record lows, as the markets faced the prospect of a new Argentinian debt crisis.Argentina and several other developing nations have come under growing pressure over their high levels of foreign currency debt. The US dollar has appreciated in value as the US Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates, which has made it more expensive for these countries to repay their dollar-denominated debts.Considered a market-friendly leader, Macri has used austerity measures in an effort to stem the country’s currency crisis, provoking an angry public response.Argentina relies on support from the International Monetary Fund through a $57bn (£47.2bn) loan intended to shore up the country’s ailing finances.Anxiety over the protests in Hong Kong has also risen, following the shutdown of its airport yesterday. Several world leaders are pushing for calm, amid fears that China could resort to military action to crush the pro-democracy movement.The latest UK unemployment report, due this morning, could show that Britain’s labour market is still managing Brexit uncertainty.The ZEW Institute’s survey of business confidence is due this morning, and could show that German investors are gloomier, due to trade war worries and the global slowdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4741b7e3daed14f27816c033b9c99f82e2687c/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=915e45cd21d4a423be2f4cd1e002d13d","title":"worlds largest urban farm to open on a paris rooftop","story":"With the 14,000m² farm set to open in the south-west of Paris early next year,  Cities gets a taste of what’s in storeIt’s a warm afternoon in late spring and before us rows of strawberry plants rustle in the breeze as the scent of fragrant herbs wafts across the air. Nearby, a bee buzzes lazily past. Contrary to appearances, however, we are not in an idyllic corner of the countryside but standing on the top of a six-storey building in the heart of the French capital.Welcome to the future of farming in Paris – where a whole host of rooftop plantations, such as this one on the edge of the Marais, have been springing up of late. Yet this thriving operation is just a drop in the ocean compared to its new sister site. When that one opens, in the spring of 2020, it will be the largest rooftop farm in the world.Currently under construction in the south-west of the city, this urban oasis will  approximately 14,000 sq metres (150695 sq feet) – also making it the largest urban farm in Europe. With the plan to grow more than 30 different plant species, the site will produce around 1,000kg of fruit and vegetables every day in high season. Tended by around 20 gardeners, they will also be using entirely organic methods.“The goal is to make the farm a globally-recognised model for sustainable production,” says Pascal Hardy, founder of Agripolis, the urban-farming company at the centre of the project. “We’ll be using quality products, grown in rhythm with nature’s cycles, all in the heart of Paris.”Located on the top of a major exhibition complex currently under redevelopment in the 15th arrondissement, the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, the farm will also have its own on-site restaurant and bar with capacity for around 300 people. Run by Paris’s renowned chain of rooftop venues, Le Perchoir, this aerial eatery will offer panoramic views over the capital – and, needless to say, the menu will feature seasonal produce grown on the site.“Our fresh produce will be used to feed the inhabitants across the south-west of the city – either directly, through veg-box schemes or via shops, hotels and canteens – thereby helping to reduce food miles,” Hardy says. “Furthermore, we won’t be using any pesticides or chemicals, so the farm will be a haven for bioersity.”The farm will also offer a range of services related to urban agriculture, including educational tours, team-building workshops and special events. Last but not least, there will be the opportunity for local residents to lease small vegetable plots of their own – in specially-devised wooden crates – helping to reconnect city-dwellers with their food source.“Our guiding principle with all our farms is to help foster environmental and economic resilience in tomorrow’s cities,” says Hardy, who expects the farm to start making a profit within its first year. “If we can create a model that is commercially viable, rather than having to rely on goodwill and subsidies, that will help urban farms to become sustainable in their own right.”While large-scale urban farming is nothing new in itself, with major sites in The Hague, Detroit and Shanghai, among others, this new flagship farm in Paris will be ground-breaking in several ways. Not only will it be the largest rooftop farm in the world but they will also be pioneering their own technique in aeroponic ‘vertical’ farming.Apart from not requiring pesticides, this method uses a closed water system and no soil – therefore minimising the risk of any pollutants. Furthermore, by supplying people right on the doorstep, the farm will have an exceptionally low carbon footprint.“Our vision is a city in which flat roofs and abandoned surfaces are covered with these new growing systems,” says Hardy. “Each will contribute directly to feeding urban residents who today represent the bulk of the world’s population.”For now at least, urban farming seems to be thriving here in all its forms. In fact, the City of Paris has committed to planting 100 hectares of vegetation across the capital by 2020, through its Parisculteurs project, with one third of this devoted to urban agriculture. For example, new for this year, a farming promenade is set to be created beneath the aerial métro line at Barbès.Among the other imaginative agricultural sites across the city is the eco-farm of La Recyclerie, installed along the old railway line at Porte de Clignancourt, and the organic mushroom operation, La Caverne, located in an underground car park at Porte de La Chapelle. Even the capital’s much-maligned Montparnasse Tower is rumoured to be getting its own growing space.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e6492fda32a0ca4553c9e6e0d458a07e0cc873b/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=567d144aa480acc9a2ad6868cf7a5b7b","title":"algae spirulina e3 blue majik health benefits","story":"Algae could be a way for vegans and vegetarians to get the right kinds of omega-3 fatty acids in their dietsThe next time someone asks where you get your protein, the answer could be the green stuff.While vegans and vegetarians steer clear of fish and shellfish, there’s another kind of seafood we need to talk about – and it could be the solution to a lot of problems.Algae, that green, slimy stuff you probably cringe at when you see it in a body of water, is being looked at by nutritionists and entrepreneurs in the food space as a potential godsend that’s been more or less untapped until late.Of course, the health food niche is no stranger to algae. If you have been to a smoothie shop anytime lately, you have probably seen spirulina, a strain of algae, on the menu. And those mermaid bowls or unicorn lattes you may have come across? They’re made with E3 Blue Majik, another strain of algae.As smoothie fans already know, these strains of algae boast impressive health cred. They’re packed with vitamins and antioxidants, and are more protein-dense than most vegetables. It could also be another way for vegans and vegetarians to get enough of the right kinds of omega-3 fatty acids in their diets.While nuts and seeds can be a good source of omega-3s, they only contain one of three main kinds, known as alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA. The two other kinds, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are primarily linked to all the hyped-up health benefits you have probably heard about omega-3s, from positive effects on mental health to inflammation. The human body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA, but not very effectively. Microalgae is the only known plant source of DHA and can help raise levels of EPA in the body. The reason fish tend to be so high in these two kinds of omega-3s is because they subsist on microalgae themselves. So, the plant-based answer to fish oil supplements might be simply eating what the fish eat.But the potential use of algae is much bigger than simply as an occasional supplement to a vegan diet. There are a few traits that make algae unique from other food sources. Algae can grow very quickly and in even the most inhospitable of environments. It doesn’t even require fresh water (hence its ability to grow in the ocean). Essentially, it’s a crop with minimal needs. All of this, combined with its remarkable nutrient density, is huge.Some startup companies have picked up on this and are working with it eagerly. The richness of algae, combined with its minimal resource requirements, makes it a promising and sustainable nutrition solution. Triton Algae Innovations and iWi are two companies currently exploring what is possible with algae. Triton grows its algae in labs and iWi farms theirs in the deserts of Texas and New Mexico. According to their website, iWi’s algae farms produce more “essential amino acids and vital nutrients per acre and gallon of water than traditional plant or animal based farming”, all without disrupting marine ecosystems. Both companies have an interest in sustainable nutrition and recognize algae as a potentially low-input, highly effective way to feed the world.But what they have in mind isn’t simply supplements and bitter green juices. What’s important to know about algae is that there are hundreds of thousands of strains of it, and only some smell and taste like the scummy green stuff you might have in mind. IWi is already selling supplements, but as their CEO, Miguel Calatayud, told CNN Business, the strain of algae that they farm is “virtually imperceptible” and could theoretically be used in a variety of foods without changing the flavor or scent.Triton, too, is experimenting with versatile uses for algae. One of their ventures is algae-derived heme, the complex that makes the Impossible Burger “bleed”. Their heme, however, doesn’t require genetic engineering, which means it can be labeled as GMO-free, according to Forbes. In that same interview, Triton’s CEO, Xun Wang, asserted that their algae can be used not just for techy meal replacements, but as an ingredient to make food-foods such as pasta and veggie burgers.It’s exciting that food tech startups are thinking seriously about not only how to sustainably solve global hunger, but how their solutions can be integrated into real life.

Downing Street gave every department 72 hours last week to present watertight crash-out plans and woe betide any whose ideas blow up later, Dominic Cummings menaced. “Task and finish units” will stress-test each one: tremble at the military-style management speak.Searching for what forms to fill, HMRC’s list of codes has been impossible for his complex products, where the quantity and original source of each ingredient needs a separate coding. “The paperwork is crazy,” he says. Each form has three pages, one needed for each of his 50 products with certificates of origin relating to ingredients from all over the world. “That’s what the single market did away with in 1994,” he says.Baker’s post-Brexit transaction costs include paying a carrier £100 a time to fill out the right forms, and a customs clearance agent to check and process duty paper work: qualified agents are in short supply. The company and each of his staff need security vetting to get exports through ports with less checking, requiring him to hire a security vetting consultant too. “I spoke to Revenue \u0026amp Customs for details but they said, ‘Look, we have had no indication what will be in place on 1 November.’” Baker is an experienced exporter, with an MBA from the London Business School, but the lack of information and the utter unpreparedness of government defeats him.Here’s what makes Calico Cottage’s story particularly alarming. Baker’s MP is Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, with an office just down the road. Baker asked Barclay to come round and examine the forms, to view the impossible task with insufficient information from HMRC for products like his. In mid-June Barclay sent round an assistant who spent more than two hours trying to puzzle out just one set of forms. The assistant couldn’t fathom the absent information but promised that Barclay would write a letter to HMRC for the missing details.For an insight into the current chaos, what came back two weeks later from HMRC to the secretary of state was a pro-forma letter as if written to any member of the public: “Dear Mr Barclay, Please accept our apologies for the delay in acknowledging your case. We aim to send you a substantive response as soon as possible. Yours sincerely …” HMRC is supposed to reply within a month, but the time is now very short – and how many thousands of other exporters are caught in this backlog?Baker wrote a shirty letter to Barclay, “as a loyal Tory voter all my life”. He invited him to “try filling out the following form which is the government’s ‘easy path to exporting to Norway’. It’s time consuming, HMRC is unhelpful and it costs a fortune to get the paperwork done. If this is your best model for Brexit try it yourself and then maybe even you and your Brexiters will think again.” Calico Cottage already exports to Norway: if that’s the government’s best model for a future EU free-trade agreement, it’s no substitute for the single market. “You have to fill out a paper form in triplicate with carbon copies, nothing online.”Brexit is already affecting Baker’s business as, short of warehousing, he tries to get all the Christmas orders out of the country and raw materials in before 31 October. Worse, prices are so unpredictable that suppliers such Tate \u0026amp Lyle refuse to sign a fixed contract for sugar, so are free to cancel at any time.Baker writes to his MP, “Voters like me find ourselves with no political home.” The frustration felt by so many in business erupts as his letter to me continues: “What amazes me is that the Brexit secretary and his team did not have an answer immediately … Given they’ve had three years, you can imagine that business owners such as myself are simply stunned at the incompetence of the politicians.”The great “ready-for-Brexit” sham paraded in Downing Street with all this “task and finish” talk may be designed to convince EU negotiators that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about no deal. But Brussels knows it’s all bravado.They too can hear the likes of Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, saying Calico Cottage’s experience is widespread. “The industry can never be ready,” says Wright. “With so many possible eventualities, it’s pinning jelly to the wall. There will be random shortages and unpredictable chaos. No commodity prices can be fixed. No one knows what haulage will cost, if queues or fear of visas make EU drivers refuse to come here. Some things will be fine, but some will be much worse than we think – the unknown unknowns.” When it turns out that the Brexit secretary and his assistants are as clueless as anyone else, all this macho “preparedness” looks absurdly shallow.How ready are the regions? Just one example: I was talking to Bristol’s dynamic elected mayor, Marvin Rees, about council budgets and cuts, when he spread his hands out in a kind of despair at the governmental neglect. “All I’ve been given is a grand total of £210,000 by Westminster for our Brexit preparations. How far do they think that will go when they say it should cover policing food riots, and compensating problems Brexit causes for business, transport or anything else?”The Times yesterday revealed that Cabinet Office plans include invoking the Civil Contingencies Act, with its almost unlimited emergency powers if Brexit threatens “serious damage”. Meanwhile, the Treasury seems to have spare time from its preparations to include Sajid Javid’s bizarre intention to mint new 50p coins. They will be embossed with the words “friendship with all nations”, a Ministry of Truth upside-down inversion to commemorate a no-deal Brexit with a no-£39bn crash-out that breaks friendship with our neighbours for years to come.

The rise of a racist, backward-looking, imperialistic and xenophobic political force has been conjured up by politicians and commentators alike, serving as a convenient whipping boy for Brexit chaos and other travails.English discontent certainly does lie at the root of much recent turmoil. In 2015 fears that the SNP would dominate a weak minority Labour government helped give David Cameron his surprise majority (John McDonnell’s courting of the SNP on the subject of a second independence vote suggests that Jeremy Corbyn may face the same “Scottish question” very soon). In 2016 the bulk of the leave vote was provided by voters more likely to emphasise their English rather than their British identity. And it was Conservatism’s appeal to working-class English voters with a similar profile that denied Labour a majority in 2017.If we are to understand the dynamics of our times then, we need to understand Englishness. But our research at the Centre for English Identity and Politics suggests that this is not the virulent nationalism of liberal nightmares. This nationalism has no political party or programme. Nor does it boast public intellectuals, cultural expressions or social institutions. Party activists knocking on doors rarely meet voters who express explicitly English political demands. The worst they might come across is a despairing “you’re not even allowed to say you are English any more”.Of course, not everyone who lives in England says they think of themselves as primarily English. The research found that while most citizens identify as both English and British, around a third prioritise their English identity (“I’m more English than British”). It is among this group, and those considering themselves “equally English and British”, that English interests are most strongly expressed.These are not, by and large, the people who hold power in England. They tend to live outside the cities and didn’t go to university. They include working-class voters important to Labour heartlands and those from the world of small business people who see themselves as embodying an ethos of hard work and public service, shaped in an era when banks had managers based in the high street rather than tower blocks in Canary Wharf. If both these groups are nostalgic, it is less for empire than for the place they once held at the centre of national life. Power in England now lies with the graduates, with those who lead corporate business and hold sway in culture and the arts, and in much of the media and academia. Influential positions are more likely to be held by the small minority who consider themselves “British not English” than by the self-identifying “English not British”.English-identifying voters are the least satisfied with their political representation and are unlikely to feel Westminster understands them. They want English laws made by English MPs, and many would like a parliament for England. These English identifiers resent the Barnett formula that gives deprived English regions less public spending per head than Scotland. Many see the NHS, university fees, social care and education – even the EU and immigration – as issues where the English interest is distinct from the UK as a whole. Far from being “Greater Britain” unionists they place as little store on the union as they do on the EU. Nine out of 10 think it is important that a political party stands up for English interests, but nearly half can’t identify one that does.Rather than being in thrall to Boris Johnson’s “Greater Britain” unionism, these citizens see both of England’s unions – the United Kingdom and the EU – as working against the interests of the particular England they see as excluded from power. This clash between the “establishment” and the English is about aspirations for power, representation and democracy that would be taken for granted in any other nation it’s neither necessarily regressive nor inherently rightwing. Indeed, it might well have formed the programme of a coherent and democratic political project. But without clear articulation or leadership, the English interest remains inchoate: a powerful yet volatile and unpredictable force. Certainly, if the union is to survive, English voters need to be convinced of its modern relevance just as much as voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The caricaturing of English nationalism as inherently reactionary and xenophobic has made the left and centre reluctant to hear what the English really want. It’s one reason why the People’s Vote campaign has found it so hard to really shift the dial on Europe despite the looming threat of no deal.Labour has failed to establish a commanding poll lead among the same voters despite competing with an unpopular and incompetent government. Even electoral reformers and democracy campaigners shy away from recognising English aspirations to enjoy the same level of democracy as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. No mainstream party is willing to speak directly to England.Many English-identifying voters want left-of-centre policies on the economy, public ownership, redistribution and the welfare state, but progressives’ reluctance to engage with their English agenda has left them in the hands of Brexiteers of one shade or another. Promises of more policing, NHS spending and immigration controls, as Brexit looms, suggest that Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings know which buttons to press. But the Brexiteer-English alliance is by no means secure. Leaving aside the difficulty of actually delivering, the inescapable logic of Brexit is to drive global market forces ever more deeply into the very communities desperate for protection from them.It’s late in the day, but “remain and reform” campaigners could acknowledge that England’s governance needs every bit as much reform as that of the EU. Labour could set out a vision for the English nation within the union. Perceptive Liberal Democrats should understand that the voters who abandoned them for the Tories in 2015 were driven by the English interest. If England’s democratic aspirations were recognised, the English could once again become part of the mainstream political conversation from which they have been excluded for too long. Misplaced fears of English nationalism could be put back in the box.• John Denham is a former Labour cabinet minister.

Universities are expecting this route, which opens on A-level results day next Thursday, to be even more popular this year.“Students are applying later and later every year,” says Helen Bower, assistant marketing director at Northumbria University. “They feel they have more choice so they don’t have to pick a university in the main cycle, they can wait to see what’s in clearing.”There are currently 30,000 courses with vacancies at a wide range of universities. This year, Cambridge is entering clearing for the first time, with places reserved for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.The admissions system is currently under review by the universities watchdog, the Office for Students, and by Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors. This follows unease over the process of using predicted grades, which are unreliable, and concerns about the pressure on students of having to reach target grades.The University and College Union, the lecturers’ trade union, has called for UK universities to adopt a post-qualifications admissions system, in line with most other countries. Under this system students would all apply to university after obtaining their grades, which would remove the incentive for universities to issue unconditional offers to persuade students to choose their institution.Matthew Cartwright, 20, is now in his second year of a degree course in computer science with AI at Northumbria University after opting to apply through clearing. He delayed his application because he could not decide what to study. “I didn’t want to take a course and think ‘oh no, this isn’t for me’, and having gone down the process to feel I’d have to stick to it,” he says.Cartwright liked the fact his options had been narrowed to four in clearing. “It was easier to make the decision. When we were doing the normal process there were so many options,” he says. “I got on a bus having never interacted with Northumbria uni before and got off the bus and they’d offered me the place. It was really simple.”While clearing was once a second chance for students who had missed their grades, many now use it to apply for the first time or because they’ve changed their mind, or they want to try their luck at a more prestigious university.To reflect the changing system, for the first time this year Ucas is allowing students to release themselves from their first-choice university, which allows them to shop around for a new institution.Alyssa Phillips, director of student recruitment at Staffordshire University, says: “The Ucas process is becoming much more flexible. It could mean more students changing their mind over the summer about their first choice university.”Some universities are seeing more late applications than others. Tony Flaherty, acting head of admissions at the University of Sheffield, a member of the Russell Group, says most applications arrive by the January deadline, with few first-time applications during clearing. “But we do see applicants submitting right up to the main cycle deadline in June,” he says.Robert McGowan, director of admissions and recruitment at Coventry University, says this reflects the changing profile of students looking to enter university. “What they’re asking for and demanding around flexibility and multiple intakes is very different from that traditional model, which is an undergraduate degree starting in September,” he says.“Universities really need to respond to a changing student, and exactly what the requirements and needs are of different groups. I think that will be one of the most significant things that changes over the next few years.”Coventry offers multiple start times across the year through its CU Coventry spin-off, and Davies says he has seen growing demand for these. He has also seen a growth in the number of students applying to the university direct, rather than through Ucas.“I don’t think the system is particularly good for students. We force specialism in our education system much earlier than in other countries and we also ask them to make a choice of uni 18 months before – that’s a long time for a 16- to 17-year-old in terms of their taste.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6492c872d5e54987263d23483f64f2637d7cc47b/0_213_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6848ed21f1f4908ea3cb24af88ff064e","title":"eton master wants pupils learn slow education mike grenier","story":"‘Slow education’ should replace the fact-crammed curriculum, argues Mike Grenier. But would this work in the state sector?You may not have heard of slow education but you probably know about the slow food movement, founded in Italy in 1986 and hugely popular worldwide. Slow food is the opposite of fast food: it promotes local ingredients and traditional cooking in place of processed ready meals and takeaways. After its success, along came slow fashion (buy clothes that last), slow TV (spend hours watching a boat drift down a river) and so on.To learn about slow education, I go to see Mike Grenier, a 49-year-old English teacher at Eton who founded a UK movement to promote it in 2012. “Slow education”, Grenier explains in his disappointingly modern and nondescript Eton classroom, “means developing lasting relationships between student and teacher and between student and learning”. It means more time for discussion, reflection and learning in depth, he says.“At the moment, we’re giving them packaged subject syllabuses and feeding them bite-sized dollops. It’s like a GP handing out pills. When you’ve taken them all and completed the course, you’ll be ‘better at’ whatever subject it is. Children from age four to at least 18 are required to prove themselves on a series of tests. It is a very impoverished view of what human beings are.”Slow education means cutting down on curriculum content. “The total sum of knowledge we now have on most subjects is enormous. Think of biology and the developments in genetics and neuroscience over the past 25 years, or physics and the increased understanding of quantum theory and how the universe works.“It’s all being crammed into syllabuses and it’s reached saturation point. Teachers say to students that ‘we have got to get through it’. The generation we are teaching now will live to at least 85 or 90. Why are we in such a hurry?”The idea of slow education was developed in the US early this century by Maurice Holt, who headed a pioneering comprehensive in Hertfordshire in the 1960s and later moved to the University of Colorado. He and Joe Harrison-Greaves, a musician and creative education consultant in the north-west, were among those who helped Grenier found the UK’s slow education movement.Holt argued that, just as it was “better to eat one portion of grilled halibut than three king-sized burgers”, so it was “better to examine in detail why Sir Thomas More chose martyrdom than to memorise the kings of England”. He was reacting to the worldwide growth in what he called “standards-driven education” and “test-shaped knowledge” – all of which has increased in recent years, thanks largely to Michael Gove’s curriculum and examination reforms.Does slow education mean returning to “learning by discovery”, “child-centred education” and other 1960s ideas? “No,” Grenier replies with a slight shudder. “Some of the fundamental tenets of slow education are conservative.”He argues that slow teaching should be underpinned by a version of the classical “trivium” described by Plato, comprising the basics of language, thought and analysis, and communication.“It’s not throwing everything up in the air and having a Woodstock-style let-it-all-hang-out. There are times when the most effective way to convey concepts and ideas is to use direct instruction and put things up on a whiteboard. Give students five, six, seven key concepts that they really need to know and then, because they can keep returning to these, it is easier for them to explore.”The stereotype of child-centred learning, he says, is that “you say to students: here’s Romeo and Juliet, tell me what you think of it”. It’s better, he says, first to introduce basic concepts of Shakespearian drama such as tragedy.So where does he stand on the “knowledge-rich” curriculum currently in vogue? “Knowledge-rich is clearly better than knowledge-poor but it is how the knowledge is used that is critical.” He wants his pupils to learn what a sonnet is, but also to explore how the form can be used effectively.How much slow education goes on at Eton? “We nail down the things we have to do, while also taking every opportunity to do things in new ways. Because we are a boarding school, students have a huge amount of additional time to do independent reading and show self-motivated love of a subject or skill.”Grenier, whose father was an investment manager and his mother a teacher, was a pupil at Eton before he went to Oxford. After leaving university he intended to take a course in teaching English as a foreign language but, “covering bases”, wrote to about 25 schools in England to tell them he was “keen on teaching”. Eton offered him a term as sabbatical cover – and there he still is 25 years later. To most of us, it may seem extraordinary – but not perhaps at Eton where, until the 1940s, pupils were taught almost exclusively by old Etonians.So is Grenier (whose son is also an Eton pupil) living in a bubble? Is slow education just a luxury, affordable only at schools where pupils have so much economic, social and cultural capital that they will succeed however you teach them?He says he is closely involved in Eton’s outreach programme and works in a variety of state schools in the Thames Valley.With Harrison-Greaves, he helped set up a network of schools that have explored introducing slow education in largely working-class Lancashire towns, such as Blackburn and Rochdale. He says that School 21, a free school opened in a deprived area of east London by Peter Hyman, a former Tony Blair aide, also embodies slow education ideas.But can he convince the mass of middle-class and aspirational working-class parents, desperate for their children to acquire certificates that will propel them into professional careers, of the merits of slow education?“More often than not,” Grenier replies, “parents want their children to be happy at school as well as to achieve. But we have a system that separates those things. It measures how well schools are doing in terms of numbers but it doesn’t take account of personal and social development.”Shouldn’t he set up a slow free school? “That’s not a plan at the moment. They’re not really free. To set one up, you’d have to tick so many boxes that you wouldn’t want to tick.”So how can slow education move forward? “We need a royal commission into our education system,” he says. I point out that royal commissions are out of fashion – none has been set up this century – mainly because they take so much time. “It should be a slow process. There’s lots that needs to be thought about: what we now know about child development and how the brain learns, children’s mental health, the effects of social media and so on.”I admire Grenier’s refusal to be rushed. The economist Milton Friedman started preaching the virtues of free markets in the 1950s governments finally embraced his ideas in the 1980s. I have a hunch Grenier’s time will eventually come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c084608a99fe387886c3ba5199bd74e7f09d506/0_15_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c7a22dcb56afcef037f3231e7276e60","title":"mike ashley newcastle united steve bruce sentiment results","story":"If success on the pitch should halt the protest movement in its tracks a couple more disjointed defeats under Steve Bruce may see it gain considerable tractionSunderland supporters used to joke that their closest rivals harboured such blind loyalty to Newcastle United that the mere presence of 11 empty black and white shirts stretched across the St James’ Park pitch would be sufficient to fill the stadium.Like a lot of quips it contained more than a grain of truth. Indeed the almost unconditional love many Newcastle fans feel for their team probably explains why wave upon wave of planned anti-ownership protests have foundered in recent years.Few would argue that Mike Ashley has been a model benefactor of the club but there is no consensus within a far from homogenous, heavily fractured fanbase as to how to respond.This reality reduced Sunday’s proposed boycott – aka “Empty for Ashley” – to a minor sub-plot rather than principal theme of the 1-0 home defeat by Arsenal.Although there were empty seats visible on all sides of the ground the official attendance for Steve Bruce’s first Premier League game since succeeding the much adored Rafael Benítez was 47,653. Considering that this figure included non-attending season-ticket holders the actual number of bottoms on seats was probably closer to 45,000.If that represents a significant drop on the 51,968 St James’ Park has averaged for the opening fixture in each of the past three seasons it still hardly constituted a disaster for Ashley and his public relations team.Even so, the owner’s spin doctors will have been grateful for the role Sunday’s torrential rain doubtless played in reducing a much-vaunted protest march to something of a damp squib.A collective of 10 of the club’s assorted fans’ groups, named “Empty for Ashley”, urged those boycotting the Arsenal fixture to congregate outside the city centre branch of the retail tycoon’s Sports Direct chain and walk the short distance to St James’, arriving shortly before kick-off.Only about 300 braved the elements but, outwardly at least, organisers remained undeterred, emphasising that around 10,000 season-ticket holders have failed to renew.“The action taken by the groups in our collective was the first demonstration in a new campaign with the objective of forcing Mike Ashley to find a genuine and ambitious buyer for Newcastle United Football Club,” said an Empty for Ashley spokesman.“Naturally, given our stance, we were hopeful of further numbers and are aware of the pull of a new season… but our fight against Mike Ashley isn’t going to be short and it isn’t going to be easy. We are committed to a long-term campaign which will not solely rely on fans boycotting games.“Our message to Mike Ashley remains the same: We are not going away. This will not blow over.”The collective’s problem is that, while other elements of the fanbase believe in offering Bruce the benefit of what remains considerable doubt, a sizeable number – possibly the silent majority – just want to enjoy a sociable afternoon out at the match. Many are strongly resistant to embroilment in club politics and argue that, if no one wants to buy the club, it is impossible for the owner to sell up. Perhaps tellingly there was barely a murmur of anti-Ashley sentiment inside the ground on Sunday.There was also a noticeable absence of “Wor Flags” adorning the Gallowgate End. Those giant banners, invariably celebrating Benítez, the team or inidual players, became a colourful part of the St James’ fabric in recent times. Now, though, 19 fans behind the initiative have cancelled season tickets, the flags are gone and the ground seems starkly bare without their artistry.Most players seem genuinely puzzled by such perceived militancy. The winger Matt Ritchie recently expressed his mystification at “unrealistic” anti-Ashley sentiments following a summer during which Newcastle invested £65m on five new signings.Almost everything now hinges on how Joelinton, the new £40m Brazilian winger, and company perform on the pitch and Bruce accepts that good results are imperative. If success should halt the protest movement in its tracks, a couple more disjointed defeats may see it gain considerable traction.“People’s money is hard-earned and they’re entitled to protest,” says Benítez’s successor. “My job’s to get the supporters back onside and enjoying watching their team.”Criticising Benítez represents a high-risk strategy at a juncture when Bruce desperately needs a point or three from away games at Norwich and Tottenham. Lose those two and Watford’s visit to Tyneside on 31 August really could prove a watershed moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7249d976cdd22d8cd0c55633702c1086737d15d/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eeaf568043bcf5df7a791aa874b9783","title":"joy despair and determination photographs from kibera","story":"Despite its poverty, Kibera is a vibrant place where people survive in testing conditions, both physical and mental.

And so, in April 2014, Clara spent two weeks on the Caribbean island with her parents and sister. Clara and her mother decided to stay on for a bit longer, moving out of the resort and into a guesthouse in a village. One day they visited the rainforest and met Nkosi, who had just started a new job as a tour guide there. He offered to take them into the forest but Clara’s mother didn’t want to do a tour. When they came out, Nkosi was still there, and Clara’s mother offered him a lift.What should have been a 20-minute drive turned into an all-day trip, with Nkosi showing them around the island. What did they talk about? “I would have just shown off about Tobago,” says Nkosi, with a laugh. Clara says: “I was feeling really shy. I think my mum was doing most of the talking.”They had all got on so well that Nkosi invited Clara and her mother for breakfast the next morning at the house he had built. “That, for me, was like, ‘Wow, this person’s really cool,’” says Clara. “I felt drawn to you then. My mum must have picked up on it because she was like, ‘Well, I’d better take her home now before I leave her here for ever.’”What did Clara like about him? “I wasn’t used to someone being so genuine,” she says. Boyfriends in the past “always had an image of themselves they wanted to portray and Nkosi seemed so open and honest, and it was quite disarming to meet such a pure heart. He wasn’t flirty at all, just warm to me and my mum.” Was he keen on Clara? He says he didn’t want to seem too forward, but “I thought, ‘I like this girl.’”The next day, Nkosi took them out on a boat trip with his friend. “I could feel that Nkosi, just the way he helped me on to the boat, was just a bit more tactile,” Clara remembers. He laughs. “What do you mean?” “You gave me your hand to help me on to the boat and I was like, ‘That’s not really necessary.’” Back at the harbour, they got a beer and sat down together – alone for the first time. “We had this nice talk about what we think about the world and what’s important to us,” says Clara. Nkosi says: “There was a connection.”He took Clara and her mother to the airport the following day, having exchanged numbers and email addresses but not sure if they would ever see each other again. “I didn’t worry,” says Nkosi. “Because I think everything is going to happen as it’s meant to.”For two years they talked on the phone, online and, towards the end of that period, by video calls. By then they were talking every day. Around then, says Clara, “I felt I loved him. I had a job and the means to come and see him again, so I booked a two-week holiday in Easter 2016.”When they met at the airport, she says, “It felt like being with family, it felt so comfortable straight away.” Nkosi says: “I was happy. We were in a position where you can’t analyse it. You just have to know it, and I knew. We had to make it happen.” Clara, he says, “inspires me to be the best I can be”. For her, Nkosi “really calms me down and grounds me because I’m someone who is quite analytical”.A few months later, Nkosi came to the UK so he could meet her family and friends. Clara waited at Gatwick for him. Hours passed. “Finally I got a call, about five or six hours after his plane landed, saying he was being detained and questioned.” She was interviewed a couple of times on the phone, sitting in an airport cafe. “Eventually they told me he was going to be sent back to Trinidad and Tobago, that they weren’t satisfied that he was coming here on a holiday to see his girlfriend.”Clara managed to find out where Nkosi was being held and, having missed the visiting hours, pleaded to be able to see him. She was told she had 15 minutes. “It was pretty bittersweet,” she says. The obstacles to being together, says Nkosi, “made me work harder – that became the inspiration”.Clara had qualified as a primary school teacher and for the next two years went to Tobago every school holiday. Nkosi tried again to come to the UK last year. This time, despite being questioned for several hours again, he was allowed to enter. “When he got through, I was almost delirious with happiness,” says Clara.They married this year in Tobago and are hoping to live in the UK together. “My mum sent Nkosi a picture of me working on our visa application,” says Clara, “and he texted her back saying, ‘Thanks for everything – especially that lift.’ It really did change both of our lives.”Want to share your story?

Here’s how parents can help them forge good habits and avoid creating lifelong insecuritiesJusna Begum lives near the South Bank in London with her four children, aged between one and 11. When a health visitor told her that her three-year-old girl was “on the chubby side”, Begum was surprised. “I didn’t think she was at all I had felt like my children weren’t eating enough.”She did, however, accept an invitation to join a six-week healthy parenting programme called Henry. Four weeks in, she has rebooted her family’s lifestyle, from making dinner times earlier to allow for more activity before bed to the food she prepares. Coming from an Asian background, says Begum, “There’s a lot of fatty food – we use a lot of oil and salt in curries.” Her children also loved drinking juice and snacking on crisps and chocolate after school. “I would just allow them,” she says, incredulously. “I thought it was normal.”In following her health visitor’s advice, however, Begum is in a minority. Just one-third of parents who are informed that their child is overweight or obese accept any help offered to them. Peymané Adab, a professor of chronic disease epidemiology and public health at the University of Birmingham, has been developing obesity prevention and management programmes for nearly 20 years, including studying parental responses. “There is definitely underrecognition of obesity,” she says. “Part of it is that we base our judgment on what’s normal, what’s around us, and as more children become obese and overweight you compare and say: ‘My child isn’t that overweight.’”While every child develops differently, healthy puppy fat generally ends with toddlerhood. The critical periods are around ages five and six and again around puberty when, says Adab, there is a tendency for weight gain and “perhaps we should be intervening more”.From age three and up, the main way parents are informed that their children are overweight is through the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), which registers children’s body mass index (BMI), once at four or five and again at 10 or 11. But BMI, a calculation based on weight and height, has limitations – for instance, it underestimates body fat in south Asian children (the demographic with the highest levels of childhood obesity) and overestimates it in black children.Another problem with the NCMP is there is no hard and fast procedure on informing parents of the result – it was set up to monitor trends, not as a screening strategy. “Some local authorities contact families of the children who were overweight and try to get them to engage in services some don’t do anything other than send a letter,” says Adab. “We don’t know what the best approach is.” Many simply don’t trust the figures. “Even colleagues here, working in academia, have said they’ve binned that letter because they think it’s rubbish.”Attempts have been made to word the notification differently, to little effect. “It’s an impenetrable problem,” says Adab – and it is exacerbated by our sugar-coated and deep-fried food culture. Her daughter was given chocolate by teachers as a reward. “I was part of our parent-teacher group and remember trying to speak up, saying maybe we shouldn’t have so many sweets,” she recalls. “All the parents thought I was from another planet.” At least in primary school, there is some control over what children eat the newfound autonomy of starting secondary school – and the sweet shops and fried chicken joints that come with it – poses the greatest challenge. Taste preferences are formed in early life: even exposure to flavours in the womb influences later habits, while sugar – separate to weight gain – conditions our brains to crave ever-bigger sweet fixes. “From a young age we can start getting children used to less sugar and less fat,” says Dr Angela Donin of the Population Health Research Institute at St George’s, University of London. “If they’re more used to snacking on savoury crackers that are high in oats or bran, and fruit and nuts, that will hopefully shape their preferences.”In 2017 Zoe Willman, who lives in Sheffield, sought help to persuade her two young sons, who have autism, to eat anything other than chicken nuggets and potato faces. “My eldest would eat cucumber, but apart from that vegetables were a no-go, and I was really worried they weren’t getting what they needed.” After a year working with a Henry volunteer, “Now we’re on fish,” she says proudly. Simple changes such as making shapes out of food and reward charts for trying something new have worked wonders. A healthier diet seems to have changed Willman’s children’s behaviour for the better – “There are more calm moments now” – and she herself has shed several stones.Begum was also pleasantly surprised by the Henry programme’s help in introducing healthy snacks to her family. She says it taught her simple presentation tactics, such as making carrot sticks, which are pleasing to children’s palates. “I peel and slice apples and then they’ll eat them. They love carrot and cucumber sticks with hummus now. Giving them a packet of crisps is easier than having to peel and cut fruit, but my kids really love it – and vegetables. It is expensive to buy, rather than the fatty stuff, so I’m careful not to waste it, freezing vegetable portions for dinners.”For parents who are anxious about their children becoming obese, the temptation can be to restrict certain foods and stress the terrible consequences of eating them – but this approach comes with its own concerns about instilling complexes. “It is a difficult balance, but I don’t think we should be saying there are taboo foods that we shouldn’t have,” says Adab. “That extreme has definitely been shown to lead to problems. It’s fine to have sweets on occasion but it should be no more than once a week. Every day we drink water rather than fizzy drinks.” But this isn’t easy, she says, and there needs to be a bigger buy-in from schools and parents. “If it became the norm it would be different.”Given the temptation-laden world we inhabit, will trying to limit access to unhealthy snacks encourage children to binge on them when they get the opportunity? Adab says there isn’t a scientific consensus as to whether restriction leads to weight gain. “Some studies do find an association, but we recently completed a study and found there isn’t an association when you adjust for children’s weight at the start. It could be that parents are restricting because their child is overweight, rather than the restricting causing the weight.”Zeroing in on weight and size, however, is psychologically unhelpful. Many professionals now emphasise positive, healthy living. “There is very little evidence that weight management programmes lead to unhealthy behaviours,” says Adab, “but there is always a concern that children will slip into eating disorders. It is still an area that is underresearched, but on the whole most weight management programmes don’t result in unhealthy behaviour if they are done properly.” The trend now is for weight management programmes to call themselves healthy lifestyle programmes, incorporating increased activity, prioritised sleep and limited time on devices into daily routines. “Providing hands-on activities rather than didactic stuff improves uptake and retention,” says Adab. Donin says that the Child Heart and Health Study in England (Chase) of about 5,000 children aged nine to 10 found lower screen time was linked with a lower fat mass index. Stephanie Byrne, a Henry practitioner who works in Lambeth, south London, says she tends not to mention weight at all: “It’s more about looking at the whole lifestyle of the family and getting people to identify where they want to make changes.” Rather than going on a diet, families might decide to buy a dining table. “We talk about eating slowly with other people, regular meals, portion size, not snacking all the time, turning the TV off, talking to children and giving them lots of praise and rewards. The evidence shows that is the best way to tackle childhood obesity and being overweight.”Begum has picked up ideas for how to make being healthy fun, from involving the children in cooking to creating a lucky-dip jar of activity options. “I’ve seen the difference in the kids,” she says. “I used to struggle to get them to bed but now they get tired. Before, I just didn’t think about healthiness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc513ddf63dc482a170e7949eda5821e4c1968c/713_0_5198_3119/master/5198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8da17cd799f39d23863ad4e0a6f800c","title":"himirror mini premium a pitiless oracle that points out every one of my wrinkles and spots","story":"This smart mirror is beautifully engineered and technically mesmerising, but there is such a thing as too much informationIn its favour, HiMirror is technically mesmerising. You line up your face to a virtual mask and it snaps a picture of you to analyse. The mirror is a mirror – unless you choose to magnify your face by x2 or a horrific x3, in which case it switches to a tablet-style camera in selfie mode. It displays weather and news snippets. (Deeply weird to be given the latest on Kashmir when obsessing over your pores.) You can connect to Spotify and watch beauty tutorials on YouTube.I’m a sucker for this kind of fluid futurism – and, unlike many overengineered devices, it works beautifully. When I turn it on, a purple sprite formed of bubbles winks at me, as if I’m taking a wee break from reality. By default, the sides of the mirror illuminate in clear white, although they turn warm and orange if you select the “Makeup studio” option. You can even try virtual makeup effects using augmented reality.The interface is stunning. My face, however, is not. It’s hard, being informed how rough you are on a daily basis, that you rate “poor” for dark spots but “average” for wrinkles. This information is tracked via projected graphs. The data is meant to indicate whether your skincare regime is working, which many people will love. As far as I’m concerned, the mirror might as well be shouting: “Come get some ham, Fatty Boom-Boom,” first thing in the morning.None of this is a healthy way for anyone to think of themselves. Body fat and basal metabolic rate may be interesting to gym bunnies, but should we care what our muscle mass, bone weight or water percentage is? You are not training for Tokyo 2020. You can like yourself without those numbers, or hate yourself when you are “winning”. It is impressive how the scale reads body composition from only an electric current, but frankly it is too much data. Staring at the chasm between yourself and your beauty ideals won’t bring you any closer to achieving them. If x3 magnification isn’t enough, how about x6, or x160? If you don’t like yourself, there will always be more ground to make up.From an engineering perspective, HiMirror is extraordinary. You could lose hours with it. Is such a use of time more important than nurturing your abilities and talents? Give me strength. And a bigger arse.The mirror and the scale both require a mains connection, which is just too much cable.

He was speaking after meeting Boris Johnson and senior British officials in London on Monday.“The ultimate end result is a comprehensive trade agreement covering all trading goods and services,” Bolton said. “But to get to that you could do it sector by sector, and you can do it in a modular fashion. In other words, you can carve out some areas where it might be possible to reach a bilateral agreement very quickly, very straightforwardly.”In other areas, such as financial services, he said deals may be more difficult to reach.It is the first time the US has suggested mini-deals being concluded before a comprehensive agreement, and underlines the US’s determination to help the UK as it faces the potential consequences of trade barriers being raised with the European Union, the UK’s largest export market. Previously, the US has resisted sectoral deals with the EU.Bolton, in a briefing with reporters, repeatedly underlined the US administration’s Eurosceptic tendencies by saying he and Trump were “leavers before there were leavers”. “If there was a no-deal Brexit, that would be a decision of the British government. We would support it enthusiastically,” he said.His chief message on the trip, Bolton continued, was to convey Trump’s desire to see a successful British exit from the EU, adding, “We are with you.” The Johnson-Trump relationship, he said, had “got off to a roaring start” with five phone calls since the British prime minister was elected leader of the Conservative party 18 days ago.“Britain’s success in successfully exiting the European Union will be a statement about democratic rule and constitutional government”, Bolton said. “That’s important for Britain. But it’s important for the United States, too. So we see a successful exit as being very much in our interest, and there’s no quid pro quo on any of these issues.”Asked to expand on this assessment, he continued: “The fashion in the European Union is when the people vote the wrong way from the way the elites want to go, is to make the peasants vote again and again until they get it right. There was a vote – everyone knew what the issues were. It is hard to imagine that anyone in this country did not know what was at stake. The result is the way it was. That’s democracy.”He brushed aside suggestions made by the US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that a no-deal Brexit might endanger the Good Friday agreement by reinstating a hard border on the island of Ireland. He said there was no threat to the agreement that he could see.Britain, he said, was “not going to crash out even if there is a no-deal exit. World Trade Organization rules apply. So we’ve got lots of agreements, bilateral and some multilateral within that context, that can be used as models.”On Iran and other security issues, such as Huawei’s involvement in 5G networks, Bolton said the message the US wanted to convey was that “the US government fully understands that in the next 80 days the UK government has a singular focus on the Brexit issue, so that we’re not pushing for anything on these broad and complex questions”.However, he claimed the UK had agreed to go back to stage one on Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, an assessment not shared later by British officials.Bolton also revealed that the UK had abandoned plans for a separate European maritime security force in the Gulf, saying the UK had instead recognised that it would have to come on board with Operation Sentinel, a US-led maritime force in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman.In his last act as foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt had proposed a separate EU force, but his successor, Dominic Raab, has said that such a force separate from US assets and surveillance abilities may not be viable.More broadly, Bolton saw a chance for the UK to leverage itself away from European foreign policy once it left the EU: “In terms of Britain’s overall policy, foreign policy, by definition, once it leaves the EU on 31 October, it won’t be bound by the requirement to seek the common foreign security policy with the European Union. It will be pursuing UK national interest as it sees them.An independent UK voice would lead to a stronger Nato, he predicted. “This is something that would be incredibly valuable for the United States and for the western alliance as a whole.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7020e7ebce0a943ddd01376adb62c14c9720dfb8/0_933_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89c12fd54eee41cc89249b1fcd23f87b","title":"brexit remain radicalisation fbpe peoples vote","story":"They hate Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. They no longer trust the BBC. They love civil servants, legal experts and James O’Brien. And now, consumed by the battle against Brexit, hardcore remainers are no longer the moderates. By  Daniel CohenOn 25 October 2017, a pensioner living in the Netherlands created a new hashtag. Hendrik Klaassens was concerned about the rise of Europe’s far right and wanted to bring campaigners together on Twitter. He settled on #FBPE: “Follow Back Pro EU”. Klaassens didn’t specifically have Britain in mind, but within a few days of his tweet, anti-Brexit Twitter accounts started using the hashtag. Before long, they were adding it to their usernames, so that it would appear whenever they tweeted. And in late November, when Mike Galsworthy, an influential anti-Brexit campaigner, posted a widely shared video on Twitter urging his followers to embrace it, #FBPE really took off. It wasn’t a memorable hashtag, but it didn’t need to be. The people consumed by their resistance to Brexit now had their own way to communicate, to find each other in the crowd.Today, Klaassens estimates that 15,000 people still use the hashtag, most of them in the UK. Their tweets have always see-sawed between defiance and distress, but in the weeks since Boris Johnson became prime minister – as they have become convinced that Britain is in the midst of a rightwing coup – they have grown increasingly despairing.The #FBPE brigade can appear locked in an arms race to out-remain each other. The descriptions that accompany their profiles are furnished with Brexiter slurs they’ve reappropriated (“remoaner”, “saboteur”), lists of the European countries they’ve lived in, and plainspoken declarations of devotion (“Remain – all the way through like a stick of rock”). They have come under attack from all sides: they are derided by Brexit supporters for being sore losers mocked, even by many who voted remain, for their fanaticism and earnestness. Yet for this online tribe, #FBPE is more than a badge of solidarity – it has given them an identity.#FBPE is just one sect in a wider movement that was born the day Britain voted to leave the EU. Before the referendum, it felt as if the only people who really cared about the EU were the ones who wanted to leave it. But a week after Britain voted out, tens of thousands of people massed in Parliament Square. Protesters waved the EU flag, draped themselves in it, painted it on their faces. All the affection for Europe that had been unvoiced during the referendum campaign was suddenly coming out in a rush. Belatedly, a new movement had been born: remainism.When they’re not soaking up anti-Brexit memes on Twitter, remainists can read The New European, a pro-EU newspaper, and anti-Brexit novels by Ali Smith and Jonathan Coe. They can listen to podcasts like My Parents Voted Brexit and Remainiacs, and if they’re looking for some remain-themed music, they can put on a recent album by The Matthew Herbert Brexit Big Band, which includes samples of Gibraltarian monkeys, a swimmer crossing the Channel and a Ford Fiesta being scrapped.Before the referendum, many of the people who have become remainists considered themselves immune to the passions of politics. They tended to hover around the centre ground and didn’t strongly identify with any party. They were used to being on the inside, to being listened to. But since 23 June 2016, remainists have found themselves out in the cold. “I just felt everything I believed in was stolen from me,” Angela Ramsall, a prominent anti-Brexit voice, better known on Twitter as @spaceangel1964, told me.Remainists feel embattled, ignored they lament what their country has become. They feel that the politicians who are meant to be on their side, and the media organisations that are meant to present facts impartially, have betrayed them. The system that had seemed to function, more or less, has broken down. Steve Deacon, a protester I met on a People’s Vote march earlier this year, was at Glastonbury festival when he heard the referendum result. Before then, he had felt that “the world had been marching forward, and things were getting better incrementally”. But since that day, it no longer seems that way to him.These are the kinds of sentiments that have come to be associated with leavers – the idea that the country had been going in the wrong direction, that it had become unrecognisable. But after the referendum, they were suddenly being voiced by remainists. “It was just so reminiscent of how radical-right voters would think,” says Rob Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester who has researched the rise of Ukip. “And it was remarkable how quickly that mindset descended.”And so these people, who once dismissed radicals as unreasonable, have themselves become radicalised. They used to pride themselves on their moderation now, spurred on by rage, they ide the world into enemies and allies. What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational – politics, in other words.Three years in, remainists can’t claim any concrete victories, but their fundamental demand – stopping Brexit – is now firmly in the mainstream. They have helped set the new conventional wisdom that Labour faces electoral wipeout if it doesn’t commit to a second referendum within the party, the pressure for holding another vote looks unstoppable. Only a few months ago, remainists seemed to be ascendant: each protest was bigger than the last, each delay to Brexit bought them more time. But Theresa May’s resignation changed that. Remainists faded into the background over the summer, as the Conservative leadership election sucked up all the oxygen. Now, with Johnson in No 10, the Brexiters are once again on the front foot. As 31 October approaches, the remainists are running out of time – and anything less than staying in Europe will devastate them. “It’s going to be like a bereavement for me,” says Helen Harris-Burland, a campaigner from the Chilterns.Remainists often describe Brexit as a distraction from the real problems Britain faces – austerity, inequality, a creaking NHS. Yet those problems existed long before the referendum, without galvanising most remainists in the way Brexit has. For many remainists, in fact, it can feel as if everything else is a distraction: what drives them on is their belief that Brexit is the battle of a lifetime. Through a bruising, often disillusioning process, they have acquired a better idea of what matters to them, and how to get it. “It’s been a fault of mine not being involved in politics before,” Harris-Burland says. “Since Brexit, I’ve learned a huge amount about how the country works – and it’s not very favourable.” Europe is the terrain on which this has all taken place. But for remainists, just like leavers, the argument is really about Britain: the country they thought they were living in, and the country they want it to be.Just as only a fraction of the people who supported Margaret Thatcher could be called Thatcherite, voting remain is not enough to make you a remainist. Remainists are the people who keep bringing the conversation back to Brexit. They point out that the referendum was only ever meant to be advisory, and insist that another one is just around the corner. They go on protests. They have strong opinions about Guy Verhofstadt and Sabine Weyand. They worry about chlorinated chicken. They have acquired detailed knowledge of electoral law and can list the leave campaign’s violations. They light up at any mention of the 2012 Olympics. They wonder what Orwell would have made of all this. They hang the EU flag in their windows. (There is a group of remainists who call themselves EU Flag Mafia, and perform stunts such as hanging dozens of flags from poles in the sea off Southend, like a gang of centrist situationists.)There are plenty of remainist groups: one, Wooferendum, even mobilises dogs against Brexit. The People’s Vote campaign is the behemoth at the heart of organised remainism – so much so that it has become a kind of byword for resistance to Brexit. Launched last year by Open Britain, the successor to the official remain campaign in 2016, it has brought different, sometimes overlapping remainist organisations together under one roof (literally: they share office space in Westminster’s Millbank Tower). There’s the People’s Vote brand itself, with its own local offshots and national marches the two big grassroots groups, Britain for Europe and the European Movement, which work side by side. And then there are the specialist organisations that now come under the People’s Vote umbrella – the likes of Our Future Our Choice (Ofoc) and Scientists for EU. If People’s Vote, with its Westminster ties and celebrity supporters, represents the pinnacle of slick establishment remainism, then Sodem (which stands for Stand of Defiance European Movement, and is pronounced “sod ’em”), is more homespun. Somewhere in the middle lies Led By Donkeys, a four-man band who have produced billboards featuring damning quotes from Brexiter politicians (Nigel Farage, May 2016: “in a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way”), earning them a place in the remainist pantheon.Ask a remainist what motivates them and they’ll talk about the EU: its role in maintaining peace, the importance of countries working together for prosperity. They will smile wistfully as they recount teenage trips to Europe or their time spent studying there. Older remainists will mention fathers who fought in the second world war, to stress that a peaceful, united Europe can never be taken for granted.There is an antagonistic strain in remainism that is just as important as this idealism. “Europeanism has always been more anti-Eurosceptic than pro-European,” says Robert Saunders, a historian at Queen Mary University of London. And what fuels remainists, three years into the Brexit process, is anger. They hate the people you’d expect them to hate: Johnson, Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg, “Andrea Loathsome”, to use one of their schoolboyish nicknames. They hate them for their lies, and their “cakeism”, the Johnsonian insistence that we really can have our cake and eat it: that Britain could leave the single market, say, without losing any of the benefits of being part of it. (One remainist podcast is called Cake Watch.)Most of all, remainists hate the way the Brexiters keep getting away with it. Remainists hated Theresa May by the end increasingly, they hate Jeremy Corbyn, too. Matt Kelly, the editor of The New European, considers this is a reasonable, pragmatic reaction to the failures of Britain’s ruling class. “If someone’s behaving in an extreme and bizarre manner then I think being pissed off is absolutely the appropriate response,” he says. “The anger comes in waves – and it’s pretty tsunami-esque at the moment.”Remainists tend to put their faith not in politicians, but in bureaucrats and civil servants. But they make an exception for those MPs, such as Dominic Grieve or Yvette Cooper (even though she doesn’t back a second referendum), who are willing to rebel against the party leadership or reach out to the opposite benches. Remainists wish these kinds of “grownups” – seemingly responsible, competent people, capable of putting the national interest above ambition and petty rivalries – could clean up the mess. This is a vision, however fanciful, of politics without politicking. Once the grownups come to the rescue, it suggests, the rest of us can retreat, safe in the knowledge that everything is under control. Remainists look enviously at Europe, longing for a leader of their own – a Merkel, a Macron, a Tusk – to deliver Britain from Brexit.At the People’s Vote protest in March, that craving was clear: among the protesters, I spotted a woman with a handwritten “En Marche!” sticker on her sleeve. The demonstration was the biggest show of support for remainism yet: somewhere between 300,000 and a million people marched through central London. That morning, I travelled to the protest from Bristol, one of the first places where the seeds of remainism sprouted, on a train chartered by local anti-Brexit groups, which they called “the People’s Vote Express”. One campaigner wandered through the carriages selling EU flags out of an Ikea bag.Halfway down the train, I started talking to Finbarr O’Halloran, a warm, rosy-cheeked man who was carrying a Led by Donkeys placard. His story was a textbook case of remainist radicalisation. “I’d been fairly apolitical throughout my life, just letting them get on with it as long as the country was run in a reasonably sensible manner,” he told me. “And it’s only the craziness of Brexit that’s made me mad.”O’Halloran was particularly infuriated by the misinformation, from politicians and the media, that he blamed for Brexit. “Forty years of lying have been done by the mainstream media to the British public,” he said. He wasn’t just thinking of the rightwing press. “Unfortunately, the BBC is no longer a source of truth for what’s going on in the country.” This has become a signature lament for remainists, who accuse the broadcaster of pro-Brexit bias. Andrew Adonis, a Labour peer and anti-Brexit campaigner, has been particularly critical of what he calls the “public disservice broadcaster”. He tweeted in May that “BBC News is so debased and biased, it should be replaced by a new independent news service”.Remainists are the kind of people who used to rely on the BBC, and defend it against attacks from the left and right. Now they feel it is just one more institution that has failed them. So they have to look elsewhere – and, in many cases, Twitter has filled that void. AC Grayling, a philosopher who has become one of the most outspoken remainists, described to me how he spends half an hour on Twitter first thing each morning, while on his exercise bike or treadmill. “Normally I start off quite slowly,” he said. But as he gets annoyed by the latest Brexit news, he finds himself going faster and faster.Echo chambers like Twitter are important to remainists, as they are to all recent political movements. By providing a space for like-minded souls to furiously agree with each other and rage at the other side’s idiocy, Twitter has helped remainists forge a common language, a shared story, an unmistakeably clear message – the things a political movement needs in order to take root. That effect is amplified by the rest of the remainist media: opening a copy of the New European provides that same feeling of being somewhere that is deliberately, happily, a bubble. In its first year, the paper readily baited leavers. More recently, though, it has dialled down the vitriol and settled into an exasperated sarcasm – a typical remainist mode.As you flick through the New European, you eventually leave Brexit behind for something that would have been unthinkable before 2016: the “Eurofile” section, a weekly paean to Europe and its glories. Another section makes for an equally odd sight in a British newspaper: pages of articles by academics, under the heading “Expertise”.Expertise matters to remainists. They don’t merely admire it – that admiration is an important part of how they define themselves. “A lot of remainers are proud to say that they embrace complexity,” says Ian Dunt, a journalist and presenter of Remainiacs. At the People’s Vote march, a man in a lab coat was handing out flyers on behalf of Scientists for EU: “for those who believe in experts,” he said.In their hunger for expertise, remainists have gravitated towards lawyers, such as David Allen Green and Jolyon Maugham, who have become celebrities in their corner of Twitter. Allen Green, a solicitor and legal commentator, plays the clear-eyed realist, slightly outside the fray Maugham, a tax barrister, windmill enthusiast and hardened critic of Jeremy Corbyn, is more of a troublemaker, like a maverick general lobbing grenades and plotting sorties. For remainists, lawyers – and trade experts such as Dmitry Grozoubinski and David Henig – are an antidote to “cakeism”: with their understanding of how the world really works, they are the ones best equipped to lay bare the madness of Brexit.Behind this solemn reverence for experts lies the belief, or at least the forlorn hope, that if leavers were only forced to confront the facts on Brexit, they would be overwhelmed by the weight of evidence. It’s a view reinforced by listening to James O’Brien’s radio show. Within the remainist ecosystem, O’Brien is simultaneously the star pupil, the most popular kid in class and the playground bully: remainists worship him for the way he shreds leavers’ arguments. As his impatience mounts, he drops his head in his hands – a pose that encapsulates how it feels to be a remainist today. “Can we all agree that it’s time to rename remain and leave?” he tweeted earlier this year. “I suggest right and wrong.”What is surprising, looking back at the months after the referendum defeat, is how muted the initial remainist response was, once the immediate outpouring of grief had passed. “The grassroots was virtually zero,” says Angela Ramsall. One group that did emerge shortly after the referendum, Bristol for Europe, set up a weekly stall to campaign for another vote. “We got a lot of hostility,” says Eileen Means, one of the group’s founders. “We were told we were like flat earthers.” Activists described to me the loneliness they felt in those early days. “So many people said to me after the advisory referendum, ‘give up, you lost. Get over it,’” says a spokesman, who asked not to be named, from EU Flag Mafia.At Westminster, too, few MPs gave remainism the time of day. Even politicians who are now ardent remainists were resistant. In December 2016, Chuka Umunna urged campaigners to stop calling for a second referendum. In the absence of leadership from MPs, figures from outside party politics filled the void. Most prominent was Gina Miller, the fund manager who argued that it would be illegal to invoke article 50 without a parliamentary vote, and launched a case that ended up in the high court. Miller signalled to remainists that it was no use sitting around, waiting for the grownups to show up: they would have to roll up their sleeves and get stuck in themselves. By addressing Brexit through the courts, like the other legal challenges that followed, Miller was aligning remainism with the pillars of stability and order: the constitution, the rule of law. It was a way of doing politics that could pose as unpolitical.When Theresa May called a snap general election in April 2017, “it felt like a particularly bleak moment,” says Jolyon Maugham. In response, he came up with the idea of launching Spring, a new party. “I wanted to find a way for those who felt like I did to stand together and say: ‘This is not who we are,’” he said. His plans were big. He would hold a 28-day festival at the football stadium in Maidenhead, May’s constituency. Each day would be dedicated to the national dress and cuisine of a different EU member state. For the finale, Maugham planned to announce that he was standing in Maidenhead as a Spring candidate.In the end, Maugham decided he didn’t have enough time to go ahead with it. But throughout 2017 it felt as if every remainist was toying with the idea of starting a party. In August, James Chapman, a former aide to George Osborne and David Davis, proposed setting up the Democrats. A couple of months later, Jeremy Cliffe, an Economist journalist, sounded out his Twitter followers to see if they were interested in a possible new anti-Brexit party. Emails of support flooded in: without really intending to, he had launched the Radicals, “pro-tech, pro-Europe, social-liberal” – and, ultimately, short-lived. While Chapman limited his platform to stopping Brexit, Cliffe’s was a fever dream of technocratic renewal: he wanted to scrap VAT, abolish the green belt and introduce Swedish-style social insurance.By then, remainism was starting to gather momentum. The election result had given remainists some hope: by depriving the Conservatives of a majority, it left May facing a trickier path to Brexit. And while younger remainists had been a quieter presence until this point, that started to change in October, when a 23-year-old activist arrived at a Brussels press conference dressed as a Brexit-fighting superhero.Madeleina Kay’s outfit – EU stars encircling the Superman symbol – caused such a stir that she was thrown out of the conference. But she now had a nickname, EU Supergirl, which stuck, even as she went on to dress up as Wonder Woman, a policewoman, and the Queen of Hearts, all in the service of stopping Brexit. Her cult following was boosted by the music videos she posted online: occupying the naffer edges of remainism, they include the kind of love songs or break-up ballads one might hear at an open-mic night, but addressed to the EU (“always thought you were the problem, now I see the problem was me”). Soon after Kay’s arrival on the scene, at the end of 2017, four campaigners in their 20s – among them Femi Oluwole, whose videos and tireless tweeting have made him a remainist celebrity – set up Our Future Our Choice to mobilise students and make the case for why Brexit will hurt young people.The young occupy a special place in the remainist psyche. On the People’s Vote march, there were protesters who put the names, or even photos, of their grandchildren on placards. At remain meetings I attended over recent months, many attendees backed giving a vote to 16- and 17-year-olds if another referendum takes place. And even elderly remainists delight in pointing out that as many as a million leave voters have died since 2016, believing that this tips the balance in remain’s favour.Of course, the young symbolise the future of the country – the very future that Brexit threatens. Yet behind these concerns for the future lies a more old-fashioned worldview. It’s leavers who are typically accused of indulging imperial nostalgia, by insisting that Brexit will revive Britain’s bygone greatness. But you can find that same nostalgia in remainists’ fear that leaving the EU will finish off whatever greatness remains. In the words of Michael Heseltine – who, as a Tory grandee who voted Lib Dem in the European elections, represents the Platonic form of a “grownup” – Brexit would mean Britain “voluntarily stepping down from its position of world pre-eminence”.Some of this same nostalgia seems to inform the familiar lament about how far Britain has fallen, reducing itself to a laughing stock on the world stage. But the real embarrassment for remainists is not how the rest of the world views Britain – it is seeing their own country ruled by politicians who have parted ways with reason and decency. They shudder at every new degradation Britain faces, while also accepting it as the inevitable fulfillment of their warnings. The Irish journalist Fintan O’Toole has described Brexit as a masochistic project but, as leavers are fond of pointing out, remainists have a masochistic streak of their own. The most zealous remainists give the impression of relishing each morsel of bad news – growth slowing, a car plant closing – as if willing on the damage that confirms their worst fears. Like revolutionaries striving to heighten the contradictions, they believe that only then will leave voters see the error of their ways, and the politicians who deceived them get what they deserve.As much as remainists worry about the future, they see themselves on the right side of history. “It is inevitable that pro-EU attitudes will grow,” says AC Grayling. “If we were to leave, it wouldn’t be for very long in historical terms. Maybe five or 10 years.” That makes Brexit a blip – a glitch in the system, destined to be righted. When I asked remainists if they were worried about what might happen if Brexit were stopped – how leave voters could react to the result of the referendum being rejected – no one seemed too concerned. Much as remainists claim to champion complexity, their own optimism is not so different from the kind currently coming out of No 10: it is as if the past three years could be magicked away, Brexit and its supporters bypassed, at little enduring cost.For much of his career, Andrew Adonis was the kind of politician who felt more comfortable in the background. As a peer, he was even able to become a Labour minister without being elected. But by the end of 2017, he felt that no one was really making the case against Brexit. “Just as the country was in danger of literally going over the cliff, I felt it was my duty to weigh in,” he told me, over coffee at Millbank House in Westminster. So Adonis threw himself into campaigning. (Earlier this year, when he ran unsuccessfully for the European parliament, he squandered some of his remainist capital by briefly backing Labour’s plans to carry out Brexit.)On a bright Thursday evening in April, I saw Adonis speak at a Lambeth for Europe event in south London. Lambeth voted remain by a bigger margin than any other area in the UK, and Adonis drew a rapt crowd of a hundred-odd people. Wearing a brown suit and a turquoise shirt, Adonis resembled a 1970s university lecturer (he worked briefly as an academic), and there was something teacherly in the way he addressed the audience. Amid figures on Britain’s trade with the EU, and references to the intricacies of the withdrawal agreement, he explained why all proposals – apart from a second referendum – were, ultimately, doomed.Adonis defines remainism as a revolt of the middle class – and that is why he believes that, in the end, Brexit won’t happen. “The English middle class, deeply alarmed, will be heard and will win,” he told me. “That’s my whole experience of politics.” Remainism is seen, not entirely unfairly, as an unusually middle-class protest movement, but remainists have attempted to flip that perception by branding Brexiters, or at least the politicians who speak on their behalf, as the true elite. Tweeting about Nigel Farage in March, Alastair Campbell wrote, “Dulwich College. City trader. MEP. Billionaire friends with private jets.”In a moment of crowd-pleasing populism during his talk, Adonis proposed banning anyone who had been to Eton from holding public office. Coming from a man who sits in the House of Lords, this rhetoric can feel a little hollow, but it certainly played well with the audience. Adonis peppered his talk with references to “Nigel” and “Jacob”, knowing that merely mentioning those names was enough to fire up his crowd. “Whenever Boris or Jacob Rees-Mogg make one of their speeches, we get another flush of people,” Eileen Means, from Bristol for Europe, told me.Brexit is not the kind of fight that can end in a tie or a truce. Whatever happens, at least one side will believe they have lost. And for remainists, any kind of Brexit will feel like defeat. To win, before the clock ticks down, they have to complete the project they began three years ago: convincing enough of the country that Brexit isn’t simply undesirable, but that it can – and should – be stopped.They have already travelled quite a distance. The rise in support for a second referendum could never have happened without the work of campaigners and groups like People’s Vote. Merely repeating their message isn’t what got them there – what matters is the way they have shouted it. A bolshier form of remainism now prevails, as if remainists are trying to match the stridency of the Brexiters. The rallying cry “Bollocks to Brexit” is the kind of statement one might expect to hear, in tone if not content, from someone like Farage. Until recently, it would have been hard to imagine the Liberal Democrats co-opting it as their campaign slogan, as they did in the recent European elections. (Compare this to their almost parodically bland slogan at the last general election: “Change Britain’s Future”.)And it has worked, up to a point. The Lib Dems spent years fruitlessly opposing Brexit, while they languished in the polls. That started to change when they dressed themselves in the clothes of remainism, borrowing its belligerence and fire. They came second in the European election – top in London – and seized the Conservative seat of Brecon and Radnorshire in a byelection earlier this month. And they have benefited, at the same time, from the discrediting of Labour’s Brexit strategy – another remainist victory.But remainists worry that, as long as their votes are split across several parties, their influence will be limited. The Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru are now trying to remedy that. Over the next month, they plan to settle on 100 joint anti-Brexit candidates who will run at the next general election. Yet if this suggests they’re willing to put Brexit above party loyalties, there’s a limit to how far they will go. The Lib Dems’ refusal to countenance joining any kind of caretaker government with Corbyn at the helm – even if that could rule out a no-deal Brexit – confirms that remainists are continuing to do politics under the guise of putting politics aside to serve the national interest.And there are ides within the movement, even on the question that defines it. According to emails leaked to BuzzFeed in July, People’s Vote campaigners are at odds over the group’s stance on Brexit: it demands a second referendum but refuses, for now, to explicitly back remain, however obvious its allegiances may be. Then there are the biggest obstacles of all: the new prime minister, and a Labour leader who still won’t bow to remainist demands.Where will remainism’s energy go, once Brexit happens, or is somehow thwarted? Rob Ford draws a parallel with Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014. “You had a similarly intense mobilisation, a similarly intense tribal identification with both sides.” Almost five years later, he says, “people are still much more attached to the independence cause on either side than they were before the referendum happened. But the volume dial has gradually got turned down in terms of how important it is.”For remainists, it will be a test of just how radicalised they have become. Three years of resisting Brexit has taught them a fundamental lesson about politics. They now see that they are just another interest group – and if they want something, they have to fight for it themselves. That has been a painful realisation for remainists, but an invigorating one. “I’ve found a sense of moral purpose,” says Jolyon Maugham. “I think a lot of people are experiencing a similar epiphany. We are learning that there are no grownups in the room.” In different parts of the country, I met remainists who had been apolitical before 2016, and were now planning to run for one of the anti-Brexit parties – the Lib Dems, Change UK, Renew.The question, though, is whether any other cause will stir the same passion in remainists as their current struggle. This is the crux of the leftwing critique of remainism: the charge that remainists are fixated with Brexit at the expense of everything else – and that rather than seeking to transform the country for the better, they just want to turn back the clock to the time before the referendum when they didn’t have to think about politics because it didn’t impinge upon their privileged bubble. Remainists see it differently. Unless Brexit is stopped and economic calamity averted, they argue, Britain won’t have the money to pay for policies like ending austerity. “We care about those things,” Cynthia Potter, an American campaigner who lives in Cardiff, told me. “But Brexit comes first.”For now, the most committed of remainists have put their lives on hold. Madeleina Kay dropped out of university to focus on campaigning. Maugham has given up most of his legal work. Again and again, campaigners have thought that crunch time was approaching, only for the process to keep dragging on. Brexit hasn’t simply consumed its opponents it has left them in a purgatorial state, unsure of when they will finally be free.In June, almost three years to the day after the referendum, I went to Westminster for the daily protest by Sodem. The group began in September 2017, when Steve Bray, a rare-coins dealer from Port Talbot, came to London. “I only thought I’d be here for a couple of weeks, couple of months,” he told me, wearing his trademark blue-and-yellow top hat with “Stop Brexit” written across it. He started standing opposite parliament all day, waving a two-sided flag: the EU on one side, the union jack on the other. He snuck into the background of news broadcasts from Westminster, holding placards or shouting slogans. Before long, he became a kind of cult figure, and a hero to his fellow remainists: a one-man symbol of their collective defiance.As Bray’s fame grew, people started joining him. One regular protester admitted to me that when she first saw him, she thought he was mad. But she kept coming back: it was a way to feel like she was doing something, to feel less alone. When I visited Sodem, there was a small group of protesters – mostly female, mostly middle-aged. In the kind of scene that has somehow become normal in Brexit Britain, they stand, facing the traffic, while someone periodically roars “Stop Brexit!” Elspeth Williams, who runs the group’s social media, is one of the people who shows up every day. Like other Sodem protesters I spoke to, she came across as gentle, with a hint of steel. She has lived in Spain for 25 years, but since last December she has been back in the UK so she can be part of the protest. She stays nearby in a flat that she rents with Bray and a few other protesters until recently, they were on the same street as Jacob Rees-Mogg.I wondered what would happen to these people after Brexit. How might it feel to give so much of yourself to something and still come out on the losing side? Duncan Hodgkins, an army veteran and antiques dealer who now protests with Sodem full time, wasn’t optimistic: he told me he expected Brexit to go ahead. But he didn’t seem disillusioned. He glowed as he described how campaigning against it, his first taste of politics, had enriched him. “I’m so much more than the person I was before I started this,” he said. “I’ve found abilities within me that I didn’t realise I had: being able to communicate with different people, to have an actual opinion and not be scared to give it out.”At the end of the afternoon, Sodem gathered around the gate to parliament for their daily “shout”. Bray yelled into a metal loudhailer, leading them through a series of slogans – “Bollocks to Boris” and “Stop Brexit”. Afterwards, a protester told me that when she had drawn tarot cards, they showed that Britain would stay in the EU. But it wasn’t certain. “I did that six months ago,” she said. “Energies can change.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7d3a86502e520b47bc6255d1b9602695ca9e75/0_296_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bd1646c6030b8314de22008031b26f8","title":"allotments share your pictures and stories","story":"Glut of green beans or a cornucopia of courgettes?

It’s going to take time.”Now pain-free after hip surgery, the Scot started slowly as he struggled with his first serve and had to contend with Gasquet’s determination to test his mobility at every opportunity.Murray showed flashes of his best form as he warmed to his task but his lack of match fitness and Gasquet’s frequent use of the drop shot meant he was always fighting a losing battle.Gasquet said: “You could see that it was not the Murray of before but that’s to be expected.”Murray last played singles at a grand slam event in Melbourne in January, when he lost in the first round, and he will limit himself to the doubles and mixed doubles at Flushing Meadows. He may now play singles next week at the Winston-Salem tournament.The twice Wimbledon and Olympic champion, who feared in January that his career could be over, surrendered his service in the opening game and came within a point of a 3-0 deficit before rallying. However, Gasquet unsettled him with more drop shots before taking the first set.The second started in much the same fashion with the Frenchman establishing a 2-0 lead. Murray repeatedly threatened to break while holding his own service with increasing confidence. He hit his first groundstroke winner, a crosscourt forehand, in the fourth game of the second set. But Gasquet, who himself missed four months of 2019 after undergoing groin surgery in January, maintained control and sealed the second set.Greg Rusedski said the first-round match was “very positive” for Murray. “He will have learned a lot from a physical point of view and how he recovers overnight,” Rusedski tweeted.Murray’s painful exit from the Australian Open had him thinking his career might be over. The three-times major champion underwent a second hip surgery in January, receiving metal implants that helped eliminate the pain that had hobbled him.He played doubles in several tournaments, including Wimbledon with Serena Williams and Pierre-Hugues Herbert, before trying singles at Cincinnati, where he is a two-times title winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff13af2251abfd00e4110a87a90b10b9c37bea4/0_82_2944_1767/master/2944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=794b8eb676e45fc687c6b2fbeb47b25a","title":"jofra archer england australia ashes second test cricket","story":"Is Jofra Archer ready to go the distance in Test cricket?It was the question posed by Justin Langer, Australia’s head coach, before the fast bowler’s much-anticipated debut at Lord’s this week. There is a theory that stamina could be a shortcoming.But when the idea was put to England’s expected replacement for Jimmy Anderson the answer was in keeping with a cricketer who is softly spoken off the field and yet supremely confident with it.“I’m probably more ready than I’ve ever been,” said Archer, who earlier that morning had tweeted his hope of claiming a spot on the honours boards at Lord’s. “I don’t think Justin Langer has seen me play first-class cricket. I usually bowl 40 overs every game. I think he has another thing coming.”Archer was England’s leading wicket-taker in their victorious World Cup campaign with 20 victims but he is coming into a Test side that is 1-0 down to Australia. He is rightto point to his back catalogue of four-day cricket. Televised short-form tournaments propelled him to global superstardom but it is the longer stuff which he claims to prefer.Since his first-class debut for Sussex in 2016 his workloads have been significant too. That said, despite averaging 24 with the Duke ball, Archer has played only one fixture with it in the last 11 months – the 2nd XI match last week in which he took seven wickets but, more importantly, proved his fitness after a recent side injury by sending down 31 overs across two days.This is perhaps why Archer, back at the ground where his super over helped secure the World Cup, has warned England supporters not to “expect miracles” from him this week. Replacing Anderson, the country’s most prolific Test bowler, would represent a fair old challenge for any newcomer even if, in the case of Archer, his debut is probably the most talked up since Kevin Pietersen’s at Lord’s in 2005, if not Graeme Hick’s 14 years before that.While the pitch looked green but dry two days out, the ground’s topography should suit him. As well as the much-discussed 90mph-plus speeds he generates, bowling wicket-to-wicket is one of Archer’s great attributes. And having claimed eight wickets for Sussex against Middlesex here last season he believes the famous slope is a significant factor for him.“I personally believe in Test cricket you get a lot more opportunities to redeem yourself. In 50-over cricket if you don’t have a good 10 overs, that’s it – you’ve got to wait till the next game. But you have ample chances to do it in a red-ball game.”Another difference concerns the tighter regulations on short balls in limited-overs cricket. Archer’s deceptive bouncer struck three batsmen on the head during the World Cup and, while still restricted to two per over in Test cricket, there is more leeway as regards wides.“Pace makes batters do funny things. It may make him play a shot he is not accustomed to. He may be a bit late on the ball so, if you have the batter overthinking, then you are in a good place.”England have certainly been thinking about how best to remove Steve Smith and, while they are yet to decide whether Sam Curran replaces Joe Denly – a move that would give Joe Root six bowlers but put greater pressure on the top order – it is hoped Jack Leach can pick the lock.Asked about Smith’s average of 34 against slow-left armers – 29 runs less than his Test average but slightly amplified by turning pitches in the subcontinent – Langer replied: “I don’t buy into it. He’s got this incredible ability to solve problems, I’m sure he’ll be thinking a lot about how he’s going to play all the new bowlers who are coming in.”While Australia trained during a dry morning, England were forced indoors by rain and Simon Harmer, the Essex off-spinner who plays on a Kolpak deal, made a guest appearance to help replicate Nathan Lyon. Smith’s wicket may be the most pressing issue for Root but it is not the only one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2716124dda663057a574bd108a334c7ce03ec7/452_641_2515_1509/master/2515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a7a7246c329ebc144eb7a8f5fe347a","title":"suzann pettersen solheim cup wildcard europe golf","story":"The rocky alliance between Suzann Pettersen and the Solheim Cup continues after the Norwegian was surprisingly handed a wildcard pick for the European team seeking to win back the trophy next month at Gleneagles.Pettersen has played only two events in almost two years due to the birth of her son. She missed the cut at the Scottish Open last weekend days later Catriona Matthew, Europe’s captain, has raised eyebrows by confirming she will hand the 38-year-old a ninth Solheim Cup appearance.This event and Pettersen have produced multiple headlines. In 2017 she was a late withdrawal after sustaining a back injury. Two years earlier Pettersen caused outrage with her role in a rules incident involving Alison Lee, her American opponent. Now, in a move that will have been noted in the United States, Pettersen is back in the Solheim spotlight.“The Solheim is so intense,” Pettersen said, reflecting on 2015. “It is a lot of pressure. You are right there in the heat of the battle. I think what happened in Germany was very unfortunate at the time. I think everyone has learned from it. Everyone has moved on. Hopefully it will not bubble up again.“In the heat of the moment my head wasn’t thinking clear enough to be able to change what happened there and then. I don’t think anyone else was either until they had some time away to be able to think more of it.“I don’t want any other players to go through what I ended up having to go through. But if there was one player who could probably take that load, I was probably the one on the European team. It was tough but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.”Pettersen smiled in response to the suggestion she is under increased pressure as a pick from the lowly position of 644th in the world. “Bring it on,” she said. “I can’t wait to get started.“Sometimes you don’t always have to go off the books you don’t have to go off the ranks.

But as a player out there on the course, especially for some of the younger players, they really look up to her and respect her.“To them it has been a great boost to see her wanting to come back on the team.”Bronte Law, Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Céline Boutier were Matthew’s other additions to the team.

Billed as the biggest arts festival in the world, the fringe offers thousands of different shows with plenty to cater for almost any taste you might imagine. Almost.For the last two years grassroots organisation Fringe of Colour has been on a mission to highlight and rectify the lack of BAME presence at the festival. Last year Layton Williams, an actor who has appeared on BBC Three in Bad Education and on the West End as Billy Elliot, accused security staff at the Assembly George Square venue of racial profiling after they alleged that he looked like a man who had jumped the fence two weeks before. The venue eventually apologised, but Williams’ experience is not unique.Not every experience is negative, and of course the fringe also offers unimaginable opportunity for directors, producers and performers, with many considering it the highlight of their creative year. Those in charge of the fringe are also making an effort to increase inclusivity, having designated ersity as one of the key strands of this year’s fringe central programme. But is enough being done to welcome people of all backgrounds to the fringe? We asked comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences.I haven’t had any proper negative experiences unless you count the occasional hostile reaction from drunk men when I tell them I’m not Romesh Ranganathan. When I told another BAME friend that I hadn’t experienced much racism in Edinburgh, they said “It’s because you get to be Nish”. I’ve been able to exist outside of the usual micro-aggressions because of the status I have at the fringe.I have heard more stories about racism in Edinburgh from other performers over the last couple years, but I suspect that is a symptom of a wider national problem with people becoming more comfortably racist. There’s also this weird strain of liberal racism where people believe they’re so liberal that they couldn’t possibly be racist – at another festival I had a woman describe me as “a little bit namaste”. Edinburgh changed my life and I owe my career to it so I really want to give more people from backgrounds like mine the sense that this is something they can do too. Nish Kumar, comedianI’ve heard other BAME acts talk about how their friends don’t even come up to Edinburgh because of the associated costs. The fringe is definitely skewed towards wealthier people who might not be from a BAME background, and so you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re doing something for a more varied audience. Personally I haven’t experienced any racism at the fringe, but I still think what Fringe of Colour is doing is fantastic – if only there was a way they could eliminate the transport and hotel costs since they’re likely the biggest inhibitor stopping young BAME people from going up to the fringe. Arnab ChandaOur poetry collective, 4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE, did a five-day run at the fringe with three sell-out shows. We felt that it was important to create a space for performers of colour. Both our white and non-white audience members felt empowered by the stories and voices on our stage and we even had one white member of the audience tell us that the show had helped her reflect on her privilege. We received a great response from our audiences who said there weren’t any shows like ours. We were there to creatively challenge the audience through our collective vulnerability of what it’s like to be “othered” – and people were welcoming of the space we created. 4 Brown Girls Who Write, performers and poets, LondonI love the fringe and want to keep going every year, but sometimes the subtle ignorance can get tiring. As a hijab-wearing Muslim, people handing out flyers for shows don’t approach me but instead give flyers to my white, non-hijab wearing friends. At comedy shows I’ve gotten used to comedians never trying to begin a conversation with me, no matter how many times I sit in the front row, and at bars I find people staring at me before quickly looking away. These things may be small but they all add up to make it clear that the fringe is not meant for people who look like me. Faaiza, 33, LondonI have a love-hate relationship with the fringe. Having worked on it 14 years out of the past 29, I love that the best emerging acts come to Edinburgh in August and I get the artistic nourishment that isn’t there the rest of the year. However, as an Indian woman and a creative, I hate how invisible BAME work and artists are made, through lack of access to high-profile showcases, press coverage and reviews. It can be a breeze for some BAME people but for most of us it’s not about our art, it’s about physical and mental stamina. To succeed you have to be a fighter. Annie George, performer, EdinburghI’ve been attending the fringe for almost 13 years and have never felt out of place as an ethnic minority. Perhaps more widening access schemes and better space and accommodation would help ease this problem. I think it would be more effective to reduce prices of concession tickets overall and have cheaper tickets for Edinburgh locals. It’s expensive to put on a show and this is off-putting for poorer people generally. Anonymous, EdinburghAs brilliant as the fringe is, I did look around when I was there and think: “why is this not more erse?” And I didn’t have an answer to that. With more ersity you get more interesting stories, which is especially important for art forms like theatre. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that a lack of ersity is a problem for the fringe. I do believe that to fix that there has to be a top-down movement with people who organise it making an effort to be more inclusive.

How did this retro cocktail of cheesy euphoria become such a phenomenon?Friday night in Edinburgh and a troupe of transgender Thai showgirls and their kilted male friends – plus Jamie John, a self-described gay dwarf – are onstage in highland regalia swaying to The Bonnie Banks o’ Loch Lomond, the words of which are being enthusiastically bellowed by the audience. Part wedding reception, part concert, part cabaret, but with a potent flavour all of its own, this Saltire-flying extravaganza is the climax of the latest show by The Lady Boys of Bangkok, who made their debut in Edinburgh 21 years ago, and have been coming back every year since.While critics and much of the media have more or less ignored the Lady Boys, they’re the biggest show on the fringe, drawing in a cross-section of local Scots. There are grans, family groups, hen parties and young couples tucking into wine and Thai food at tables in a sweltering big top tourists and London hipsters however, are conspicuous by their absence. “It’s one of the things of the fringe, you’ve got to come and see it,” says audience member Gary Erskine during the interval. Will he be going to see much other stuff? “This is pretty much it.”The lady boys’ tucks – the ability to make the penis and testicles seemingly disappear when wearing tight bikini bottoms – are a particular wonder. “It’s the tricks of the trade, that’s all I can say,” says John, who shares a dressing room with them. “Seeing is believing!”Then, making this an 18-certificate show, there’s the sleaze. In scenes that call Alan Partridge’s sexual fantasies irresistibly to mind, there are three interludes in which straight Scottish lads are dragged, not entirely unwillingly, on to the stage and felt up by Decha Nuchangsing, a sturdy lady boy with a lecherous demeanour. “They’re tied to a chair and he gives them rather an exotic lap dance, which nine times out of 10 the men enjoy,” says John. Wearing a sequinned jacket, John also presides over a lewd Countdown parody in which the word “happiness” becomes … well, it doesn’t take Carol Vorderman to work it out.The Lady Boys’ main appeal, however, is a communal one. As a raunchy version of One Night in Bangkok set in a hostess bar (this is not a show that shies away from its roots in the Thai sex industry) turns into a Queen tribute in which the cis male dancer Arthur Dy Saensuk dons a moustache to perform as Freddie Mercury, the audience rises to its feet to sing along to Don’t Stop Me Now. Then there’s a shameless selection of crowd-pleasers including Sweet Caroline, This Is Me, YMCA and I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers. Staying in your seat is impossible as I try to take notes a woman behind me grabs my arms and waves them around as the Lady Boys get stuck into Whigfield’s Saturday Night.With its unashamed embrace of cheesy euphoria, it’s not hard to see why The Lady Boys of Bangkok will never be cool – and why they also manage to reach an audience not catered to by much of the fringe. Yet with a plethora of trans and non-binary performers finding their voices in Edinburgh, do the silent, miming Lady Boys seem like relics from another era? While the show has an LGBT cast, it was created and directed by the straight circus impresario Phillip Gandey, and is aimed squarely at a mainstream, heterosexual audience (“This is not a gay show,” the Lady Boys’ spokesman Tony Wilkie-Millar tells me firmly).It’s hard to deny that the Lady Boys are being somewhat exoticised. Audience member Davey Nicoll has travelled to Edinburgh from Inverness to watch the act. “Everybody knows what it is, but you come and enjoy it all the same,” he says. So what is it? “It’s chicks wi’ dicks! It’s curiosity, it’s like PT Barnum, you know The Greatest Showman? It harks back to that for me.”Gandey says that, while prurience may get some people through the door, it’s the quality of the performance that counts. “When we first put it on, curiosity was the only selling point, and that’s still there, but that lasts 10 minutes. If it wasn’t for the standard that these people perform at, the show wouldn’t still be going. One of my most proud achievements is what the Lady Boys of Bangkok has done for transgender people in the United Kingdom. They were the butt of a joke 21 years ago and we’ve made it mainstream. We did This Morning several years ago with Richard and Judy and when they introduced them on the show it wasn’t ‘This is a show about men trying to be women’ they said ‘We’re welcoming one of the UK’s most fabulous dance troupes.’”The day after the show, I sit down with two of the Lady Boys: Sonia and Bombay. In Thailand, lady boys are called kathoeys, and are regarded as a third sex. Sonia and Bombay don’t have much English, but it’s pretty clear from what they say that to be transgender in Thailand is to face discrimination and prejudice. Showbusiness is one of the few arenas in which they can be celebrated for who they are.Theoretically off-duty in dangly earrings, lipgloss and prom dresses, Sonia and Bombay still project megawatt glamour. This is how they dress all the time. Showgirls to their immaculately manicured fingernails, the pair look bored stiff when I try to engage them in gender politics, but come alive when I ask what as they enjoy embodying. “Of course, Kylie,” says Bombay, who does a sensational re-enactment of the video to Can’t Get You Out of My Head. “She is the most popular woman in the UK.”In the programme, Sonia and Bombay are listed as “Mr Uten Pengsa-ard” and “Mr Kornwarin Kaewjaima”, which seems like a deeply retrograde act of misgendering. Nonetheless, the illusion – if it’s even appropriate to call it that – of changing gender is central to their act. Wilkie-Millar says that if any of the Lady Boys transitioned fully, they would no longer be suitable for the show, the same argument that got RuPaul criticised for lack of inclusivity when he told the  that trans women shouldn’t compete on RuPaul’s Drag Race.What about the straight audience’s preoccupation with their genitals? “I don’t think that’s much different from watching RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Woo says. “The transformation of a male identity into a female identity still fascinates and entertains, so to say, ‘It’s old school, it’s not where we’re at now’ – there’s tons of drag in Edinburgh now, but although we might add some politics to it, we’re still playing with the transformation.”Rather than politics, what the Lady Boys want to provide, says Wilkie-Thomas, is escapism. “We’re trying to celebrate being alive and having fun. A woman in the audience told me she’d had chronic back pain for the last six months and this was the first time she’d not felt it. We’re not trying to get our audiences coming out and saying, ‘I’m all for gender freedom.’ We want them to come out and say they’ve had the best fun they’ve had for months.”Maybe there is something inherently subversive or political in what the Lady Boys do in any case. Edinburgh council certainly keeps them at arm’s length. Despite their blockbuster popularity, they’ve been turfed out of the Meadows, where they’ve performed for the last 16 summers – “which is why the fringe’s top-selling show now finds itself on a derelict brewery site outside the city centre,” says Gandey.“We just want to be happy on the stage and express the real us and we hope that the audience accept us as who we are,” says Saensuk. But by the end of the show, the feeling in the room is of more than just acceptance. Maybe it’s the delirious effect of watching 500 Miles performed by Lady Boys in sporrans, but as a sign descends from the ceiling declaring “The Lady Boys of Bangkok love Scotland”, it’s clear that Scotland unreservedly loves them back – a feeling that seems intense enough to last another 21 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a99b6c5b7b8f76c1271c25029d2aee9be9ea63f/0_182_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f5016016c53c2ce9fc9f096231f9789","title":"facebook denies giving contradictory evidence to parliament","story":"Facebook executives did not give contradictory evidence to a parliamentary committee investigating the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the firm has claimed, insisting that it learned of the misuse of data only when the  reported it in December 2015.The company was responding to Damian Collins, the chairman of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, who had sought clarification on points made by two Facebook executives before the committee.He suggested a complaint filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appeared to show that Facebook staff knew about data being compromised earlier than its senior staff acknowledged to MPs.The complaint claimed that, while Facebook staff first raised concerns on the matter in September 2015, Facebook executives said the site first learned of the data misuse months later.However, Facebook’s UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said the company “truthfully answered questions” on the issue and, rather than contradictions, provided accounts of two separate events.“The evidence given to the committees by Mike Schroepfer (chief technology officer), Lord Allan (vice-president for policy solutions) and other Facebook representatives is entirely consistent with the allegations in the SEC Complaint filed 24 July 2019,” Stimson wrote.“In their evidence, Facebook representatives truthfully answered questions about when the company first learned of Aleksandr KoganGSR’s improper transfer of data to Cambridge Analytica, which was in December 2015, through the ’s reporting. We are aware of no evidence to suggest that Facebook learned any earlier of that improper transfer.“As we have told regulators, and many media stories have since reported, we heard speculation about data scraping by Cambridge Analytica in September 2015.

Statements from authorities after Epstein’s death indicated potential co-conspirators were not off the hook.William Barr, the US attorney general, said Monday: “Let me assure you that case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,” and that “any co-conspirators should not rest easy. Victims deserve justice and will get it”.New York authorities have echoed that sentiment.“To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment – which included a conspiracy count – remains ongoing,” Geoffrey S Berman, the Manhattan US attorney, said in a statement.Veteran attorneys interviewed by the  said Epstein’s death would not impede federal prosecutors from pursuing conspiracy cases against others. They also said a controversial non-prosecution agreement agreed with Epstein’s legal team during a previous case was unlikely to now shield any co-conspirators from prosecution.“Conspiracy is a secret agreement between two or more persons. They can focus on one person being the ringleader of that conspiracy but nevertheless, the other persons are involved in that conspiracy,” Richman explained.“They’re all persons involved in the conspiracy and they’re all persons that can be charged – each and every one of them,” he added.Rebecca Roiphe, a professor of law at New York Law School and former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, voiced similar sentiments. “The fact that they brought a conspiracy charge indicates to me that they have other people in mind,” she said.Indeed, numerous court documents point to others’ potential involvement in Epstein’s alleged crimes.The Manhattan US attorney’s case against Epstein for alleged sexual abuse of minor girls as young as 14 includes charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Language in the indictment alleges Epstein “worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct” in luring girls to his Manhattan and Palm Beach homes between 2002 and 2005.Epstein’s controversial non-prosecution agreement with the former Miami US attorney Alexander Acosta – under which he pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges rather than more serious federal crimes for allegations involving dozens of minor girls – also said “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein…”. The paragraph then lists the names of four women and says its agreement is “not limited to” these named parties.Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and media heiress romantically linked to Epstein, has also been accused in civil litigation of recruiting Epstein’s young victims – an allegation she has denied.However, exactly how these others would fit into the investigation is unclear. Some may involve witnesses who were cooperating with investigators against Epstein – and whose cooperation is thus no longer valuable after his death – or they could be separate cases.“What we don’t know is whether or not these third parties who were involved in the conspiracy were already working with the government, or whether they are indictments that were going to be brought later,” Roiphe said.David Weinstein, a white collar criminal defense attorney with Hinshaw \u0026amp Culbertson and former federal prosecutor in Miami, said Epstein’s death wouldn’t impact prosecutors’ attempts to prove others participated in a conspiracy.“It’s the same evidence, the same witnesses,” Weinstein said. Epstein’s death could actually lessen potential issues with evidence.“Now that he’s dead, he can’t challenge that – all of that becomes fair game.”As for Epstein’s plea deal in south Florida 12 years ago, those interviewed were skeptical that it would protect others from prosecution, since they weren’t direct participants in this deal.“Him being dead, the agreement is meaningless because the other parties are not party to the agreement,” Richman said. “They’re the third-party beneficiary.”Possible co-conspirators’ defense lawyers could still try using this deal to their clients’ advantage, arguing that the protections agreed in the deal still exist and extend beyond Florida. But the success of such an argument is not guaranteed to succeed.“In a way, it’s an interpretation of document. The thing is that, I don’t know how these particular iniduals would enforce an agreement they were not signatories on,” Roiphe said.Possible co-conspirators’ lawyers could make an argument that “under contract law, that the government is breaching a promise that it’s made and that you have an interest”.“I think that’s a stretch,” Roiphe said, “but it’s not an impossible argument to make.”Accusers can also pursue civil cases against Epstein despite his death. In the US, litigants can sue deceased persons’ estates in order to win compensation.The lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, told the , “We’ll file an action to vindicate their rights within the next 10 days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af34e0f255923d3164578a3e2eda2046f79d9215/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e753024da361e03b76dd48120c101803","title":"from game of thrones to loving noses life as a self employed sculptor","story":"It takes a meticulous eye for detail to become a sculptor, but for Lydia Smith to make a living out of her art she needs to be equally diligent with her business planningSculptor Lydia Smith splits her time between her personal sculpture projects, running workshops, and the sets of films and TV shows for which she has sculpted props – such as Game of Thrones and Tomb Raider. The 24-year-old artist behind Lydia Smith Sculpture says the secret to fitting it all in is her constant companion: a paperback diary.I think with my hands. I always wanted to use clay and do 3D stuff but I wasn’t allowed. I completely fell in love with sculpture, and figurative in particular, when I started my art foundation. Making something 3D makes so much more sense to me than drawing. My hands just know what to do.One of my tutors told me: “Use a model to make a sculpture, but don’t make a sculpture of the model.” I’m attracted to models who have different angles in their faces and good noses, I love noses. I ask people I know to pose – raise their arms, twist a bit, look in different directions. Depending on what I’m trying to achieve with the mood of the piece, I might elongate or shorten limbs, or twist the torso more to give more drama.I worked on Game of Thrones season eight. There’s quite a lot of polystyrene sculpture used for trees, or castles, or rock formations. Little animals on the King’s Landing set were sculpted out of clay. The time pressure of working on set and never knowing if designers will change their mind is a challenge. My colleague and I had an hour to clad a whole piece and sculpt some rock detail into it, we were completely exhausted by the end then the designers came back and said they now didn’t need it until the next week.It’s part of my ethos to bring sculpture to younger people. I run portrait sculpting and torso sculpting workshops. You just don’t get the opportunity to do it in schools because of all the processes involved, you have to know your anatomy and there are just so many different techniques. It’s just so involved. Most people would have no idea how much stuff goes on behind the scenes of creating one sculpture.Health and safety is a massive part. We use knives and electrical equipment, so I have masks for breathing protection and eye goggles and gloves, which we wear when operating heavy machinery and moulding and casting. I have insurance to cover injuries, to cover my tools in case someone breaks in, and I have it to cover my apprentice, who was working for me one day a week.I’m trying to make my studio as eco-friendly as possible. I make my sculptures on armatures. I mould them and then get them cast in bronze, plaster, and a material called jesmonite. They’re non-toxic, so it’s more eco-friendly than resin. That’s something I’m trying to really bring into my studio, because there’s so much waste within the whole process.This year, I had five months off where there was no film work. Having that time off really pushed my personal work forward. It was really quiet and it enabled me to do some courses in Athens and in Spain. I’ve got five sculptures on the go at the moment, and I did two ice sculpture competitions over the Christmas break. But five months of no pay and all of a sudden it becomes: “I really need to find another film.”I always ask the question and I’m a little bit ballsy. I got my first actual job by wandering around on my tea breaks with my portfolio and breaking into art departments so I could speak with art directors. I love networking, I’m a network addict and I’m always paying attention to what might be next, even though I’m already doing something.I don’t know where I would be without my diary. If something is not in my diary I will just completely forget what it is film work, my personal stuff, my social life, gym, everything. I’m a very visual learner so everything is on this bit of paper, written down, rubbed out, scribbled out, different colours.I’m the most scatty person ever. To run my business as a sole trader I have a business account that everything goes into, I have an app to scan all my receipts and my invoices that calculate all my tax and expenses for the end of each year. A couple of years ago to get my head around it all was hard, but now it’s fine. I’m always on my emails, I always sit down at the end of the day and run through them to flag up the ones I need to reply to.I want to have a public sculpture somewhere someday. Ideally I want to be running workshops to teach people. My own personal goal is to have my artwork in exhibitions in galleries, and for people to commission me to do portrait busts and figures, and then drop in and out of film work whenever I get asked to come in.Lydia Smith takes care of business.

After starting her grooming business, Waggywoo, from her Surrey home conservatory last year, Palmer, 54, says there has been a lot to learn about the different types of customers – animal and human – that come through her doors.I started with my own puppy – a little cavachon. Like most groomers who start out I thought: “I can do this myself.” So I tried, and I made a mess of my own dog. But I really enjoyed it, even though I didn’t know what to do, so I took a couple of professional courses and it snowballed from there.When I started out I would be grooming dogs and not even know their names. But I wanted to have a business where it would be an enjoyable experience for the dogs, being groomed in a relaxed, unhurried environment free from stress. I work from home at the moment so I don’t have massive overheads, which means I am able to devote as much time to each dog as they deserve.I like to allow three hours for each groom. I’m a one-to-one groomer and I prefer to have in no more than three dogs a day. I assess each dog when they come in and discuss what’s required with the owners. One thing I have learned is that even though some may ask me to “take it all off” that’s not what they actually mean, so I take the time to go through everything they want carefully.It runs like clockwork. I make sure my equipment is to hand, charged and ready to go, so everything is running smoothly. There’s nothing worse than grabbing a piece of equipment and it’s not working when you need it. After each groom is done I clean and sterilise my kit and clean and wipe everything down. What people don’t realise is that although it’s dogs, it’s still important to be hygienic and clean.I have an electronic appointment management and customer record system. People can book their own appointments online or on mobile. Each client’s dog has their own record – from any medication they’re taking, any allergies, their behaviour, whether they can eat treats, to whether they are happy with other dogs. I also note exactly what I’ve done during each groom so I can adjust next time if needed. The dogs have a good time and the owners get exactly what they have asked for.I haven’t encountered a dog that I haven’t been able to groom. Most dogs are easy-going if you provide an environment that is relaxing. I have some dogs that just stretch out and lie down on the table. But I also had one dog that was so stressed she wouldn’t let me trim her nails at first – that’s when you have to be sensitive to the dog and know when to ease off.As a groomer you are constantly aware of the safety and wellbeing of your dogs. I have animal first-aid training, but it’s always good to have insurance there, so if you have to pay any vet bills you are covered. I do have business insurance but I haven’t needed to use it – and hope I never have to. But it’s so nice that insurance is there if I ever need it.I’ve learned that every customer is different and all the dogs are different. If an owner is anxious and doesn’t want to leave their dog on their own, I’m perfectly happy for them to stay. For the dogs, I have all sorts of tricks, like sticky treats they can lick when I’m cutting their nails. There’ll be things to take their mind off anything that they’re anxious about.I’m keen to grow my client base. I’m attracting several new clients a week, but it can take anywhere from two to four years to build to a full client list. I started Waggywoo last December so I’m working hard right now on advertising my business and making people aware I’m here.You have to be sensitive and flexible. When customers come in you have to be able to understand them and their dog – what their preferences and needs really are. That’s been my goal – to build a good relationship with my clients so they get what they ask for.Rebecca Palmer takes care of business. AXA Business Insurance takes care of Waggywoo.

The heads of political groups have clashed over when the vote should take place.Salvini is eager to capitalise on his popularity and wants the vote this week. Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the smaller far-right party, Brothers of Italy, have joined the League in aiming for 14 August, after a commemoration service marking the first anniversary of Morandi bridge collapse in Genoa, in which 43 people died.M5S, the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and others opted for 20 August.Salvini, who is deputy prime minister and interior minister, has also threatened to withdraw his seven ministers in order to topple an administration that he says is no longer viable.If Conte loses the confidence vote, the government would have to be dissolved and elections held within 45 to 70 days.Knowing the League could soon seize power, factions from within M5S and the rival PD had discussed teaming up to delay elections by carving out a caretaker government in order to pass the 2020 budget. The PD faction was led by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who still wields influence within the party but is unpopular with voters. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, said late on Monday that “nobody wants to sit at the table with Renzi”, while the party’s founder, Beppe Grillo, called him a vulture. The PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, also ruled out such a move, saying it would be a “gift to the dangerous right”, while appealing for unity within his party.Di Maio rallied his MPs on Monday morning and had reportedly accused Salvini of betraying the government contract for his own interests. Di Maio said on Friday that he favoured a return to the polls, but that first he first wanted parliament to adopt a reform to cut the number of senators and deputies from 951 to 605.The decision to dissolve the government and call fresh elections rests with the president, Sergio Mattarella. He could install a technical government, but that option also tends to be unpopular with voters.The three parties joined forces before national elections in March 2018 and compete together at the regional level. A coalition between the League and the Brothers of Italy, a party with a neo-fascist lineage, would create a fully far-right government in a major western European nation.“We genuinely rule out that there is any life left in this parliament and we consider elections in October as a baseline scenario,” Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political consultancy, said in a note.Franco Pavoncello, a political science professor and the president of John Cabot University in Rome, said: “There are people who don’t want elections right away, others who want them desperately and others who are sort of neutral. But I think it’s a long way to Tipperary for the elections … the last time Italy held a vote in the autumn was in 1919, just before Benito Mussolini’s victory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0bbe87f26e561540ef632d36d4b23c494c0a600/0_237_5433_3260/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bd4f9d3967a2ae2ccad41b4811dc035","title":"modi talks of his positivity on bear gryllss man vs wild","story":"Indian prime minister also spoke of growing up poor and developing a love of natureThe Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, joined Bear Grylls on the latter’s survival TV programme Man vs Wild to talk about his relationship with nature and growing up in a poor family, all the while crossing a freezing river on a flimsy raft.In the episode broadcast in India on Monday, the two men were filmed on the riverbank of the country’s Jim Corbett National Park, with deer and a herd of elephants seen in the distance.The boy who once sold tea at a railway station has become the most influential Indian leader in generations, winning a landslide in the 2019 elections. Or so goes the story that has become the core of Narendra Modi’s extraordinary appeal.Modi was born in 1958 to a poor family in western India’s Gujarat state, where he developed a strong dislike for the ruling Congress party as a result of hanging around a political office near his father’s tea stall.While still a child, he started attending daily meetings of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said to be the world’s largest volunteer organisation, whose Hindu nationalist ideology envisions the country’s erse Hindu population as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be given primacy in India.BJP’s support was limited to wealthier Hindus in the country’s north and west, with resistance to the party from poor, marginalised Hindus, Muslims and south Indians thought to be permanent hurdles to Hindu nationalist domination.Modi’s magnetism, especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country’s highest ranks, has changed those calculations, drawing vast support from the country’s emerging middle and lower-middle classes. Young Indians had grown up being told their country was on the cusp of becoming a superpower. In Modi they had a leader who spoke as if it already was.Alongside aspiration, the BJP promotes a vision of Hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country’s 300m minority population. As chief minister of Gujarat state, Modi was a firebrand Hindutva campaigner. In 2002, anti-Muslim riots in his state killed at least 1,000 people, resulting in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the US.In response, Modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging, that he was constantly being targeted by the English-speaking media out of Delhi.When popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous Congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011, it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard. His mastery of political theatre, and finger on the pulse of Indians, has now secured him the strongest mandate of any leader in decades.Grylls’s remark that the river was full of crocodiles prompted Modi, wearing a cap and mackintosh, to tell him how as a poor boy, with no bathroom at home, he used to bathe in a pond every day. Apparently, one day, he found a baby crocodile and took it home, but his mother scolded him and told him to return the animal to the river.It was one of several childhood anecdotes related by Modi. He also recalled how his father used to celebrate the occasion of the first rain of the season by buying 25 to 30 postcards and sending them to relatives, writing simply, “Today it rained in our village” to express his joy.Modi went on to speak of how his uncle once suggested that, given his parents’ straitened circumstances, they could try selling wood to burn for cooking. But his grandmother vetoed the idea: “My grandmother said no to selling wood. She said wood has life in it. The environment is intrinsic to our lives.”The main task of the episode was for Grylls and Modi to cross the river. Grylls attempted to drum up some drama by breathlessly pointing to some tiger tracks in the mud and then making a spear out of a branch that he offered to Modi as protection. Modi politely declined and fashioned a makeshift raft from branches, reeds and some conveniently located tarpaulin.The two men got into the raft, and Modi seemed unfazed when it started pouring with rain. Grylls proceeded to dial up the deference and asked Modi how he coped with fear or nervousness. Modi replied that such was his “positivity”, he had never experienced those emotions.Modi also told Grylls that his love of nature had begun when he left home as a teenager. “I went to the Himalayas since I liked nature. I met people there and stayed with him. I got to learn a lot from them.” Indian viewers might have been taken aback after seeing this side to their recently re-elected prime minister as, in the public consciousness, his image is that of a strongman – iron-willed, stern, and boasting a “56-inch chest”, a claim Modi once made to project the idea of a macho leader who gets things done. Other famous personalities that have featured on Man vs Wild are tennis player Roger Federer and former US president Barack Obama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8b313489fa18f18bc27bc0f85629ad40b8a0c5/0_91_2330_1398/master/2330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de86ae85e36e8d8e7dacfb7f617275db","title":"mps call for tougher penalties on drivers using mobile phones","story":"Committee says ban on hands-free use should be considered amid rise in road deathsTougher restrictions on drivers using mobile phones, including extending the ban to hands-free devices, should be considered, MPs have said.The transport select committee said using any type of mobile phone while driving had potentially catastrophic consequences. The MPs called for more severe penalties “commensurate with the risks”, as road deaths linked to phone use have risen steadily over the past decade.In 2017, there were 773 casualties on Britain’s roads, including 43 deaths and 135 serious injuries, in crashes in which the driver was using a mobile phone.But rates of enforcement had dropped by more than two-thirds since 2011, the committee said, as it called on the government to work with police to make better use of technology and deter offenders.Although penalties for using a handheld mobile phone while driving were doubled in 2017 – to six points on a licence and a £200 fine – the committee said they should be reviewed and potentially increased.Given evidence that phone use diminished driving ability as much as drink-driving, the committee said the government should explore whether to extend the ban to hands-free calls. Although it acknowledged there would be practical challenges, it recommended that the government launch a public consultation on criminalising the use of hands-free devices by drivers.The committee chair, Lilian Greenwood MP, said far too many drivers continued to break the law by using handheld mobile phones, despite the risks. She said: “If mobile phone use while driving is to become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, much more effort needs to go into educating drivers about the risks and consequences of using a phone behind the wheel.“Offenders also need to know there is a credible risk of being caught, and that there are serious consequences for being caught.”She added: “There is also a misleading impression that hands-free use is safe. The reality is that any use of a phone distracts from a driver’s ability to pay full attention, and the government should consider extending the ban to reflect this.”Motoring organisations the RAC and the AA backed calls for a review and said enforcement was a crucial factor. Edmund King, the AA president, said: “Offenders think the chance of being caught is minimal. Following a reduction of specialist traffic officers by a third, a good deterrent would be to have more cops in cars targeting those tempted to pick up the phone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/163731bae0a8d71a92f084f3eabdbe45c2690706/0_0_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28fbd510ea338288cdec4f6f18dc8e53","title":"tuesday briefing alarming frequency of near blackouts","story":"Ofgem chasing explanations from National Grid … fatal stabbing in Camden, north London … and best jokes of the Edinburgh festivalHello – Warren Murray shedding some light on matters this morning.National Grid put Friday’s chaotic blackout down to “incredibly rare” circumstances but the electricity network had three near-misses in as many months leading up to it. has been told that in every month since May there has been a “frequency excursion” – a severe dip in the grid’s frequency from its normal range around 50Hz.

About 131m cases of the sexually transmitted infection are diagnosed worldwide every year and there were almost 220,000 new cases in England in 2019. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but infection often has no symptoms and many people are unaware they have it. It is described as a “hidden epidemic” which without treatment can lead to fertility issues and an increased risk of HIV. The findings raise hopes that the jab could eventually be given at the same time as the HPV vaccine, which protects against certain cancers including that of the cervix.More proof of climate crisis – Gases heating the planet in 2018 were higher than humans have ever recorded, according to findings by the American Meteorological Society and US government. Greenhouse gas levels exceeded 60 years of modern measurements and 800,000 years of ice core data. The data was collected from more than 470 scientists in 60 countries. The global annual average for carbon dioxide – elevated by activities like driving cars and burning fuel – was 407.4 parts per million, 2.4 ppm higher than in 2017. And 2018 was the fourth-warmest on record since the mid- to late-1800s, while sea levels were the highest on record as global heating melted land-based ice and expanded the oceans. Sea surface temperatures were also near a record high while Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent was near a record low and glaciers continued to melt and lose mass for the 30th consecutive year.Canada suspects died by suicide – The triple-murder suspects Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky killed themselves, police have said after autopsies.

What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational – politics, in other words. Their fundamental demand – stopping Brexit – is now firmly in the mainstream. But with Boris Johnson in No 10 and 31 October approaching, the remainists are running out of time.” Separately, John Denham argues that for the sake of Britain’s own union, the “English interest” needs to be separated from ugly English nationalism. “English-identifying voters are the least satisfied with their political representation and are unlikely to feel Westminster understands them. They want English laws made by English MPs, and many would like a parliament for England. Certainly, if the union is to survive, English voters need to be convinced of its modern relevance just as much as voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.”Eddie Jones has admitted he is powerless to stop England’s problem with off-field indiscipline after omitting Ben Te’o from his World Cup squad following his altercation with Mike Brown at a recent training camp in Treviso. England paceman Jofra Archer has insisted on the eve of his Test debut at Lord’s on Wednesday that he is ready for the five-day challenge and warned Australia not to doubt his stamina.

Now that it’s firmly bedded in, it’s clear that – as with the old system – grades tend to stay largely the same from one year to the next.This is because, unlike at third level, where grades have been rising across the majority of higher-education institutions over the past few decades, the Leaving Cert exam is marked on a bell curve. This means that the number of top and low grades tends to be relatively smaller and that the majority of students are usually bunched between a H2O2 and H4O4.But, within this, there has always been a significant difference in the marks awarded in each subject. Latin students are over seven times more likely than English students to get top marks. Physics students are almost four times more likely than art students to get a H1, but they’re also over five times more likely to fail.What accounts for these differences and do some subjects offer an “easier” honour than others? For students looking for top marks and the highest points score, it’s not as straightforward as this. While physics and chemistry, for instance, gives out a relatively high number of H1 and H8 grades, this is because students with a high aptitude for the subject tend to be drawn to it and can do well, but for students with less aptitude for the maths and formulas involved, it can be a real struggle. And, where subject numbers are low, it’s often the case that the subject in question has drawn in students who particularly enjoy or excel at it.To put the results of the class of 2019 in context, we took a look at some other subjects.MathsNo student wants to fail maths, because a pass is a basic entry requirement for most third-level courses. Since the introduction of 25 bonus points for higher-level maths in 2012, as well as the rollout of the Project Maths syllabus, which places a greater emphasis on the real-world application of maths, policy-makers have been paying close attention to maths grades.The intention of the bonus points and the revised syllabus was to encourage more students to take higher maths and, ultimately, to enter into more science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) courses at third-level. And with the number of students taking the higher-level paper having more than doubled since 2012, the policy has been a success, although there are repeated rumblings from the third-level sector that students on some courses do not have the level of maths needed.This year, approximately 1,089 higher-level students (6 per cent) got a H1, compared to 5.5 per cent last year. Overall, 78.4 per cent of higher-level students got an honour, compared to 79.4 per cent last year. The higher-level fail rate rose slightly, from 1.7 to 1.8 per cent (a total of 326 students), but down from 2 per cent in 2017. Meanwhile, the mode grade (which occurred most often) was, as last year, a H4.At ordinary level, the number of O1s went up from 1.5 per cent (470 of 31,336 candidates) to 1.7 per cent (535 of 31,474 candidates). The fail rate at ordinary level, however, will be of concern to policymakers and educators, as it has risen from 9.6 per cent in 2018 to 10.9 per cent in 2019 (3,430 of 31,474 candidates). This may reflect the possibility that weaker maths students, who are not among the growing cohort taking the higher-level paper, are being left behind.Taken together, the higher- and ordinary-level maths failure rate means that around 3,756 out of a total of 55,094 students (6.8 per cent of all Leaving Cert students) have failed maths and will consequently see their third-level options severely narrow. With so many students being left behind at ordinary level, this will raise inevitable questions about the approach to maths teaching at second level.EnglishThis year, higher-level English tied with construction studies for one of the lowest number of H1 grades (2.9 per cent). Agricultural economics proved tougher, as not one of the 31 students who sat the paper achieved a H1.The flipside of this is that, excluding some minority language subjects such as Czech a.nd Russian, English consistently has one of the lowest higher-level failure rates, tied with higher-level French and home economics at just 0.6 per cent. Nobody failed ancient Greek, but only 17 students sat the subject, while none of the 31 candidates for agricultural economics failed either.Overall, 84.7 per cent of higher-level English students were awarded an honour this year.At ordinary level, 1.6 per cent of students got a H1 while 6.5 per cent failed.Irish A new system will mean it is easier for students to be granted an exemption from Irish but, although the debate around compulsory Irish remains isive, it’s a subject where students tend to do relatively well, with 87.1 of higher-level students earning an honour.Of these, 5.7 per cent got a H1, a rise from 4.9 per cent last year. Just 0.4 per cent failed higher-level Irish, the lowest failure rate outside music (0.1 per cent) agricultural economics and the minority languages.At ordinary level, just 0.3 per cent got a H1 while 9.1 per cent (approximately 625 students) failed.Minority languagesMinority language students tend to do well in their exams because they almost always come from a family where that language is spoken at home by at least one parent, and they may have been raised bilingually. Of the 12 students sitting Czech, 6 got a H1, while 19.4 per cent of the 62 Latvian students got top marks and 18.5 per cent of the 340 students sitting the Romanian paper got a H1.High fail ratesClassical studies remains an anomaly: 3.2 per cent of 440 higher-level students failed (a drop from 5.1 per cent last year but still a relatively high fail rate compared to other subjects), while 19.2 per cent of the 52 ordinary-level students failed the subject. A new course will be introduced in September 2020 and examined for the first time in 2022.Physics also had one of the higher fail rates, although it was down from 8.2 per cent in 2017 to 7.7 per cent in 2018 and 7.4 per cent today. Chemistry also had a relatively high fail rate at 7.5 per cent, up from 7.3 per cent in last year. Agricultural science also proved challenging, with 7.3 per cent of 6,605 higher-level students getting a H8, up from 4.9 per cent of 6,543 students last yearBut the highest fail rate of all was, as is usually the case, in the combined subject of physics \u0026amp chemistry, where 11.4 per cent didn’t make the grade (a rise from 10.1 per cent last year).Somewhat surprisingly, 7.8 per cent of 116 students sitting the Portuguese paper failed, despite the fact that many (if not most) of them will be from Portuguese-speaking families, primarily Brazilian in origin.High pass and honours ratesChemistry may have one of the higher fail rates, but it also awards one of the highest number of H1 grades outside Latin and minority subjects, with 13.2 per cent of 8,244 higher-level students taking top marks and three-quarters securing an honour. Likewise, physics students have a good shot of top marks, with 10.8 securing a H1 this year. Only applied maths students fared better, with 16.2 per cent awarded a H1 and 81.1 per cent securing an honour this may because applied maths tends to attract students who have a natural aptitude for the subject."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3984311.1565642207!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert 2019 students secure record total of cao points","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWith more than 421,000 additional CAO points awarded  because of the maths bonus points system, points for many highly sought-after programmes will increase.Download\u0026nbsp 2019 Leaving Cert results by grade and subjectLeaving Cert students have scored more CAO points than ever in this year’s exams due to larger numbers than ever sitting subjects at higher level.The increase is linked to more generous grading changes introduced in recent years which reward students for taking on subjects at higher level.The numbers taking and performing well at higher level have increased across the board but, in particular, in core subjects such as English, Irish and maths.In the case of maths, for example, a record 33 per cent – or just over 18,000 students – took the higher-level paper.The vast majority of this cohort secured the additional 25 bonus CAO points on offer for the subject.With more than 421,000 additional CAO points awarded in 2019 because of the maths bonus points system, points for many highly sought-after programmes will inevitably increase.However, there are concerns over more than 3,700 students who have failed maths, which may lock many out of third-level courses which stipulate a pass as a basic entry requirement.The bulk of those who failed to secure a pass grade sat the ordinary-level maths paper, where the failure rate was just over 10 per cent, while just under 2 per cent failed the higher-level paper.Teachers say many schools are not offering foundation-level maths tuition due to resource shortages, which means significant numbers of weaker students end up struggling at ordinary level.In all, more than 58,000 Leaving Cert students are due to receive their results today, while CAO offers are due to be released at 2pm on Thursday, several days earlier than normal.High achieversStudents who appeal their exam grades will also receive their results three weeks earlier than normal.The changes follow a High Court case last year which ruled that the delays in issuing appeal results were highly unfair to students and should not be repeated this year.Meanwhile, a total of five high-achieving students scored maximum points in this year’s exams, with eight H1s (90-100 per cent). A further 60 candidates scored seven H1s, while 235 scored 6 H1s.The record number of pupils sitting subjects at higher level follows an overhaul of the grading system introduced two years ago.Under the grading changes, students scoring 30-39 per cent at higher level – previously considered a fail – are now awarded a pass and with it valuable CAO points. The maximum number of points awarded for ordinary-level papers was also reduced.This has incentivised many who might previously have sat the ordinary-level paper to opt for the higher level.The gamble has paid off for most students with a large majority securing honours grades and remarkably low failure rates.In Irish, a breakdown of this year’s grades show one in 12, or more than 6,000 pupils, did not sit the exam.This is because they either had an official exemption or simply opted not to sit the exam itself. While it is compulsory to study Irish, it is not mandatory to sit the exam itself.Irish gradesDespite its reputation as one of the toughest subjects, a breakdown of this year’s grades shows most students performed well in it.Some 87 per cent of higher-level students secured what used to be known as an honour, while it had one of the lowest fail rates of any major subject.Leaving Cert students who are unhappy with their grades, meanwhile, are being urged to act quickly to apply online to see their exam scripts.They must apply online between 9am on Wednesday, August 14th, and 5pm on Friday, August 16th.Minister for Education Joe McHugh has congratulated this year’s Leaving Cert students, but added that there are “many more days and changes that will define your future”.“There are many paths open to you, with a wide range of opportunities available in higher education, further education, post-Leaving Cert courses and apprenticeship and traineeship routes,” he said.“There are also an increasing number of options and opportunities for students regionally. More lead-in courses, more choice at institutes of technology and colleges planning for technological university status.”Teachers’ unions have also urged students to remain calm in the days ahead so that they can explore all of their options and make sound decisions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3983866.1565610594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six take away points from this year s leaving cert results","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA third of students are now taking higher level maths with the vast majority of them securing bonus points. Photograph: iStock1. More performing well in higher level papersThe most significant trend evident in this year’s results is a steady increase in the numbers taking higher level papers and performing well in them. This trend is evident across a wide range of subjects, particularly in the core subjects of Irish, English and maths.Looking at the percentage breakdown of candidates by grade, 5.7 per cent scored an A1 in higher level Irish, up from 4.9 per cent in 2018. Of those sitting higher level mathematics, 6 per cent achieved an A1 this year, up from 5.5 per cent in 2018. While the percentage of students achieving an A1 in higher level English remains unchanged this year at 2.9 per cent, the number of those sitting the exam increased by almost 2,000. 2. Boost for the smart economyThose in Government and industry concerned about our ability to provide the booming technology sector with a supply line of suitably qualified graduates will be pleased to see increases in the numbers taking higher level applied maths (up 150 to 1,988). Technology (up 265), physics (up 325), chemistry (up 300) and biology (up 520) also saw increases in the numbers taking the higher paper. Similarly, those concerned about supplying the construction sector with a solid graduate stream will be pleased with the 11 per cent increase in the numbers of higher level students in construction studies to 7,896. Of those who sat the exam, 2.9 per cent achieved an A1.The strength of the overall economy is reflected in the increased interest in accounting, up 10 per cent at higher level to 6,095, and in business, up 3.5 per cent to 13,805. 3. More securing bonus points in mathsA total of 18,153 (33 per cent) students took the higher level paper in mathematics in 2019, and 16,846 secured the additional 25 bonus CAO points. With 421,150 additional CAO points awarded in 2019 because of the maths bonus points system, points for highly sought-after programmes, where applications remain strong, are inevitably going to increase.4. History and geography increasesAn increase was also recorded in the numbers taking higher level history with 315 more taking the exam this year. This will please Minister for Education Joe McHugh who has very publicly backed the study of history in our schools. Similarly, those who are calling for the retention of geography as a core subject at junior cycle level will be pleased that a further 877 students took the subject at higher level, bringing numbers up to 19,983.Conversely, interest in Latin and classical studies has dropped to very low levels with the numbers of higher level students this year at 54 and 440 respectively. The changing nature of Irish society is captured by the numbers taking Italian (473) which is taught in several of our schools in contrast with the numbers taking Polish (780) and Russian (458) which are generally taken by students outside school. 5. Drop in politics and LCVPIt is interesting that politics and society, which attracted 857 students in its first year in 2018, saw the numbers drop to 779 in 2019. Another interesting aspect of this year’s results are the decreases in the numbers taking the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) to 13,124. Even more worrying is the decrease in those securing a distinction in the LCVP, from 12 per cent in 2018 to 8.4 per cent this year. Given its role in familiarising students with the world of work, it is concerning to see it decreasing in interest among students, and performance at the highest level dropping significantly. The main concern for students and parents today will be whether the 2019 Leaving Cert results tell us anything about the CAO points requirements which will be published at 2pm on Thursday.Given the overall increase in the number of candidates this year, the rise in numbers taking higher level, the fact that a third of students are now taking higher level maths with the vast majority of them securing bonus points, it is inevitable that a large number of students will be entering the competition for places next college year with higher points than their predecessors in 2018. If the numbers of places on offer in these programmes stay the same, the cut-off student CAO score is bound to increase. If additional places are offered or applications dip for specific programmes, then the points increase may not take place.

Photograph: Tatyana ZenkovichEPA.Fireballs and shooting stars await stargazers with an eye on the sky on Monday night with the annual Perseid meteor shower set to reach its peak in the early hours.The shower is one of the most reliable events of the astronomic calendar, and can be observed with the naked eye under clear skies.This year, because of an almost full moon, many of the meteors will be drowned out by moonlight. Stargazers can still expect to see around 70 shooting stars per hour, with the most intense showers at 3am.On clear nights in recent years, spectators have been greeted by as many as 150-200 meteors an hour.The meteors can be smaller than a grain of sand but travel at speeds of 58km per second, before burning up at temperatures of 3,000 to 10,000 degrees in the Earth’s atmosphere.David Moore, the founder of Astronomy Ireland, said he had been watching the Perseids since he was 11. With the moon blotting out smaller shooting stars, Mr Moore advised stargazers to “stand with your back to the moon, look to the darkest part of the sky in the north, and you’ll see at least one a minute”.To those wary of a late Monday night, he warned: “If you’re stuck in bed, you’ll miss the celestial fireworks display of the year.”The Perseids, so called because they radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus, were linked to the comet Swift-Tuttle in 1862 by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1862.Although it peaks tonight, the meteor shower is expected to continue until August 24th due to the size of the dust stream."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3984222.1565636023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plans for chinese garden of friendship in dublin halted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Dublin City Council image of how the Yi Garden could look in Herbert Park.The planned installation of a Chinese “friendship garden” in Dublin’s Herbert Park will not go ahead next month, due to the decision of the Chinese sponsor city to reassess its support for the project.The Yi Garden, which translates as “garden of friendship” was exhibited as one of the show gardens in Bloom in the Phoenix Park in June 2016. The following month Dublin city councillors were told the garden had been offered to the council “as a bridge of friendship connecting Ireland and China”.Deputy council chief executive, Brendan Kenny, then in charge of culture and recreation, told councillors the Chinese Embassy has requested that, “if possible, the garden be located in a park close to the Chinese embassy on Merrion Road”.In his report to councillors in July 2016 Mr Kenny said: “Herbert Park, the most prestigious park in the area is considered fitting as a permanent location for the garden. The exact location within the park would be adjacent to the gate entrance from the new street ( at Herbert Park Hotel) which leads to the pond.”The garden was designed in a style popular in Yangzhou City, in Jiangsu province, an ancient city famous for its gardens, Islamic relics and ancient shrines. It included a pagoda-style shelter, planting, seating, a rockery, a pond and waterfall.“Yangzhou City will cover the cost of the garden construction on site by Chinese craftsmen who will travel from China. There will also be ancillary costs for Dublin City Council which can be covered in the existing Parks budget,” Mr Kenny said.However, the garden never went ahead.AdviceLast April, the council’s senior executive parks superintendent Michael Noonan told councillors the project was still going ahead. Work would begin in September and take approximately six weeks, he said.In a further update last month, Mr Noonan said a new location on the western side of the park, close to tearoom and toilets, on a “disused hard surface area” had been chosen for the garden.However, this week Mr Noonan told councillors he had “been advised by our Chinese partners” that work on the garden would not go ahead in September to allow a “re-evaluation of the project”.Olga Wang, culture and tourism attaché with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin, said the embassy was not involved in the project.“Most of the staff came in 2017 the year after the garden arrangement,” she said. “We encourage any project that benefits cultural exchanges but we are not involved in this.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3984777.1565678356!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vaccine against chlamydia moves a step closer after successful clinical trial","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChlamydia infection. Computer illustration of a cell infected with Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria.  Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection that can go undetected causing infertility.A vaccine to protect against the common sexually transmitted infection (STI) chlamydia is safe and has shown promising signs of being effective, a clinical trial has found.Researchers found the vaccine provoked an immune response during preliminary tests on 35 healthy women.Further trials will now be carried out to determine whether it can fully protect against the infection, but experts say it is an “important first step” in tackling the condition.“The findings are encouraging as they show the vaccine is safe and produces the type of immune response that could potentially protect against chlamydia,” said Professor Robin Shattock, from Imperial College London. “The next step is to take the vaccine forward to further trials, but until that’s done, we won’t know whether it is truly protective or not.”Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the world and accounts for almost half of all STIs diagnosed in England, with young adults the most affected.It can lead to infertility, as well as complications such as ectopic pregnancy, arthritis and increased susceptibility to other STIs such as HIV.AntibioticsThe infection is currently treated with antibiotics, but people can still catch it again. As many as three out of four cases show no symptoms.“The major issue with chlamydia is the long-term consequences,” said Professor Shattock.“It is very treatable if identified, but as many people don’t have symptoms it can be missed, and the biggest problem is that it can go on to cause infertility in women.“One of the problems we see with current efforts to treat chlamydia is that despite a very big screening, test and treat programme, people get repeatedly re-infected. If you could introduce a protective vaccine, you could break that cycle.”Different formulationsThe study, led by Imperial College London and the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, tested two different formulations of the vaccine to examine which would perform better.Both formulations provoked an immune response in 100 per cent of participants – compared to no immune response in those given a placebo – but one was found to perform better and produce more antibodies.The experts hope this formulation will undergo further clinical development.The research, published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, found the vaccines produced no serious adverse reactions. – PA "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Jessica Moore was due to get her Leaving Certificate results on TuesdayMarket transparency and introduction of a price index among issues in proposalsChlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the world and can lead to infertilityCAO set to issue first round of university offers on Thursday afternoonThousands of prospective students who applied for third-level courses will receive offers this weekCheck your scripts if you think you should have received a better gradeThe 2019 results are out a day earlier than in previous years and students can choose how to collect themMore students sitting higher-level subjects but concern for 3,700 failing mathsSteady increase in numbers taking higher level papersHow many got top marks or failed in English, Irish and maths, and what does it all mean?\u0026lsquoPowerful and unerring\u0026rsquo mathematician born in Skreen, Co Sligo, 200 years agoLighthouse keepers who risked their lives will pay tribute on Sunday to the 19 men who drownedA 1932 Rolls Royce became oldest car to pass National Car Test last yearDecision comes after sponsor opts to reassess support for Herbert Park installationMove from meat processor comes as industry faced off against protestersFemale inmates must \u0026lsquogo without\u0026rsquo sanitary products at times, internal report states\u0026lsquoSome people have very well-laid-out career plans and ambitions but I took a lot of u-turns and side steps along my career\u0026rsquoNCT results analysis shows strong correlation between pass rates and age of vehiclesBeef Plan movement says processor and retailer not farmer get most of consumer priceFF\u0026rsquos Donnelly says HSE\u0026rsquos failure to meet its own targets \u0026lsquonever ceases to astonish\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3984773.1565678618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"beef talks adjourn with some progress made","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the grassroots Beef Plan movement met representatives of the IFA, Meat Industry Ireland and Department of Agriculture.

The independent chairman Michael Dowling is to circulate a document based on the proposals that were put forward, according to a statement from the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA). IFA President Joe Healy said some progress had been made on market transparency and the introduction of a price index.He said there is also a commitment to look at the market specifications that impact on price that exist in the grid. It is expected that the talks will reconvene on Thursday or Monday next.On Monday all sides set out their respective positions on prices paid to cattle producers by meat processors.Members of the grassroots Beef Plan movement met representatives of the IFA, Meat Industry Ireland and Department of Agriculture, on Monday in a bid to find a settlement to the increasingly bitter dispute between farmers and processors over prices paid for cattle. Pat McCormack of ICMSA said he hopes talks could resume as early as Thurday morning. He hopes the response from Meat Industry Ireland will be positive. He repeated ca all for transparency in the industry. He said he is ‘pretty confident’ of a positive outcome. He said Brexit is a massive unknown as UK is the largest market. Talks were “extremely tense” because of the financial pressures, he said. Speaking during a break in negotiations late last night, IFA president Joe Healy said progress had been made in discussions on transparency on pricing and “a review of the grid system”.The grid is a system which ranks cattle by the letters E, U, R, O and P, as well as fat stores under the numbers 1,2,3.A good beef cow would be a U3 while a good dairy cow would be a P2.Mr Healy said a document would be put together on the nature of the review of the grid and would be studied by all parties.Mr Healy reiterated that farmers needed to know the Government response to Brexit, which he said should include about €1 billion in supports and direct aid.During the round-table discussions at the Department of Agriculture’s Backweston Campus in Co Kildare, the Beef Plan movement put forward its case that beef processors and retailers got the largest share of the consumer price for beef.This was against the background of processors and retailers handling cattle for a few days, they said, while farmers spent two years rearing cattle.Members of Beef Plan have claimed that for every €10 of beef bought off shelves, the farmer takes €2, the processor gets €2.90, and the supermarket gets €5.10.Mr Healy said beef farmers’ incomes were totally unsustainable and he quoted Teagasc National Farm Survey data for 2018 which showed cattle-rearing incomes at €8,813 on average.He said “confidence, hope and viability have been destroyed by the factories and this has to change”.Meat processors, represented by Meat Industry Ireland, had earlier said “real damage has been done to domestic and export business” as a result of the protests and it was “high time for the sector to get back to business”.“Processing needs to take place if we are to avoid losing more customers for Irish beef and lamb,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3984255.1565636990!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us would strongly support no deal brexit says john bolton","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS national security adviser John Bolton in London: “We’re with you, we’re with you.” Photograph: Peter NichollsThe United States would enthusiastically support a no-deal Brexit if that is what the British government decided to do, US national security adviser John Bolton said on Monday during a visit to London aimed at reassuring Britain over UK-US ties.Mr Bolton told British prime minister Boris Johnson that President Donald Trump wants to see a successful British exit from the European Union on October 31st and that Washington would be ready to work fast on a US-UK free trade agreement.As things stand, Britain faces an exit on October 31st without any formal transition period or legal agreement covering issues such as trade, data transfers and border policy.“If that’s the decision of the British government, we will support it enthusiastically, and that’s what I’m trying to convey. We’re with you, we’re with you,” Mr Bolton told reporters after his first day of meetings.Improved relationshipMr Bolton, in London for two days of talks, is seeking an improved US-British relationship with Mr Johnson after sometimes tense links between Mr Trump and Theresa May. He said British officials had given him an unmistakable sense that they were determined to honour the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU. Mr Bolton offered his support for this stance.“The fashion in the European Union: when the people vote the wrong way from the way the elites want to go, it’s to make the peasants vote again and again until they get it right,” he said.The central message Mr Bolton was delivering is that the US would help cushion Britain’s exit from the EU with a free trade deal that is being negotiated by US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and his British counterpart, Liz Truss. Financial sectorMr Bolton said Britain and the US could agree trade deals on a sector-by-sector basis, leaving more difficult areas in the trading relationship until later. He said the ultimate aim was a comprehensive trade deal, but highlighted that financial services could be one of the more difficult industries to reach an agreement on.Earlier, a senior Trump administration official told travelling reporters the president had wanted to work with the May government on a trade deal but her government “didn’t want do it. This government does. We’re very happy about it.”Mr Trump believes that “when it comes to trade negotiations the EU is worse than China, only smaller”, the official said.Mr Johnson spoke to Mr Trump on Monday. “They discussed global economic issues and trade, and the prime minister updated the president on Brexit,” Downing Street said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

its valueStaff and agenciesClick to followThe IndependentThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is looking into claims that the share price of Burford Capital – the second-largest holding in Neil Woodford’s suspended fund – was illegally manipulated around the time of an attack by US hedge fund Muddy Waters.Burford, which provides funding for legal action and takes a cut of the resulting settlements, saw its share value nosee over the past week after Muddy Waters took a short position on the stock, betting that its value would fall, before publishing a damning report on the company’s financial health.On Monday Burford said it examined trading data covering 6 August, when Muddy Waters tweeted about a forthcoming but unidentified short target, and 7 August, when the hedge fund released its report and started shorting the stock. The data suggested trading was “consistent with material illegal activity”.An FCA spokesperson responded: “The FCA has been aware of these matters since the first tweet and price movements on Tuesday of last week and at that point we began undertaking wide-ranging enquiries. We will continue to make enquiries using the wide range of data and resources at our disposal.”Burford said it detected signs of spoofing and layering – illegal methods of driving down share prices, which have resulted in convictions previously.For example, trading data showed that there was “an unusual flood” of order cancellations beginning shortly before Muddy Waters’ original tweet. Burford also said: “While Muddy Waters was suggesting that Burford was insolvent, it was at the same time buying Burford shares.”In its report, Muddy Waters labelled Burford a “poor business masquerading as a great one”. Burford’s shares plunged by 65 per cent over the course of 6 and 7 August, with almost £2bn wiped off the firm’s value.The following day, Burford hit back against the report, accusing Muddy Waters of peddling “factual inaccuracies” and “fallacious insinuations”.Christopher Bogart, chief executive of Burford, said the company’s “market-leading” business is the same as it was a week ago.He said: “What has changed is that a substantial amount of market value was wiped out by activity we believe is consistent with illegal market manipulation that has nothing to do with Burford’s business. That is wrong and that is illegal.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s great if you\u0027ve got the guts for it.”Clive Fenton, the former chief executive of fellow housebuilder McCarthy and Stone, is providing assistance to the review as an industry expert.The consultation period closes on 16 September, with findings of the review due by the end of the year.Roger Devlin, chairman of Persimmon, said: “It is important that we listen in order to improve and this consultation process is a vital step in hearing from our customers, employees, and many other people important to our business.“We hope that as many of our stakeholders as possible will take the time to contribute to this important process and I am very grateful to them for participating.”Persimmon faced criticism last year as it handed out hefty bonuses to executives, despite scoring relatively low for customer satisfaction in the industry.Former chief executive Jeff Fairburn\u0027s circa £75m pay package in particular came under fire.He later stepped down, blaming the “distraction” of his pay deal.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was how they were produced and how people used them when they got to the UK that matters. So that was a real eye-opener.”Most of this comes from\u0026nbspfertilisers,\u0026nbsppesticides and the fuel used by machinery during harvesting.They are then processed and sorted. If the orange is used to make juice, 22 per cent of the total footprint is down to transport and distribution.Professor Reay said: “If you just assume everything closer to you is better, so if you’re thinking these blueberries or cucumber from Holland in January will be low carbon, they\u0026nbspwon’t be. It’s going to be intensive production with a high carbon footprint.“This will massively outweigh the food miles of bringing them\u0026nbspfrom a country where the climate is right at that time of year.”Created with Sketch.Teenage climate change protesters threatened with arrest at Heathrow  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Four teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersFour teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersAccording to government data, buying a tomato grown in the UK has three times the footprint of a tomato grown in Spain.Lettuces grown in the UK during winter are cultivated in poly tunnels which require\u0026nbsplots of energy to keep them warm. In terms of carbon emissions, it is more environmentally friendly to buy them from Spain during the winter and in the UK during the summer.But food miles do matter if the product has been transported by air. For this reason, Professor Reay says consumers should avoid eating out-of-season soft fruit such as raspberries and blueberries.A 100g box of blueberries\u0026nbspgrown locally or imported via ship will produce around 100g of carbon dioxide. If it’s flown in, that increases by ten times, pushing its carbon footprint up to more like 1kg.Destruction of land must stop to tackle climate change, says reportClimate change could cause toxic mercury to accumulate in seafood“If you want to go into the high carbon footprint foods then once it’s been air freighted you’re in real trouble. That’s when the food miles absolutely soar in terms of emissions. We should have a blanket ban on air freight,” said Professor\u0026nbspReay.Despite the fiendishly difficult business of counting carbon he says the message “buy local” needs to go with “in season”. \u0026nbsp“The food mile message is a little more nuanced than it’s sometimes presented,” he added.Reducing waste would also make a significant difference to the carbon footprint.According to 2017 research, food waste accounts for 8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country it would come behind China and the US as the largest emitters on the planet.Professor Derek Stewart, an agri-food sector expert from the James Hutton Institute, said the book was interesting but some of the data could be challenged, notably on the grounds that it only looked at carbon dioxide emissions.Ships use dirty fuels that emit nitrogen and sulphur as well as carbon dioxide which has a significantly larger greenhouse gas impact than carbon dioxide alone, he said.PMQsProfessor Stewart added: “The carbon footprint is too nebulous for most people and in fact forms only part of a food supply chain.”Dr Eugene Mohareb, a lecturer in sustainable urban systems at the University of Reading, commended the overall analysis of food miles and the impacts of production.“In an ideal world, embodied carbon from production and transport would be communicated to the consumer on food products so that they could make informed decisions. But in the absence of that, eating produce in season can be a good guide,” he said.Food systems contribute to between 20 and 30 per cent of emissions globally and Dr Mohareb says the UK is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 unless these emissions are reduced.“There are many things that we as consumers can do to reduce this impact. For example, we found that a simple measure, such as using grocery delivery instead of collecting by car just half of the time, reduced someone’s total impact on the food system by around half a percentage point,” he said.Eating vegetarian\u0026nbspone day a week could reduce someone’s overall impact by around 4 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years.

On Wall Street the Dow Jones dropped more than 130 points after the opening bell after Goldman Sachs warned of the rising risk of a US recession as trade tensions with China become increasingly hostile.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reality is that any use of a phone distracts from a driver’s ability to pay full attention, and the government should consider extending the ban to reflect this.”RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: “We support the committee’s call for the government to look more closely at the effectiveness of the increase of the penalties in 2017, and key to this is whether enforcement is adequate and whether the police have sufficient resources and technology to be able to crack down on this scourge.”A Department for Transport spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “While mobile phones are a vital part of modern life and business, drivers must always use them safely and responsibly.“Being distracted by a mobile phone while driving is dangerous and puts people’s lives at risk. The law is clear that anyone driving dangerously is committing a criminal offence.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Policymakers have looked for an explanation in the so-called supply side of the economy – the ways in which goods are made and services delivered – and pointed to declining technological innovation and cheap loans keeping unproductive “zombie” firms afloat, among other possible reasons.\u0026nbspBut the New Economics Foundation says its research shows that the government must also look at the demand side – the level and nature of spending across the country.\u0026nbsp“Average productivity, wages and living standards have experienced their worst decade in almost two centuries. It is increasingly clear that weak demand has been the overlooked problem,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the think tank.\u0026nbsp“Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain’s Jamie Chadwick wins first-ever W Series title.

Instead, companies rely on cheaper labour that can be shed quickly if demand doesn’t improve. As a result, productivity does not improve.The New Economics Foundation finds evidence of exactly this in official data.\u0026nbspIt says that since 2012, firms have increasingly preferred to hire rather than to invest and that, relative to all employees, the proportion of zero-hour and self-employed workers, as well as one-person “micro-companies”, has grown by two fifths since before the financial crisis. The corresponding lack of investment now explains at least a quarter of the UK’s gap in productivity with the historical trend.A report by the New Economics Foundation sets out a number of measures to lift demand, including gradual increases in statutory paid holiday and faster rises in the minimum wage.\u0026nbsp“The evidence shows that increased leisure time for workers can be expected to increase economy-wide demand,” the think tank says.It adds: “Increasing minimum wages is a particularly efficient way of boosting demand because workers on minimum wages are far more likely to spend rather than save any increases in salary, compared with higher-income iniduals.”Based on the same logic, the report recommends abolishing the personal allowance of income tax and using the extra public revenue on direct payouts to consumers and an increase in child benefit. It says this will redistribute £8bn a year from the richest 35 per cent of households to the remaining 65 per cent, with most of the gains concentrated on the poorest 10 per cent.\u0026nbspThe think tank also argues the government should frontload a large share of investment required to turn Britain into a zero-carbon economy over the next five years, in order to boost demand.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

an explosion that killed five scientists last week happened during testing of a small nuclear power reactor – as western experts have suspected.The country’s leading nuclear official promised on Monday to succeed in developing new weapons despite the accident in what was thought to have been a failed test of a new missile.Russia’s defence ministry had initially said the explosion, on an offshore platform in the Arkhangelsk region near the Arctic Circle, had happened during testing of a liquid-fuelled rocket engine, and had killed two people.But nuclear agency Rosatom later said several scientists had been killed during testing of an “isotope power source in a liquid propulsion system”.US nuclear experts believe Rosatom may have been testing an experimental nuclear-powered cruise missile, which president Vladimir Putin last year claimed to be “invincible against all existing and prospective” defence systems.Created with Sketch.Huge explosion at Russia ammunition depot:

funeral in Sarov, a high-security city devoted to atomic research less than 250 miles east of Moscow.An official at the Russian Federal Nuclear Centre in Sarov, where the men worked, suggested they had been working on a small nuclear reactor, work “many countries” were doing.Valentin Kostyukov, head of the centre, which is part of Rosatom, said the test had been preceded by a year of careful work and a state commission was investigating what went wrong.The nuclear experts battled to control the situation, but were unable to prevent the accident, Mr Kostyukov said.Vyacheslav Soloviev, scientific director of the institute, said that their part of it was developing small-scale power sources that use “radioactive materials, including fissile and radioisotope materials”.Although the defence ministry initially said no change in radiation was detected after Thursday’s explosion, officials in the nearby city of Severodvinsk said radiation had briefly spiked, which prompted US nuclear experts to suspect the failed test involved a nuclear-powered cruise missile.The experts suspected it was the Burevestnik missile, one of an array of new strategic weapons touted by Mr Putin last year.Norwegian man sentenced to 14 years in jail in Russia for spyingAnxious local residents stocked up on iodine, used to reduce the effects of radiation exposure.Tensions between Moscow and Washington over arms control have been exacerbated by the demise this month of a landmark nuclear treaty.A series of deadly accidents have damaged the Russian military’s reputation, including huge explosions earlier last week at a Siberian depot that killed one person and injured 13.Last month 14 sailors died in a fire aboard a nuclear-powered submarine in the Barents Sea. A top naval official later said the men gave their lives preventing a “planetary catastrophe”.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Arab, explains how he has lost $1000s of dollars being displaced due to the water crisis in Iraq (Photo: Bel Trew)A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.\u0026nbspIn Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C\u0026nbspdays, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.\u0026nbspThe crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid\u0026nbsp– has exacerbated the country’s energy ide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.\u0026nbsp“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off. \u0026nbsp“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”Boiling Basra: Iraq’s water crisis threatens to destabilise the regionIraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.\u0026nbspNearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.\u0026nbspProfessor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.\u0026nbsp“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable iniduals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”\u0026nbspIraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.\u0026nbspAs the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.\u0026nbspLast month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C\u0026nbspin the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings –\u0026nbspand for good reason.\u0026nbspHigh temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.\u0026nbspAs it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.\u0026nbspChildren, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heatThe rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.\u0026nbspBut as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.\u0026nbsp“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”\u0026nbspAnd while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster. \u0026nbspAFPGetty)A 2018,\u0026nbspreport produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C\u0026nbspby 2050.Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C\u0026nbspin August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.\u0026nbsp“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says. \u0026nbspBut despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far.\u0026nbspProtesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.\u0026nbsp“We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous,” Hamed,\u0026nbspsays. “I expect that if the issue isn’t fixed, it will bring down the government.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was standing on a rock area when a powerful wave washed her into the sea.”Turning to her parents Bob and Noeleen Moodliar who were at the hearing, he said: “This is the death of your daughter and a real tragedy to say the least.“I can only hope that over the course of time le becomes a little easier.”Sinead had been staying at a flat owned by her parents in the Umhlanga area after jetting out to spend Christmas in South Africa where she had many friends.The inquest heard how Mr and Mrs Moodliar were in the UK when she died.Father-of-three Mr Moodliar, a Subway takeaway franchise operator, said he last spoke to his daughter on the phone when she was in a restaurant at pm on Christmas Day.He said he received another call on Boxing Day afternoon to say that she had been involved in the accident.Mr Moodliar said his daughter was in a critical, but stable condition after being transferred to Ethekwini Hospital, Durban.He arranged for clinician friends living a short distance away in Durban to visit her and they told him that he and his we should fly out immediately.Mr Moodliar told the hearing that he was initially optimistic that his daughter would survive.But when they arrived at Durban airport, they were told by friends who met them that she had died.Mr Moodliar said a leguard spotted his daughter by a shore wall at .am as he was arriving for work.“At .am, the leguards heard loud screams from the rocks. They were told that Sinead was in the rough water and a rip tide was present.“Three of them went underwater searching for Sinead to no avail. A resident of a fth floor apartment who had an aerial view directed the leguards to where Sinead was around m out.”Mr Moodliar said Sinead had been in the water for around eight minutes and was given CPR by leguards after being brought back to shore.She started breathing again before paramedics arrived and recorded the oxygen levels in her blood improving.Mr Moodliar later spoke to witnesses who told him how she had been swept away.He said: “She was allowing the sea to wash over her feet. She was not swimming. She was standing on a rock.”Mr Moodliar said she was engulfed by the sea and swept out very rapidly.Speaking after the hearing, Mr Moodliar said after the hearing: “We absolutely miss our daughter.

Plants could generate energy in Yorkshire, Cumbria, Lancashire and Cheshire under a project spearheaded by Rolls-Royce for “small modular reactors”. The Government is pumping in £million so the firm can develop the design of the reactors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to formally announce the plan in September and the first plant could be up and running within the next  years. “These new mini nuclear reactors would be concentrated across the North — and plans are in motion to place them in the Sheffield city region, Cumbria, Lancashire and Cheshire,” a Government source told the Times. “Nuclear is clean and a way of reducing the UK’s carbon footprint on a large scale.” The reactors would trigger a jobs bonanza, with , posts expected to be created.    Each power station could generate enough energy to fuel , homes, according to estimates by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Northern Powerhouse Partnership director Henri Murison said: “There is market ready technology available globally which can be put together with the UK supply chain, with us having what is needed to build them here in the Northern Powerhouse alongside investing in a large factory which this support will help us to achieve. “Work undertaken by the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre has shown what can be achieved ensuring that we build up our capabilities and all the resulting economic benefits of the jobs being here in making them. “Our upcoming energy industrial strategy for the Northern Powerhouse will focus heavily on SMRs, fulfilling the promise of when George Osborne back in  committed the funds to establish the UK as a leader in what was then an emerging area globally.” Supporters say nuclear power is clean, efficient and renewable. But critics believe it is too expensive, takes too long to clean up and the risks involved are too great. Rolls-Royce’s website says: “At every point in the development of our UK SMR solution, we have sought to take a modular approach to drive down the cost of electricity to as low as practically possible, whilst at the same time building in multiple layers of fault prevention and protection to make sure the technology is safe in all modes of operation.” But scientist Dr Ian Fairlie, of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: “The grandiose safety claims made about SMRs are reminiscent of  claims about nuclear power in the s when it was said electricity would become too cheap to meter. “SMRs are still vulnerable to nuclear accidents, terror attacks, and can produce more nuclear waste than conventional reactors per unit of electricity.”Sheffield City Region mayor Dan Jarvis said: “The Sheffield City Region is superbly placed to support the development of small modular reactors technology.We can play a leading role in meeting the challenges of climate change while helping to keep the lights on.” French firm EDF is building a £billion nuke plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset.

After two years of planning then a whole year of trekking, Ash Dykes, , finished his expedition yesterday. He became a viral sensation all over China as millions followed his progress on the internet and on TV. In the early stages he was followed for two days by a pack of hungry wolves which had just killed a local woman. The route took him ,ft above sea level and he endured both blizzards and baking heat, with temperatures as low as minus-C and as high as C. Ash, from Old Colwyn in North Wales, said: “It’s an unreal feeling to cross the finish line. It’ll take a while to sink in. But it’s such a special moment – history is created.”    Four of his team dropped out on the first day after suffering extreme altitude sickness and refusing to go ahead for fear of wolf and bear attacks. Ash pressed on with just one guide and a trusty pack horse called Caster Troy. He said: “Before we heard the wolves we filmed the locals speaking to us in a dialect we didn’t really understand. “It was only  months later that our editor was going through the footage and said they were telling us not to go into the valley because a woman had been killed by wolves the day before.”  At ious stages Ash was joined by Chinese social media influencers who kept their followers updated on his trek. He said: “One guy joined me to livestream and we had more than .million viewers. The comments were coming so fast you couldn’t read any of the questions. “People in China have been amazed to see parts of their country they have never seen before, especially the people in the cities.”  He added: “This has been more than a personal achievement it is unlocking human potential. While every corner of the planet is occupied by people, there are still things that haven’t been done. “It has been far from just a challenging journey – it’s been a cultural one too.” Ash used the publicity he attracted to highlight conservation projects by organisations including the World Wildle Fund and the Green Development Fund, and he recorded the amount of plastic and pollution he saw along the way.    He said: “The good news is that I’ve seen a huge increase in knowledge and understanding within the communities, towns and cities along the way. “People are aware of the damage being caused to their water sources and are now actively changing their ways for the better. It’s inspiring to see.” To finance his trip, Ash won sponsorship from sunglasses and camera firms and launched his own “AD” range of outdoor wear with Kailas, a Chinese clothing giant.

Tired of spending four hours commuting from Kildare to the Dublin everyday, the couple made the le-changing decision to move island which has been abandoned since .Lesley told the Irish Sunday Mirror : “I have always been interested in the Great Blasket Islands - I wrote my thesis about their heritage.“As part of my research Gordon and I went out there and we stayed in one of the cottages.“We just fell in love with the place and in January I saw a Facebook post advertising a job looking after the hostel there.“I had been working in the heritage sector at a Seamus Heaney exhibition and Gordon was in the civil service at the time. “I loved my work but we both wanted a bit of a change and a break from our routine so we decided to go for it and  days later we got the job.”  The island has no electricity or hot water, and they have to rely on gas to cook their food. Lesley added: “There’s a wind turbine which powers a socket so we have one socket for the whole place – it wouldn’t be powerful enough to run a hoover or anything but it can charge my phone. “I can take bookings for the hostel on that and send in our shopping lists – we couldn’t do without it. “I still walk into a room sometimes and think, ‘It’s very dark in here’ and go to turn on the light, then remember I can’t. “The lack of electricity hasn’t actually bothered me that much but it did take me a while to get used to not having hot water. “I said I was going to heat up water every day, that I’d never have a cold shower – but to be honest you’d be upstairs and dressed by the time you’d have the water heated in the kettle so I just decided to brave it.”The island was abandoned in  as emergency services had dficulty accessing the mainland in times of bad weather . Lesley said: You just have to be prepared and hope that nothing goes wrong. “Sometimes we are cut off from the mainland for three or four days. “We just have to be mindful of that and not take any chances, we take it easy when we’re lting chairs and tables in the house and things like that.” The couple, who supervise a hostel on the island, said they are never lonely because they always have visitors. Lesley said: “We can have up to  people in the accommodation, boats come out from Dingle, Bantry and Dunquin. “Thenthe weather is bad it’s just us but that’s actually our favourite time. All you can hear is the beach and the waves. That’s when we really get to appreciate the island and landscape and what the islanders would have went through when they were living here.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeffrey epstein 300 brits named","story":"NewsJeffrey Epstein:  Brits named in FBI dossier on Prince Andrews paedophile palEXCLUSIVE: Following his prison suicide, the child abusers many ties to the UK - most notably with the Duke of York - have been investigated by US officialsShareByChristopher Bucktin:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video jeffrey-epstein-killed-himself-prison-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe FBI’s ,-page ­dossier on Prince Andrew’s paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein includes details of  British associates from the pervert’s address book. FBI agents raided Epstein’s private US Virgin Island, dubbed “paedophile island”, yesterday as the sex-trafficking probe continued, despite his apparent suicide, aged , on Saturday. US officials have also vowed to carry on probing Epstein’s ties to the UK amid fears about his offending overseas. And MPs are calling for an investigation into the Duke of York’s relationship with Epstein. Virginia Giuffre claims she was a victim of sex trafficking by Epstein and “loaned” to Prince Andrew for sex three times, which he vehemently denies. Labour MP Jess Phillips, who sits on the Women and Equalities Committee, said: “I think that, of course, the case must be properly investigated.” She said it was especially important as Prince Andrew, , “still appears to have some role as an envoy for the UK government”. He stood down as a trade envoy in  amid criticism of his links with Epstein.     Ms Phillips added: “No one is assuming guilt, but the Epstein case and evidence does mean that we have a duty to undertake a proper investigation. “We are talking about the trafficking of children, this is very serious and authorities should learn from the past in ignoring such allegations.” Labour backbencher and committed Republican Emma Dent Coad said: “Nobody should be above the law andthere is a case to answer then whoever it is should answer it.” Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said the prince had questions to answer. He said: “He has been accused by a credible witness of keeping her as a sex slave when she was a child. “He is allegedly among many alleged co-conspirators in a child trafficking operation led by Epstein. It was likely that Epstein would have claried who  was involved and now his victims will never know. “Prince Andrew must give a full account of his relationship with Epstein and answer accusations levelled against him.” US investigators who looked at Epstein’s “little black book” found almost half of it read like a who’s who of British society. His  British contacts had more than , numbers and dozens of email addresses between them.    There is no suggestion the presence of their names in the book means any are accused of any wrongdoing or even met Epstein in person. The contacts included celebrities such as Mick Jagger, Simon Le Bon, the late Sir David Frost, Richard Branson, Naomi Campbell, Tamara Beckwith, Jonathan Dimbleby, Loyd Grossman and numerous lords and ladies.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is recorded once, while his former cabinet minister Lord Peter Mandelson has  numbers, including one marked “direct line” one for “home” and another for “country home”.There are  numbers for Prince Andrew, including a mobile number, one marked “Palace ex-directory”, one for Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence, where the Prince invited Epstein, and one marked “Sand”, for Sandringham, another royal retreat where he spent time. Epstein also recorded  numbers for Prince Andrew’s former we Sarah Ferguson, who took £, off the paedophile to help pay off her debts.    Federal prosecutors and FBI agents who built the case against Epstein have turned their attention to people his accusers claim were involved in his scheme to sexually exploit dozens of underage girls. It includes a circle of associates who victims claim helped recruit, train and coerce them. One document is said to describe in detail the “damning things” Epstein’s inner circle did as he abused more than  girls from across the world. A source said: “The document entails everybody in the Epstein case. It has some damning things, including about a number of Brits.” The ex-Wall Street financier flew “sex slave” Giuffre, formerly known as Roberts, to London in , when she was just . While in the capital, she was pictured with the then -year-old Prince Andrew inside the home of British socialite ­Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre claims she was “lent out” to the prince for sex in London and on two other occasions. Buckingham Palace has issued an “emphatic” denial, saying: “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue. “It is emphatically denied that the Duke had any form of sexual contact or relationship with [then] Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.”  US Attorney General William Barr said yesterday that there were “serious irregularities” at the federal prison in New York City where Epstein died. And he vowed that the investigation into Epstein’s sex crimes would continue. Barr, the top US law enforcement official, said: “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy.” His comments came in a speech to the Grand Lodge Fraternal Order of Police’s National Biennial Conference. Barr said the criminal case against Epstein was personally important to him. He said the financier’s death had denied victims the chance to confront Epstein in a courtroom. Barr said: “I was appalled – and indeed the whole department was – and frankly angry to learn of the politan Correctional Center’s failure to adequately secure this prisoner. “We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a ­thorough investigation.” The decision by officials at the Bureau of Prisons not to keep Epstein on suicide watch even after he was found semi-conscious with neck wounds in July has come under scrutiny. The prison where Epstein died is run by the federal Bureau of Prisons, a ision of the US Justice Department.

Shaun Winstanley, , from Staining near Blackpool, Lancashire, had worked at the supermarket giant for  years and won several awards including Years of Outstanding Service. But the father-of-three was left devastated after he was sacked from his role as a customer assistant at Tesco Express following an investigation meeting on January  this year. Mr Winstanley was told the decision was made because of the “unreasonable behaviour” of chasing a shoplter and putting himself and a customer in danger on January . Despite appealing the decision, Tesco kept their decision on February  and he was sacked. Following his appeal and subsequent dismissal, Mr Winstanley told a friend that he was having suicidal thoughts.    A few days later, he was found dead at home after suffocating himself by police officers who forced entry on February , an inquest heard. Mr Winstanley had a history of mental health problems which became worse when he was held at gunpoint during a robbery in May last year. The inquest was told how his fragile mental state further deteriorated following the sacking until his eventual death sometime between February  and February  - nine months after the gunpoint incident. Speaking after the hearing at Blackpool Town Hall, his devastated step-daughter Siobhan Winstanley, , told how she had written to Tesco about her father’s death but was told the matter was closed. She said: “It is very raw and very dficult for us to come to terms with. “He was of the very strong opinion that [suicide] was a selfish thing to do, so obviously it’s not something he would have done lightly, knowing he had children. “It’s not something that’s actually sunk in. We feel maybewe go into the Highfield Road shop he’s going to be there. But he’s not going to be there, because he’s not here any more. “I am angry at Tesco. We have got our father in an urn in our living room. “I sit there every morning with my coffee and look at him and wonder maybethings had been dferent he would still be here. “I think there needs to be an awareness of mental health and I think employers need to be doing right by their employees. “I could try to take them [Tesco] to tribunal but anything they could give me wouldn’t be good enough. It would be blood money. I don’t want money. I want my dad back. “Seventeen years he gave them and when he needed them most they let him down. “After  years, they sent him off without even a ‘bye’.”  Siobhan said her dad was offered five counselling sessions following the traumatic armed robbery in May last year and also moved stores, from Highfield Road Tesco Express - where the robbery took place - to shops in Bispham and Poulton. But his mental health continued to deteriorate and was made worse by the fact that he was disciplined for missing three shts following the crime, she said.

George Hobbs was placed on the list for urgent surgery after a specialist finally diagnosed the black horn-like growth was actually skin cancer - that had been sprouting out of the top of his head for nine months. The -year-old was taken to hospital after a nasty fall on the day of his weaposs funeral last August, but when the cut on his head was healing, the huge growth developed. George ignored the swelling lump until February, when the pain became so much he went to his GP, who sent him home with paracetamol, despite having a black, egg-sized lump on his scalp.    The retired civil servantaposs GP surgery sent him home with painkillers three times before he was finally referred to a hospital. He died on July  and his grieving daughter Clare Hobbs, , now wants to know why he was never prescribed medication and why it took medics so long to help her father. She said: There have been failures on a lot of peopleaposs parts. Towards the end heaposd spend a lot of time lying down as thataposs when it was at its least painful. He hardly went out because he was embarrassed. He filed all his documents and when I went through them after his death I found a note which read aposplease help me itaposs so painfulapos. That was heartbreaking. I just want someone to take responsibility. He was miserable and he did not deserve that. In May, George, from Gillingham, Kent, said he went to his local doctors, twice before he was sent to a specialist. He said: I saw a dferent doctor the second time and they took one look at it and told me it was too bad for them to deal with. The next I knew I had a call from the plastic surgery department at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead.    He slipped in his daughteraposs bathroom last August and cut his head open, and after patching him up, doctors sent him home. The wound gradually grew in size, and when he eventually went to the doctor it was the size of an egg and growing. After the doctor sent him home with painkillers, he said, he tried to deal with it as best he could, but the lump kept getting larger and more painful. He claimed the advice was repeated at two further visits until a new doctor sent him to see dermatology experts at the Community Living Health Centre in Gillingham, who referred him to Queen Victoria Hospital. The hospital arranged for Mr Hobbs to see a specialist during a weekly visit to Medway Maritime Hospital. The grandfather-of-three said he was later told by a specialist that he urgently needed to go under the kne. Earlier this year, he said: Iaposm furious that they didnapost take this seriously to start with. Itaposs really causing me a lot of discomfort. The specialist at Medway told me I should never have been told to take paracetamol for it. They were amazed it had been allowed to get this bad and said I should have been sent to them immediately. George, who had also been recovering from bladder cancer, was worried about going under the kne again.

It was meant to repel the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and as such dates back to the early th century. But a complete refurbishment in  has seen the property scoop a number of architectural and design awards, with English Heritage labelling the renovation as “exemplary”.    It has been described as one of the most original and soul-stirring modern homes in Britain - and it could be yours for a cool £.million. The three-bedroom home has a completely re-sculpted interior which perfectly blends period features with modern, contemporary architecture. It even has a modern-day drawbridge as well as a wrap-around roof terrace so buyers can take in that stunning seaside view, which is classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Inside, there are two elegant spiral staircases and a rustic, cosy atmosphere by the log-burner. Each of the three bedrooms fits between the inner funnel wall and outer curved wall, while lightwells and skylights are found throughout the property.    The roof extension, in the words of designer Duncan Jackson, “echoes the sculptural interior of vaulted brickwork creating a congruency between the contemporary and historic”.

Students will also face a p levy on bottles of water and single-use plastic cups when the academic year starts to discourage use of the products. The collegeaposs new Warden, Professor Frances Corner, said staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words.    But the National Farmersapos Unionsaid the move was an overly simplistic approach and said there was a lack of understanding or recognition between British beef and beef produced where. Goldsmiths Studentsapos Union has backed the ban with president Joe Leam saying that the university has a huge carbon footprint and that the promise to eradicate this in the next few years is needed. There are also plans to install more solar  across the collegeaposs campus in New Cross, south-east London and switch to a % clean energy supplier as soon as possible. Officials said Goldsmiths will also continue to invest in its allotment area and identy other places where planting could help to absorb carbon dioxide.

Prof Corner said: The growing global call for organisations to take seriously their responsibilities for halting climate change is impossible to ignore. Though I have only just arrived at Goldsmiths, it is immediately obvious that our staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that they are determined to help deliver the step change we need to cut our carbon footprint drastically and as quickly as possible.    Declaring a climate emergency cannot be empty words. I truly believe we face a defining moment in global history and Goldsmiths now stands shoulder to shoulder with other organisations willing to call the alarm and take urgent action to cut carbon use. NFU vice-president Stuart Roberts told PA that the union has been encouraging public bodies, such as universities to back British farming and source locally-produced food. Tackling climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time but singling out one food product is clearly an overly simplistic approach, he said. The main issue with this is the lack of understanding or recognition between British beef and beef produced where. Our standards of beef production in the UK are among the most efficient in the world, with British livestock grazing in extensive, grass-based systems - meaning a greenhouse gas footprint . times smaller than the global average. Anyone wanting to play their part in helping our planet amid the current climate change challenge weaposre all facing should buy British, locally produced beef reared to some of the highest and environmentally sustainable standards in the world. The NFU has for years been encouraging public bodies such as schools and universities to back British farming and source their produce locally wherever possible. This makes more sense and keeps the choice to eat tasty, sustainably-produced meat firmly on the menu.

She heard about healthcare services being provided in Guinea by Mercy Ships, a hospital ship charity which cares for the poor.    She travelled  miles to Conakry with her sister-in-law and infant son for help. After meeting with the patient selection team, Isatu was approved for surgery onboard the Africa Mercy. Dr Gary Parker, the head maxillofacial surgeon onboard the Africa Mercy, said tumours like Isatuaposs are usually benign and not cancerous, but you can die. He added: You can suffocate to death because the tumour pushes your tongue back into your throat until you can no longer keep your airway open. Due to the size and placement of the tumour, though, she had to undergo three surgical procedures to remove the cancer, rebuilt her jaw, and smooth out her skin.  The procedure to remove the cancer, in September, lasted five hours, during which she had a titanium jaw fitted and stayed on the wards to recover. Just three months later, she ed to the theatre to have the titanium jaw replaced with a permanent bone-grafted jaw, the graft taken from her iliac crest.

Bo Rakching is just  years old and still has physique of a child. She stands at the same height as her brother, Chea, , and other youngsters her age. But she has the appearance of premature ageing, likely to be caused by  lipodystrophy or cutis laxa - a rare degenerative condition. Bo has never received treatment and is taunted by the other children in her remote village on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.    Relatives and local monks have lead Bo to believe that her appearance is because of bad karma she is carrying from a past le - one of the fundamental teachings of Buddhism. Bo said that when she rides her bike the other kids yell old folk at her, while even her siblings call her grandma instead of sister. The youngster now dreams of having plastic surgery to make her pretty. Footage shows Bo speaking to a local monk who agrees with her that she has still not cleared the bad path from her le. Askedshe feels shy and embarrassed, she says yes but admits she has never asked her mother for treatment.    She said: I want the pretty face. I want to have surgery. The other children call me aposold folkapos. Among all my brothers and sisters, I am the only one with an old face. They all have young faces. They do not call me sister, they call me grandma. Bo said that she has asked them to stop calling her names but they continue to taunt her. The monk, who confirmed she is  years old and studies at the local school in Grade , encourages her to stand up to the bullies. But the devout Buddhist, named Voeun, told her that her appearance is down to a bad path from a previous le which is still haunting her to this day. In the video, Bo appears to agree and says that she was shot in a previous le and has not cleared the bad path yet.

I played with him for years and years, and I know how good a player he was then. He’s still got that burst of pace, he’s still got the movement, the mentality and he is a leader on the pitch,” he said.“It’s going to be dficult to keep him quiet but we’ve got ways and means to do that.

defeat in Croatia, the Reds were looking to get back to winning ways, but Ilkay Durmus# early goal in Paisley denied them.Derek McInnes’ team never really got their attack going and were found to be vulnerable on the break in damp conditions.The rampant optimism of a week ago, after they’d beaten Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere and then Hearts at Pittodrie, has been dimmed, and they’ll need to improve across the board to have any chance of overturning the Croatian Cup winners’ - first leg lead and keep their hopes of the Euro group stage alive.McInnes made four changes from the team which lost - to Rijeka.Shay Logan, who handed Rijeka a penalty by pulling back Luka Capan, was dropped for new Bristol City loanee Zak Vyner, who made his first appearance.With one eye on Thursday’s , McInnes freshened up the attack with Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and league debutant Curtis Main in for Jon Gallagher, Niall McGinn and Sam Cosgrove – although there were questions marks as to whether Cosgrove’s absence was due to muscle tightness.St Mirren had the first chance to threaten on  minutes from a free-kick after Greg Leigh  bundled Paul McGinn to the deck on the right of the box.Durmus’ initial left-footed effort hit Funso Ojo in the wall, before Tony Andreu’s tame effort from  yards was caught easily by Joe Lewis.However, the home side opened the scoring on  minutes.Greg Leigh got caught out of position after a poor clearing header, with McGinn setting Kyle Magennis free down the right.He squared to the Durmus, who broke into the area and finished into the bottom right corner.It could’ve been two on  minutes. Calum Waters cross from the left headed over by Durmus.Main blazed a shot over from outside the area with  minutes played, having shrugged Gary Mackenzie off in the visitors’ first effort.The Dons interchanging midfield four of Wright, Ryan Hedges, Lewis Ferguson and McLennan wasn’t quite clicking for all their energy, with the man in possession being crowded out.Up the other end, big striker Jon Obika looked a real handful, with his pace, strength and aggression occupying Andy Considine and Scott McKenna.However, Hedges did find space to fire into Vaclav Hladky’s hands from  yards on  minutes, before Ferguson shot miles wide with a free-kick from  yards.Despite building a bit of pressure towards the end of the period, no more real chances materialised.Conversely, an  Andreu free-kick and Durmus overhead kick could’ve extended Saints’ lead, but were both caught by Lewis.Soon after play restarted, Main turned well with the ball and almost found the top left corner from range.On  minutes, Vyner got forward and delivered a pinpoint cross on to Ferguson’s head, and Hladky tipped over the bar.Three minutes later, the keeper threw himself on a deflected McLennan strike. However, he appeared to lt his hands from the ball, which Main stole and rolled into the net.Referee Steven McLean didn’t allow the equaliser – which would’ve been contentious – to stand.But it was a decent spell for Aberdeen, with Hladky punching a whipped Hedges free-kick clear soon after, before Sean McLoughlin looked to handle another of the attacker’s deliveries into the middle.Vyner was booked for protesting too vocerously for a penalty.Gaffer McInnes sent the rested Niall McGinn and Jon Gallagher on for McLennan and Wright in an attempt to force the issues for the Reds.But, on  minutes, St Mirren could’ve scored again, but Andreu somehow flicked Paul McGinn’s cross past the post.Ryan Flynn then went close with  minutes to go, ghosting inside, but shooting straight at Considine as he tried to find the inside of the front post.Kyle McAllister was next to try for the home side, and his long-range effort narrowly missed the top left corner.James Wilson was sent on for the Dons as they threw everything at the quick-countering Buddies to try and level it.The big chance of a frantic finish fell to substitute McGinn, from Considine’s cross, but he struck the outside of the post on the angle at the death."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d510305d933b7.48651057-423x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen fc lodges complaint over treatment of supporters in croatia","story":"Aberdeen FC has lodged a complaint after supporters spoke of “shocking” treatment on a European away day as fans were caged.Dons fans travelled to Croatia on Thursday to watch their side play in the Europa League qualier and complained of being forced to pay £ on-the-spot fines in what one source described as an “organised scam”.Others complained the visitors’ enclosure resembled a cage, toilet facilities were “medieval” and fans were not allowed to leave for half an hour after full-time.The host club has denied fans were treated improperly.Dons officials said they gave extensive written advice to all travelling supporters about the anticipated conditions at Stadion Rujevica in Rijeka – but were still surprised at how they claimed to have been treated.“We complained to the Croatian police and to the Rijeka FC stewards regarding the treatment of our fans,” said an Aberdeen FC spokesman.The stadium is being used temporarily while Rijeka’s new ground is being built.Before Dandies supporters jetted out to Croatia, Aberdeen wrote to them advising about ground regulations, including banned objects and alcohol regulations.However, supporters arrived and had hayfever tablets and even lipstick confiscated.One Dons fan, who asked not to be named, said: “The policing was far too heavy-handed.“I saw fans get things like lighters and lipstick taken away and one wee boy had hayfever pills taken away because they were classed as drugs.“The conditions were shocking. We were placed in a cage and there were only two basic portable toilets for everyone to use and no washing facilities. It was really medieval. A lot of the fans were upset.“At least five fans were apprehended and finedfor being drunk.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust. Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

Ardrishaig Bothy was open and help was on hand to introduce youngsters to riding a bike, or brush up on their cycle control skills. There was also a unique opportunity to join the th Duke of Argyll on a walking tour of the Crinan Canal as he uncovered the Chronicles of Crinan, butthat was too energetic then there was the option of sitting back to be entertained.Mid Argyll Pipe Band took time off from competition to play to the crowds. They joined some local bands who made sure toes were tapping from early morning until the end of the day.Of course, the main event was the ribbon cutting to formally open the Egg Shed and let the crowd who had gathered in Pier Square get a first look at the much-anticipated new building. Scottish Canals Chief Executive Catherine Topley together with Chief Executive of Argyll and Bute Council Cleland Sneddon addressed the crowd before enlisting the help of some young local helpers to help cut the ribbon and allow the first guests to flood in.As well as learning more about ‘Britain’s most beautul shortcut’, and its souvenir shop, the Egg Shed hosts a multi-purpose community space, free for the local community to use, which has a multitude of uses. It currently hosts an exhibition of Crinan Canal paintings by artist Richard Demarko, who when asked how he would describe them said they were: ‘a love letter to the Crinan Canal.’Mid Argyll Councillor Dougie Philand attended the launch and said: #It was a very well organised event and well attended. It sends out the signal that not only Scottish Canals but other partners are interested and are now investing in Ardrishaig.

I would like to congratulate everyone who helped to make it a professional and successful day. Everyone involved played their part in a professional manner.#I hope this is an important part of the regeneration of Mid Argyll and I will continue to give them all my support in my duties as a councillor.#The Egg Shed is the latest marker in the regeneration of Ardrishaig Harbour and has already been taken to the community’s heart.

wedding parties, but not guests, in their mansion.The owners, Michael and Stephanie Goddard bought the th century house in , before spending around pound.m renovating the property and grounds.The Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from neighbours.One condition, that the planning permission was only valid for two years, was removed on appeal but the condition that only two rooms can be rented out in the mansion at a time has remained in place.The most recent application, submitted by Lanark-based Burrel Design Studios on behalf of the Goddards, seeks to lt this condition and allow guests to stay in the mansions year-round.A supporting statement accompanying the application reads: ldquoThe effect of the councilrsquos ruling means that year-round self-catering accommodation may legitimately be offered in the lodge, the white house and penthouse, and the rights bestowed under the planning acts mean that year-round bed and breakfast accommodation may be offered for a maximum of two bedrooms within Hartree House.ldquoHowever, planning permission would be requiredthree or more bedrooms within Hartree House were occupied by guests.ldquoOver the last  years, the current owners of Hartree House have rescued the historic structure from being a building lsquoat riskrsquo to being a fully restored historic building incorporating some contemporary elements, which have served to reconcile former unsympathetic

will add signicantly to the attraction of Hartree as a venue and will assist towards the upkeep of the house and grounds.A castle, known as Hartree Tower, was present on the site by at least the th century, but was demolished in the late th century by Colonel Alexander Dickson, who rebuilt the current Hartree House in its place.In , the property was passed to Elizabeth Dickson after her brother

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

He retired from the House of Lords in , but his lelong interest in and passion for politicsremains intact. And he is as engaged in the principal issue of the day as the rest of us. Not that he is any clearer as to what is going to happen.ldquoItrsquos very dficult to predict what this Prime Minister will do because he has said so many dferent things. He talks about leaving at any cost. He talks about there being a one-in-a-million chance of a No Deal Brexit. I donrsquot think he knows. I donrsquot think anybody knows. I think wersquore flying blind and I think that is deeply dangerous for the country.And how does he feel about that  ldquoExasperation and anger and in a sense, fear. Not for me. Irsquom  and Irsquom comparatively prosperous. One of the things that irks me particularly about leaving the Community is that it wonrsquot be people like me who will suffer. It will be people at the bottom of the heap. It will be the disadvantaged and the dispossessed. It will be generations in -or--yearsrsquo time. We are mortgaging the future of the least well off, and thatrsquos alien to all I believe in.And where in all this does his own party stand  Whither Labour  Does he know  ldquoNo. One of my complaints is we have failed to adopt a serious position over the great issue of our time, perhaps the great issue of the century where Britainrsquos future lies. Our party doesnrsquot have a firm position in either direction.Note that ldquowe. Hattersley remains a Labour man through and through. He is probably best known for his time as the partyrsquos deputy leader through the s when Neil Kinnock was trying tothe party to power during the Thatcher years. He was always seen to be on the right of the party, although today he declares himself a ldquoradical socialist. And he was critical of the Blair government at the turn of the century. The question today is what he feels about the party now.Later this week he is in Scotland to tell us. He is appearing at the Edinburgh International Book Festival to talk about the future of the party he has served for so long. What hersquos actually going to say, though, hersquos slightly reluctant to tell me.ldquoThere are a number of things the Labour party has to do to recover and get itself back into the mainstream of politics, he argues. ldquoBut Irsquom not going to tell you what they are. Otherwise, no one will come.For a few minutes we circle around the subject. Is the leadership part of the problem, I ask  ldquoYes. And I shall deal with that.Can that be changed  ldquoYou are going into forbidden territory, he says, laughing.Well, would it be fair to say that Corbynism is a kind of mirror image of Blairism, both movements in their own way deeply inimical to what the Labour party should stand for ldquoNo. I had very many reservations about New Labour because I am a radical socialist and Irsquom not sure they were. I believe in equality and Irsquom not sure they did. Some people will blame Corbynism on New Labour and the Third Way, but I donrsquot believe they are responsible for it. I believe that Blairrsquos was a good government that made one terrible mistake with Iraq. But, my word,Tony was leading the Labour party now, I think it would look very dferent.The ultimate question that must be asked, I suggest, is what Labour stands for now. ldquoYou are asking the fundamental question Irsquom addressing on Thursday. What is the Labour party for  And Irsquom going to say we havenrsquot made it clear what wersquore for. We were always, since our foundation, reluctant to talk about the principles, the ideology. Wersquod just rather get on with it. And now is a time when we have to define what we are for, what we are about.Whatever his opinion of the current Labour leadershipHattersley thinks there is no shortage of talent on the Labour benches. ldquoThe parliamentary party is more full of talent than any time in my political experience. Night after night you put Newsnight or Channel  News on and some backbencher yoursquove never heard of ndash quite often a young woman ndash will speak with immense ability, grasp, confidence, understanding. The parliamentary Labour party is full of people of very high quality. They need to say what we stand for.When it comes to Scotland, he is, as you might expect, a Unionist. ldquoBut I understand part of the reason for Scottish nationalism. And part of the reason is not just the desire for independence. Itrsquos that the Scottish National Party filled the radical vacuum that was in part left by Blairism. The Labour party lost some of its radical edge and the SNP took over. So,we had a genuinely radical Labour party ndash not an extreme Labour party ndash I think Labour would do much better than it is doing in Scotland.That may be wishful thinking on his part. But then, as he says, he can recall a time when Scotland had no Tory MPs. Hattersleyrsquos political le covers most of the post-war period and the sht from welfare state consensus to the confused, atomised, political present. He was born in  and served as the MP for Birmingham Sparkbrook from  to .He also had, as politicians of his era did, a hinterland. Hattersley has also been a successful writer. In his last book, Catholics, published two years ago, he revealed that his mother Enid OrsquoHara, ran away with a priest, Frederick Hattersley, two weeks after he had officiated at her wedding to another man. Itrsquos a remarkable revelation. Did learning his fatherrsquos story change how he looked back on his own le, I wonder  He thinks not.ldquoI wish I had known about it because my father and I were very close. But he was a very self-effacing, retiring, shy sort of man and I would have liked to known about this heroic moment in his le when he did this, in my view, wonderful thing. And it makes me unhappy because I think he didnrsquot tell me because he thought I would be ashamed of him. In fact, I would have been very proud of him and I wish I had known about it.When he was  Hattersley read a book about equality and it changed his le. Politics suddenly seemed a worthy ambition. The frustration may be that, after serving in the Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan governments in the late s and through the s, he spent the rest of his political career in opposition as Labour toiled during the s and early s.What he did achieve in that time was to see off Militant, one of the things, Hattersley says, he feels most proud of. ldquoFor two or three years, two or three of us, two of us really, John Smith and me, spent our time going around the country saying the Labour party is better than it sounds. Speaking out for the real Labour party in the country. And somebody needs to do that again.

McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda. And almost exactly five years since the last one."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-msps-urge-leonard-stand-uk-leadership","story":"The Scottish leader will face his rebellious Holyrood group at the partyrsquos Glasgow HQ as he tries to show he still retains a modicum of authority.A party source said: ldquoThis is going to be a tense meeting and MSPs will plead for Richard and his team to stand up to the Corbyn Project and dissuade them from writing off Scottish Labour.ldquoTherersquos a great deal of distress within the group about the partyrsquos future, but the biggest concern is what the cost of this could be for the future of the UK.:Labours Tom Watson: Scottish indyref is not the answerAnother predicted MSPs would ldquolet off steam, but that, as in other meetings led by Mr Leonard, the party would not decide on any specic course of action.Mr Leonard was humiliated last week after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell unilaterally rewrote Scottish Labour policy on another independence vote at the Edinburgh Fringe.Despite Mr Leonard saying in March that a UK Labour government would refuse to allow Indyref, evenHolyrood demanded it, Mr McDonnell twice said that was not the case.ldquoThatrsquos up to the Scottish people and the Scottish Parliament. Irsquom not into blocking democratic exercises by any means, he said, adding Jeremy Corbyn thought so too.With a general election likely soon, the comment was seen as extending an olive branch to Nicola Sturgeon in case SNP MPs are needed to sustain a minority Labour government at Westminster.The First Minister yesterday said it was ldquoa refreshing change to Mr McDonnell ldquorecognise and accept that it is the Scottish Parliament and people who should decide on Indyref.But Mr McDonnellrsquos intervention unleashed a wave of party infighting, with most Labour MSPs saying they ldquodeplore any attempts to undermine Scottish Labourrsquos position.They said on Thursday: ldquoWe are clear Labourrsquos position on Scotlandrsquos future is a decision for Scottish Labour, which the UK party must accept.In a further blow to Mr Leonardrsquos standing, it then emerged the statement was issued against his express wishes by the chair of Labour MSPs, Jackie Baillie.Mr Leonard, a strong supporter of Mr Corbyn who has failed to repeat his March position since Mr McDonnellrsquos comments, had wanted to avoid a confrontation with London.On Friday, Scottish Labour general secretary Brian Roy quit with immediate effect, amid reports he had been ousted as Mr Corbynrsquos office takes greater control of the Scottish operation.Mr Leonard, who has been leader since November , was also reported to have lost confidence in Mr Roy after Scottish Labour crashed to  per cent of the vote in Mayrsquos European election.Although todayrsquos ldquoaway-day in Glasgow was arranged long before the current crisis, MSPs are expected to use it to push Mr Leonard not to let Scottish Labour regain its ldquobranch office tag.The Scottish partyrsquos precarious finances, and its reliance on London for cash, are also expected to come up.:Most people in UK would grant second referendum by , poll findsSources said MSPs were mainly angry at the UK leadership, not Mr Leonard, but he still had to get on the front foot.One MSP said the ldquoclumsiness and disregard with which Mr McDonnell had treated the Scottish party was as bad as his message on the Union.There is also renewed focus on Lesley Laird, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, who as a member of the shadow cabinet should take the same line as Mr McDonnell, but as Mr Leonardrsquos deputy would also be expected to take the same stand as the Scottish leader.Labour peer Lord Foulkes, a former MSP, yesterday admitted he had told Ms Laird to her face that he thought ldquoalmost anyone would be better than her.SNP MSP Keith Brown said: ldquoScottish Labour are an utter shambles.

And so, hersquos thinking a new pro-yes party could bring in more regional list votes for the cause.On the face of it, the theory seems sound. The Holyrood electoral system was set up with the aim of making it dficult for any one party to get a majority which means a party that performs well in the first-past-the-post seats will find it harder to make gains on the regional lists.:Jim Sillars: Wings over Scotland plan for a new party could \"split\" pro-indy voteYou can see this from the last election. The SNP did well in the list vote, but because it also did well on first-past-the-post, it was the other, mainly unionist parties that picked up the list MSPs. Mr Campbellrsquos idea is that a Wings party could change this by taking some of the list votes that are being ldquowasted on the SNP, therefore increasing the chances of a Yes majority.But the theory has over-looked two important factors. First, the SNP wonrsquot stand for it. At the last election, they ran a ldquoBoth votes SNP campaign based on the theory thatthey lost some first-past-the-post seats, they could pick up seats on the regional list ndash and that was despite the fact there were other pro-independence parties standing on the list, such as Rise and the Greens. Adding another party based on Wings is not going to change that.Second, Mr Campbellrsquos theory is based on the idea the SNP will broadly retain the number of first-past-the-post seats they have at the moment, but thatrsquos far from certain. Whether we like it or not, the next Scottish election will be fought on a single issue ndash whether the pro-Yes parties should be given a majority to demand another referendum ndash and in that scenario many,not most, supporters of the union will vote tactically against the SNP, and that means the party could lose some first-past-the-post seats. Combined with losing list votes to Wings, this could put a pro-independence majority at risk.There are also particular problems with a party based on the Wings brand, the main one being its aggressive image. Mr Campbellrsquos traditional response to this has effectively been ldquochill, itrsquos just banter but the SNP leadership knows the more aggressive nationalists have damaged the cause in the past and a party based on Wings would only heighten the problem. Yes, any Wings party would only be an outer limb of the Yes movement, but political poison could spread quickly through the bloodstream.:Labours Tom Watson: Scottish indyref is not the answerThe Wings party would also do something  damaging: it would draw attention to the dis-satisfaction within the Yes movement ndash indeed, the ision appears to be one of the reasons Mr Campbell is considering starting up the party in the first place.In his blog discussing the idea for example, Mr Campbell said SNP supporters didnrsquot want to vote for ldquoextreme radical fringe parties like the Greens because they donrsquot want to ldquofill womenrsquos changing rooms and toilets with male rapists. This, of course, is a reference to his opposition to the proposals to allow trans people to identy their own gender, but itrsquos only one of the SNP policies he dislikes.You might say: who cares about these disagreements over policy as long as everyone agrees on the bigger aim of independence  But part of the success of the yes movement in  in growing so rapidly was that the dferent groupings more or less fell in behind Alex Salmond. A new Wings party, on the other hand, could provide a mouthpiece to those within the independence movement who are unhappy with Nicola Sturgeon over a range of issues: among them, trans rights, the timing of a second referendum, and the swing towards austerity, as some see it, that was signalled with the Growth Commission. If the yes movement is, and looks, ided ndash particularly over the economy ndash voters will fear a Brexit-style debacle and will be more likely to vote no.And, finally, we have the image problem: what would a Wings Over Scotland party actually look and sound like  Famously, David Cameron once dismissed UKIP as a bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists and therersquos a real danger that a Wings party would attract people from the extremities of the independence movement in a similar way.You know the ones I mean. The ones who are blatantly anti-English. The ones whose arms ache from waving saltires. The ones who believe Mr Campbell didnrsquot really lose the defamation case against Kezia Dugdale. And the ones who suggested that the women who accused Alex Salmond of sexual assault might have ldquothrown themselves at him. Presumably some of this bunch would stand for the Wings party and what a sight that would make.I appreciate, of course, that none of this may happen in the end, but the success Mr Campbell has made of his blog would suggest therersquos a decent chance of him making a success of a party too.The problem is that, in real politics, the megaphone hersquos been pointing at people who think like him will be turned on an entirely dferent audience: voters who need to be convinced therersquos a coherent, rational and calm plan for Scottish independence.Those kind of voters are unlikely to be impressed by Mr Campbellrsquos aggressive style.

Of those, they ruled out  who suffered from sleep cycle problems and identied  in the remaining , who had advanced sleep phase.However four of those declined further tests, leaving the team with . per cent of the total patients with the condition. But they believe the figure should be higher because many sufferers would not bother to go to a sleep clinic.Mr Ptacek said: ldquoGenerally, we find it is the people with delayed sleep phase ndash those night owls that canrsquot sleep until as late as am ndash who are more likely to visit a sleep clinic. They have trouble getting up for work and frequently deal with chronic sleep deprivation. Participants in the study had their sleep logged and melatonin, oxygen, brainwave, heart rate and breathing levels tested.

Finlay gave an address to the Smile For Future meeting, which was attended by about  people from  countries, including Swedish climate activist Ms Thunberg.The three main demands include ldquoclimate justice, increased awareness of the results of scientic research on climate change as well as keeping global warming limited to .C compared with pre-industrial levels.But Finlayrsquos fame went ahead of him. ldquoGreta said lsquoyoursquore Finlay from Ullapoolrsquo, said the boyrsquos father, Geoff. ldquoThey spoke about the environment and Finlay thanked her for inspiring all the young climate activists around the world.Ms Thunberg recently became the first person to receive a GQ Men Of The Year award, which was specically created to celebrate her work on the global climate crisis.The -year-old is on the cover of the latest issue of GQ ahead of formally being crowned the magazinersquos Game Changer Of The Year next month.Ms Thunberg spearheaded school strikes for climate change, encouraging students across the world to skip classes and call for action from world leaders. GQ magazine editor Dylan Jones hailed her ldquofearless dedication to raising awareness of the global climate change crisis.The teenager, who will receive the award via a video link, said: ldquoI am very grateful and this award is for everyone in the Fridays For Future movement, everyone whose school is striking for the climate.ldquoWe all deserve this award because together we have accomplished so much. So thank you to everyone who has been school striking as well.Ms Thunberg, who is taking a year off school to raise awareness of climate change, is set to attend the UN climate summit in New York next month, travelling by racing yacht and avoiding planes, as well as polluting cruise ships.But Finlay is fast developing his own fan following. Television wildle presenter Chris Packham described him as ldquoinspirational after an online row with Grylls saw him trolled online. The BBC Springwatch host hailed Finlay a hero for standing up to the intimidation, and even invited the youngster to share a stage with him.ldquoI donrsquot think it is right to put sharks in tanks and make money from it, Finlay told the BBC at the time. ldquoAs chief scout I thought it set a very bad example to children on how we should treat animals.The -year-old has spent part of his year on a mini-world tour. In June he travelled to Vancouver, Canada, on an international organisation-sponsored scholarship to attend the Ocean Heroes Bootcamp. The three-day event trains young people to be global ambassadors for fighting plastic pollution.On histo the UK, Finlay went to Sheffield for the Childrenrsquos Media Conference  after being selected as one of  ldquochange makers.His presentation was on sharks, plastics and climate change and how the media can help educate and spread positive message to young people.Earlier this month Finlay was also on a youth  at Birdfair, Rutland Water, near Leicester, with other young wildle campaigners answering questions from the audience on subject of wildlersquos future and the impact of climate change.His mother Rachel said: ldquoWe are very proud of Finlay ndash he is so passionate about trying to persuade people to make a dference to the planet.ldquoHe also learns a lot talking about subjects like plastic pollution in the sea and sharks.ldquoHe made a New Yearrsquos resolution to become vegetarian for the sake of the planet ndash which he has kept to ndash and is now thinking of going vegan. He has also persuaded us to switch to a hybrid car. He really is an inspiration to us and others.In March Finlay took his antipollution message to the heart of the European Parliament. He travelled more than , miles by train on ajourney with his father to lobby over climate change.The youngsters was one of only three children from the UK to join pupils from countries including Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Latvia, Lithuania and the Netherlands.ldquoMost of all I want the people who make decisions over our lives to see this world is dying, Finlay said. ldquoI want them to reduce manrsquos carbon footprint as well as cut back on farming and plastic use. I hope I and other young people can influence the people we trust to look after us.The charity Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, based in America, has since made Finlay their shark ambassador. ldquoWhen Irsquom in the water snorkelling I feel at peace and I want to protect the marine environment ndash and that is what I was trying to do, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"win-no-voter-economy-stupid","story":"It may be that living here, now, in our identity-dominated politics, repels me. It may be the low quality of our petty, patronising political discourse at Scottish, UK and EU level. Or it may be the cringe I feel when I hear that the NHS or the education system or whatever  is the ldquoenvy of the world, with all available evidence suggesting the contrary.Either way, Irsquom not exercised by national identity. My political decisions are made clinically. I am emotionally cold to political parties and to the sides of a referendum campaign. I cast my vote based purely on the perceived risk and reward for me and my family.All of this is to make clear that, whilst I may not win a Patriot of the Year award, I am not uncomfortable with the theory of living in an independent Scotland. But in rsquos independence referendum my risk reward matrix led me to vote No. In truth, it was not a dficult choice. I have never doubted the long-term viability of an independent Scotland, but in the short-term I saw a fiscal hole with a policy  which would have made it bigger, not smaller. Too much risk, not enough reward.My choice was not an unusual one it is generally accepted through subsequent polling that uncertainty over the economic case was the central inhibitor to pushing the Yes campaign over the  per cent line.The prospect of a second independence referendum is now real. The  Scottish election is the most important in devolutionrsquos short history. The campaign will be, as good as, single-issue: should there or should there not be another referendum  If the pro-independence partiesa Holyrood majority, based on a clear, unambiguous and identical manesto pledge, then indyref  is in my view a democratic requirement. This is, effectively, the point acknowledged by both John McDonnell and David Mundell last week.How could Yes win  First, it could double-down on the - ldquocampaign ndash tack to the left, promote populist economics, arrange a big march, wave some Palestinian flags, Bairns Not Bombs, End London Rule and all the rest.Perhaps we are in an era where this can work. The recent record of prevailing economic theory winning political arguments is murky. The Yes campaign in  almost won despite the economic orthodoxy running contrary, as did Jeremy Corbyn in , and in , of course, the Leave campaign proved that relentless economic warnings can be ignored by a majority of the population.However this ndash a win based on a socialist fairytale ndash is no way to create a new country. We can damn private enterprise, wealth creators and taxpayers, but without them wersquoll find ourselves at the bottom of a social and economic pit in short order. This is student union politics, and high school economics. Eventhey could win this way, they shouldnrsquot.I spend most days with the Scottish business community. Their world is ruled by risk. And although, of course, this ies industry-to-industry, they generally see three primary political risks affecting their business. The first, and most concerning for them, is a Corbyn-led Labour government, the second is Scottish independence and the third is Brexit. Yes campaigners may wish that this order was radically altered, but that is the reality on the ground.Most people in business ndash generally Remainers, generally No voters ndash are miles away from voting Yes, and every time they see the marchers and their flags and their populism on a Saturday afternoon, they move still further. They want to see some adults in the room.It is not as though the SNP doesnrsquot understand this. Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission was an effort to reassure this key demographic. And it was a very good one, primarily, in my view, because it acknowledged the economic reality of a small country in a big world, and did not bow to populism .But the Wilson report is one of very few items on that side of the balancing scale, still sitting high in the air, weighed down by the cacophony of evidence that the economic argument has not evolved.The SNP needs a long runway to prove that an independent Scotland can be an economic success story. There are a couple of obvious hurdles along the way. The first will come later this year, with the Scottish Governmentrsquos annual Budget. Since the  election ed a minority government, the SNP has relied on Green support for three budgets in a row. Each one has involved further concessions each one has pulled the SNP further left, particularly on tax. Not a lot just a little each time. The  budget will do the same.With the backdrop of a Boris Johnson government which might lower personal taxes in England, an expanding gap between Scottish and English taxpayers will really start to bite. Scots donrsquot like paying taxes any more than anyone  attempts to argue the contrary are delusional.The second hurdle is,anything, more dficult to tackle. Over the coming weeks, Westminster mathematics may present the SNP with an opportunity to replace Boris Johnson with Jeremy Corbyn infor a second independence referendum. This will be tempting. Indeed, it will likely be impossible to resist, and I am not suggesting that it should be.However, this action would have a consequence. As the leaders of the past, current and future Yes campaign, the SNP is responsible for creating that sensible economic narrative. Where does putting Mr Corbyn into Downing Street fit into it The Yes campaign needs to build economic competence. From scratch. Partly because it will help it win. But primarily becausewersquore going to be an independent country, then we need to be a grown-up country. We all need to live here, after all."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-gettinh-pampered","story":"READER Gerry Minnery was discombobulated to come across a nappy-vending machine in a motorway gentsrsquo toilet.

The mystery picture of Otello Mammi with Sandy Thomson and dogPhilip siad, “Ms Mammi knows that after being captured and becoming a prisoner-or-war, initially at “Camp No ” near Sheffield, her father was employed on a farm, and that he had a local friend, named as Sandy Thomson. “The photograph shows these two men, and on the back of the photograph is the inscription of which reads “The Cottage, Badenscoth, Rothienorman.

The word at the bottom seems to be “Cluck” - I do not know the signicance of this.“It seems from this inscription that Otello Mammi was working in the Rothienorman area, perhaps at a farm owned by Sandy Thomson, or where Mr Thomson was also employed. Badenscoth is the name of a small locality about two miles to the North-west of Rothienorman.Philip added, “During my research I have found a reference to the Aberdeen Journal of March , which gives a numbered list of “additional War Work Parties”.One of the work parties was in the charge of “Miss Hislop, The Cottage, Badenscoth, Rothienorman”. Of course, this was too early in the war for The Cottage to have any connection with prisoners-of-war, but it would appear that the The Cottage had some connection with work for the war effort. It was evidently the home of “Miss Hislop” and the two men were later photographed there.“As you will see, the photograph is in poor condition with creases, surface damage etc. but its main features can be seen.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. The overall number of geese will be maintained at a healthy, sustainable population.

But now that Lord Ashcroft’s poll has confirmed that the feeling ismutual, there’s been a tidal wave of influential opinion pieces from the English left, urging Scots to launch the leboats and save ourselves. According to Matthew Norman in the Independent: “Were I Scottish, I would be mad for independence. I’d say sod the crude oil price [and] sod the Barnett formula.” Last week John McDonnell’s surprise revelation that Labour will not block a second independent referendum prompted the ’s John Harris to promise: “If another independence vote materialised … I would be back there [Scotland] in a flash, to seeat least one part of these islands can leave behind the current wretchedness, and find something better.” Yesterday the Observer carried a long piece from Aberdeenshire, where  per cent voted No in . Harriet Sherwood observed: “In Inverurie’s market square, most willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the Union.” That’s perfectly true, but Sherwood’s piece is full of quotes from No voters ready to publicly admit they’ve changed their minds or at least are open to argument. Simon Jenkins’ no-holds-barred Comment is Free column last week was the most widely circulated on social media. Clearly no heartfelt supporter of independence, Jenkins surveyed the long history of English indference to first Irish and then Scottish Home Rule campaigns, compared Scotland’s flatlining GDP with that of soaring Denmark and suggested “separatists” should thank Boris and Brexit for hammering the final nails into the Union’s coffin: “If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster Parliament.”Scots-born Times’ columnist Iain Martin insists the end of the Union isn’t preordained but admits the “most ominous news for unionists” was that only  per cent of Ashcroft’s poll sample thought Scotland would vote to stay in the UK in a second independence poll. Actually the truly ominous news was probably already known. The UK Government’s private polling has remained unpublished in Scotland for obvious reasons – but Boris Johnson would be well aware of its contents. So, everything from the “do or die” Brexit declaration to the ridiculous  pence coin “celebration” has occurred in the full knowledge they are driving Scots towards independence. Clearly the Minister for the Union believes that’s a price worth paying. Martin’s solution has already been outlined by others without the capacity to enact it: “A commission devolving maximum powers across Britain, on taxation, for example, and something closer to a federal collection of states, pooling defence and foreign affairs [with] an elected replacement for the Lords in the shape of a Britain-wide senate.” Friend, it ain’t gonna happen and everyone knows it. Gordon Brown’s weekend intervention ironically confirms that the F-option is stone dead. Five years after his fateful Vow, the former Labour leader insists that, “to prevent the rise and rise of dysal nationalism, the first step is to stop no-deal in its tracks”. Really.Quite apart from the Ashcroft poll’s revelation that  per cent of Scottish Labour voters also back “dysal nationalism” , SNP politicians have been highly visible in the legal action that won the right for MPs to revoke Article  and will be part of this week’s court bid to stop Johnson suspending parliament. Despite taking pelters for their troubles, Nicola Sturgeon and her MPs are trying to stop no-deal in its tracks far more constructively than the party Brown once led. In fact, his stale rhetoric only serves to remind voters that “a system of government as close to federalism as you can have” never materialised. Instead the Brexit power grab and new Westminster plans to spend cash directly in Scotland mean the Vow is meaningless and its architect is lost in time. Still, the intervention of the English Left and prominent Remainers is strange, given that Scotland’s departure would leave them with a near-permanent Tory majority – or whatever worse fate awaits once Brexit delivers economic disaster. Are they motivated by a selfless “you go, because we can’t” sentiment or by enlightened self-interest – “you create a sane, social democracy because we may need escape north soon” A friend went south last month to visit English relatives who were quite hostile to independence first time around. Now they want to knowtheir kids will get passports in the new independent statethey attend Scottish universities now. It certainly seems that many English people are surprisingly clear-sighted and decisive about independence – either from a “glad to see the back of the whining Jocks” perspective or from an honest acknowledgment that Scots “didn’t vote for this mess”. My guess is that important strands of English opinion have never been sentimental about the Union. It’s just been an arrangement that has now run its course – in the view of prominent players on both sides. South of the Border, the Union has been a calculation, not a calling – however overwrought English politicians sometimes contrive to appear.Former Labour MP Tom Harris told Radio Scotland last weekend that the “hard Left” of his party “always regarded the Union as a colonial construct. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn stayed at home on his allotment when Labour MPs came up in .”Perhaps. In Scotland, though, that colonial construct has been much more than a calculation. It’s been cloaked with sentiment, studded with power and fuelled by the chronic fear of failure that bedevils the disempowered. Thanks to Johnson and Brexit, that cloak is slipping to reveal the intractable problems that blight the once gilded Union path. Opinion here is taking a while to turn, but that’s understandable.Folk are detaching from the authority of Westminster and considering the idea of a new independent country without a blueprint to hand. But make no mistake. Quiet consideration is a crucial part of any change process. A final decision needs a final focus – a deadline. And several are fast approaching. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh council leader and partner to become dads for the first time","story":"THE Capital#s youngest ever council leader is set to become the first authority boss to take adoption leave when he and his partner #become dads for the first time#.Cllr Adam McVey will welcome two boys with his partner later this month and will take a six-week break from his busy council duties to look after the new arrivals.The -year-old SNP councillor for Leith is thought to be the first council leader to take adoption leave.He said: “I’m very excited that my family is expanding later this month as we become dads for the first time to two amazing boys.“I’ll soon be taking adoption leave to start the hardest and most rewarding job I’ll ever have.”No decision has been taken yet as to who will temporarily take over from Cllr McVey – but proposals will be tabled at the next meeting of the full council on Thursday  August and could involve an SNP councillor being given additional duties.Cllr McVey added: “I’m acutely aware of my duty to the people of Edinburgh and I look forward to ing to City Chambers to continue delivering the change our future generations demand of us.“In the meantime, I’ll be asking the council to approve cover arrangements while I’m on six weeks of adoption leave to cover my responsibilities.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

MagowanThe work undertaken by Portadown based AG Wilson Civil Engineering will see the area transformed to showcase the beautul surroundings of Gilford.And the company this week gave a sneak peak of the work carried out with a stunning video.Spearheaded by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, phase two of the Gilford Riverside Trail was funded with cash from the SOARVillage Renewal Measure.Walkers and cyclists across the Borough will soon have the chance to meander down a picturesque pathway alongside the beautul Bann River in Gilford, thanks to funding of £, from SOAR .Phase  was completed in  at Stramore Park and Phase  will connect these lands to Woodlands Park by the creation of an m riverside walking and cycling trail.The project has involved the creation of a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and the construction of a new footbridge across the millrace linking the trail to Woodlands Park.The route passes over part of the old mill race and land between the river and the in-filled mill pond.Sharing their video on social media AG Wilson said: “As the Gilford Riverside Trail project nears completion, we are excited to share a sneak preview of the works undertaken by AGW on behalf of ABC Council.”Keep up to date with the latest AG Wilson projects via their Facebook page on facebook,com agwilsoncivils‘Should be made known to the

fascinating book of religious art that dates to the early s.-year-old Fred Brady bought the dusty tome from a market in Kildare over -years ago, and it had lain forgotten in his attic for decades.Published in  by the now seemingly defunct Catholic Picture Company of Ireland, the book includes high-quality prints of the Stations of the Cross, which depict the crucixion of Jesus Christ.While largely an artistic work, the book offers some detail of its publication. The book states that “being the nineteenth century of the Redemption of mankind” the then Pope, Pius XI, had proclaimed  a “Holy Year”.“These facts have prompted the publishers to devise and reproduce this beautul and artistic Album containing the fourteen ‘Stations of the Cross’,” it states.“The primary purpose of the work of Irish Art is to provide a most appropriate and lasting souvenir for the Catholic home, in honour and commemoration of Holy Year.”It also reveals that the artworks are “exact replicas of the celebrated and valuable set in the Church of Mount Alphonsus, Limerick”, which belonged to the Redemptorist Fathers, who gave permission for their reproduction.According to the Redemptorists in Limerick, the Stations of the Cross in their church date back to  – just four years after the church was officially completed.Explaining his find, Fred said: “I bought it in a massive market in Kildare. I’m  now, so I would say it was about  years ago, maybe more.“I liked it because it was the Stations of the Cross and I thought it maybe would be worth a few bob in a lot of years’ time, but I never tried to sell it or do anything with it. It was exactly like that when I bought it so it was a good few years old then.“I just found it up in the attic of the house. I was clearing the attic out because we’re changing over from oil to gas and I came across it again.”He continued: “I just want to see what’s what with it.

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying. The angst of the Troubles, that pent up anger everything was exorcised on a weekly basis through Baraka’s performances.“This month is going to be a memorable one, I’m looking forward to seeing Brianon the night at the Devenish who’d be a good friend of mine.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support.

Royal Navy veteran Darren has worked as a project manager at Harland  Wolff for the past five years. \"Darren is being quite philosophical about it, as they all knew that administration was imminent,\" Marie said. \"But the shipyard has always been part of our family background and heritage - Darrens grandfather and some of our uncles worked there. \"If youre from east Belfast the shipyard is in your DNA and no matter where you went you always saw those iconic cranes. \"Its very eerie being down there at the moment with the complete and utter silence, but the atmosphere among the workers is quite optimistic. \"Their spirits are still high as they feel they have some sort of control over their lives at the minute,\" she added. Marie says the tickets, sponsored by Martin Lynch and GBL Productions, have been offered to the shipyard workers for tonights performance of The Miami Showband Story at the Grand Opera House in a show of solidarity. \"A lot of the guys who worked in the shipyard lived through the showband era and they know the music associated with it, so we just wanted to offer them a bit of escapism and hopefully lt their spirits,\" she said. Co-writer Martin Lynch added: \"This is only a small gesture to some of those who have lost their jobs, but we wanted them to know that people care about them and they havent been forgotten about. \"If the workers can come along to enjoy a show where everyone leaves so full of joy, then we hope that would be a good night out for them in the middle of this despair.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"vigil held in new lodge to support residents after days of unrest","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, a charity called Think Pacic provided the young woman with the vehicle to fulfil her ambition.“I’ve always wanted to go away to help people, because my degree involves quite a degree of caring for people. One of my friends at university did it last year, so I spoke to him about it and then we had a talk about at university and I looked at the Think Pacic website as well. Then I had a phone interview and got accepted for it.“After I was accepted into the programme, I just read up on it and became more interested in doing something,” Orlaith said.Think Pacic allows volunteers to sample le at the heart of remote Fijian villages far removed from what normally passes as backpacking trips in students gap years. Each team of volunteers stays in a dferent community and they are immersed into every aspect of the le of the country’s customs, values and traditions.“We had a welcome ceremony when we entered the village and were given a traditional Fijian drink called Kava. It’s a sedative drink derived from the pepper plant and it’s used for ceremonial occasions.“The Fijian’s believe in sharing everything so no one ever goes without. They are a very traditional people and we had to dress very modestly so as not to show any disrespect. Our shoulders had to be covered and we had to wear long dresses called Bula dresses and skirts called Sulu’s,” Orlaith continued.The charity was founded in the early s and adopts a bespoke approach to its volunteer work in the South Pacic country. Often, teams of volunteers are the first top have ever worked in the communities they visit because the trips only take placea Fijian community agrees to invite them there in the first place. Rather than focussing on just a single school or location it means that Think Pacic can reach thousands of children each year and spread the message of education, sport and health.This model means that the overall project is sustainable, especially as volunteers train local leaders to carry on the work after they have departed. It’s also a programme that has been fully embraced by the Fijian Government.Orlaith, a former student at Lumen Christi says that Think Pacic have taken specic steps to avoid what’s become known as ‘voluntourism’. The term refers to the growing phenomenon of iniduals travelling to developing countries to carry out volunteer work. Recently, there have been increasing concerns about voluntourism and in particular gap year projects that some have suggested that can cause more harm than good to host communities.Primary concerns are that some charitable organisations are running volunteering trips along business lines and can result in the institutionalisation of children.Orlaith Duffy’s month long stay in Fiji was on the country’s main island Viti Levu at Muanaira village- a remote rural setting around two hours from the national capital Suva.Orlaith told the Derry News: “Think Pacic have moved away from voluntourism because they know that a lot of organisations take students money and students are staying in hotels and then spending a small amount of time helping people.“So, it’s a bit contradictory. Think Pacic want you to live with villagers then every day from am until pm we would go to the school. We would teach from am until pm they do sports in the afternoon.”In fact, teaching in the in the village school where the pupil’s age range runs from six to -years of age is a vital component of the volunteering workOrlaith continued: “Think Pacic have dferent key learning aims. Schooling in Fiji is very basic, so I noticed that children at the same age over they compared to our own children here had very dferent levels of education.“Their education is so far behind because teachers just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on the children that are falling behind. We would have sat in the classroom and noticedthere were particular children falling behind. Then we would take them out and do one on one’s with them. We tried to strip it back to basics and do basic maths with them before moving on to the more dficult stuff that they were getting taught in class.“We also did a lot of letter phonics with their sounds and their grammar because sometimes they didn’t understand why certain words were put in front of other words and sentences. And we did a lot of work with past and present tenses because they weren’t sure about that either. We got to choose what age group we wanted to work with as well so the one on one sessions would have been with primary one’s up until primary sevens. So, I chose ‘kindi’, like nursey, which was five-year-olds. They were learning their alphabet and numbers and arts and crafts. We did a dferent letter with them each day. They would practice how to draw the letter and practice their numbers.”In the classroom the children are expected to converse in English-something which presents another educational challenge.Three main languages are used in Fiji-English, Fijian and Fijian Hindi. Fijian is spoken by most indigenous Fijians who account for almost  per cent of the country’s population. Fijian’s of Indian descent make up another  per cent of the population and mainly speak Fijian Hindi.The English language is a remnant of British colonial rule and was the sole official language until . English is widely used in government, business and education circles, but business is also widely carried out in Fijian, especially in rural areas.A small number of other Indigenous West Fijian and East Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Chinese and Rotuman are also spoken by immigrant populations.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshOrlaith said: “In school it’s all English. The younger children find it more dficult and the teacher would speak Fijian to the nursery children-so half in English, half in Fijian. But everything  is done in English.”Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji and is home to  per cent of the entire population-around , people. The island is just over  miles long and  miles wide. Its rugged terrain is explained by the fact that it was created largely as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Territorially, the island is ided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range running from north to south. The island’s centre is covered by forest and is dominated by Fiji’s highest mountain-Mount Tomanivi which stands at , feet.The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, while the western side, also called the \"burning west\" is noticeably drier in the ranges rain shadow. Similarly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being built in the east. Fijis biggest cattle ranch is at Yaqara, with  head of cattle on its , acres.Orlaith Duffy said: “Living with the villagers gave us a better idea of the culture. Living standards are very basic-a lot of mornings there would be no running water to wash or brush teeth. The water pressure was a lot better at night. The houses only had a single tap so the man of the house would spend time filling a lot of buckets with water so that would be used for cooking. The shower we had was a bucket with holes in it, so we just used that to wash ourselves.“In Fiji as well, the diet is very carb heavy and very sugar heavy. There’s a need to encourage children to brush their teeth so we took toothpaste and toothbrushes out there. The school I went to was already quite well developed in that way so that was good to see.“There was a man in our village and because he had severe diabetes he had to have his leg amputated. So, we carried out a health workshop and spoke about strokes and heart attacks and how to spot the signs, prevent them and what to doyou see someone taken one. We also did basic teaching on how to clean cuts and not to leave them exposed. We left first aid kits behind in the village as well.Like the domestic dwellings Orlaith said that the school buildings were also basic consisting of concrete and corrugated roofs.“If there isn’t enough room to accommodate all of the children they would add on a couple of Portacabins.“Some of the villages are remote, so people make their living from fishing. But where I stayed, because it was around two hours from the capital, I noticed that a lot of the Fijian’s who are my age where at university. When we lived with a family, we referred to the parents as our mum and dad.“My Fijian dad was in the military, so it was interesting to talk to him because he was very well travelled. The mum has a degree in accounting, but she has given it up because she’s looking after the children. But, a lot of the islanders don’t work at all because they were the ones that fell behind at school.“Luckily, our school was only a  minute walk from the village but I know that other school’s are about  minutes or an hour’s trek every day. I also noticed that sometimes the children just aren’t encouraged to go to school by their parents because some of them would have just stayed in the village during the day. I think us being there did make attendance better and the teacher noticed that the behaviour was a lot better too,” said Orlaith.The Derry News put it to Orlaith that she could have easily spent her summer backpacking in the region as opposed to volunteering-so why did she become involved “I just thought whenever I was reading on it that it made feel how lucky I was to come from here and because Cardf University gave us the chance to go and do something-I just really wanted to help then.“Some of my friends went to Africa this summer to test eyes, but I couldn’t do that because they are a year ahead of me in their studies. When I looked into Think Pacic I thought that it would be a good idea and I can always go back thereI want to because now that I’ve volunteered there will be an opportunity to go back as a leader next year.“So, I could lead a group of people that were in my position this year. Then you can go on to be a project manager and oversee a few dferent teams.“When I got there at the start I thought ‘what am I doing here on the other side of the world ’ There was no Wi-Fi, barely any signal to call home. I actually bought a ‘brick’ phone so I could call home, but it was very limited, I had to stand in certain parts of the area to get a signal.“But, once I settled in that you saw how rewarding this was because the children improved each day and the people are so friendly. They have nothing, but they never complain or never in a bad mood. The people are very community based soI was walking through the village at night dferent families would be calling me in to eat dinner with them.“It was very rare for my and my family to be eating dinner alone because there was always loads of other people in our house eating with us because they invite everyone in. Even when we were getting a bus to the village,you shout ‘bula’ that means hello, but it also means ‘be given le’.“Everyone says hello to everyone . I thought it was quite similar to home because we say hello when we walk past someone in the street, but at university in Cardf people don’t do that. They put their heads down and walk on. I found that the Fijians are quite similar to Irish people because home and family are close to them, but they take it to the next level by inviting everyone it and checking how people are.”Anyone wishing to volunteer for Think Pacic must be between the ages of -.

We sought to engage the involvement of the Organisers and their Marshals to assist us in that and they were unable to do so. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“With a large number of people delayed for a signicant amount of time, where some people were parading on the Cityside and other people were waiting on the Waterside area of the City, instead of persisting in that delay with the risks that entailed, we chose to make other operational arrangements to help ensure that people were kept safe and prevent a breach of the peace or a likely breach of the peace for the remainder of the parade.“Once the parade was finished we took steps to seek to identy those within the band so that we could fulfil our duty to put the matters and facts before the Public Prosecution Service in order that they might determinethere was any liability on the part of those people responsible. That is a legitimate policing purpose and was done so professionally. Once those details and assurances were given to us those people were free to travel on their way. “As a policing service we have a professional responsibility, and a legitimate purpose, to maintain the peace and keep people safe. These were the objectives of our decision making on Saturday. The event passed off peacefully, people were kept safe, no one was hurt and nobody was unduly inconvenienced by police actions. “Derry Londonderry has for a long time been considered the model for parades and protest. Efforts must now turn to dialogue to ensure that the that the good work of years gone by can be continued.”"},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist raises","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Welshpool hand-cyclist raises over K for charityAndrew Paddison in training for his Land’s End to John O’Groats hand bike chltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtarity ride.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events. How would it go down with our visitors  Wersquod never done anything like this before.As it turned out, stomach butterflies were swtly replaced with full bellies.ldquoIt sold out very quickly and in the end there were lots of smiling faces and empty plates, Mr Gardiner said. ldquoThe only downside was that the volunteers didnrsquot have any leftovers to enjoy.Mr Gardiner reveals the preparation that went into the event.ldquoWe knew the food would be great. It was freshly prepared by Franck Breacuteteacutecheacute from Mange Tout, who we have worked with before on private charters mdash including my own th birthday party mdash and we were determined that this would look the part.ldquoWe scoured charity shops across the county to give forgotten but beautul old bone china tea sets a new lease of le, including fabricating  new cake stands from scratch using these lovely vintage finds ndash no modern off the shelf crockery for us.ldquoIt also marked an attempt to ersy our offering and attract more people to the railway and the local area than might otherwise come.Paula OrsquoNeill, along with her friends Natasha Mellon and Denise McGuinness, travelled from Ardee in Co Louth and gave the day the thumbs up.ldquoThe gluten free option was excellent mdash great iety and lovely presentation with plenty of options of drinks available.

The group was also taken on a walking tour of Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch.The Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group also organised a charity garden party to enable the visitors to meet their friends from the Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas in an informal setting, which included the councilrsquos deputy chairman, Terry Andrews, and concluded with a rousing performance of La Marseillaise.Cllr Casey welcomed the French delegation with a reception at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch.He said: ldquoThe main objectives of the three-year plan of the twinning arrangement are to organise healthy activities and events, bring generations together in experiencing two fabulous cultures and share our heritage with partners from all over the south of Ireland, west of Scotland, Galacia in Spain, Wales, the Isle of Man and Brittany.ldquoAs part of our councilrsquos strategic objectives, we are striving to become a premier tourism destination on the island of Ireland, and empowering and improving the capacity of our communities.He told the visitors: ldquoThese objectives could not have been achieved without the continued support we have received from initiatives such as twinning arrangements.ldquoFrom visiting the area and investing in our local businesses, to bringing dferent cultural experiences to the citizens of our district through ious projects, I would like to thank you.He added: ldquoOur mission as a council is to lead and serve a district that is prosperous, healthy and sustainable.ldquoI am pleased to have you all here to celebrate the  years of this twinning arrangement.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down. They had a proud tradition and the opening of the new park was the fulfilment of a dream.The new park was blessed by Fr Charles Bready, PP, Loughinisland, Among those also presentwere Gerard McShane, East Down chairman T P Murphy, county secretary Harry McEvoy, Ulster Council delegate and Matt Fitzpatrick, county registrar.LISTOODER mdash Mr Thomas Steenson, who is leaving shortly to live in America, was the recipient of a specially inscribed Bible from Mr James Brownlee, Worshipful Master of Listooder Orange Lodge, at a dance in Listooder on Friday night..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gaelic championship fever erupts  ","story":"CHAMPIONSHIP fever will be sweeping through the county over the next five days.Reputations will be put on the line as all the sparring that has taken place throughout the league campaigns is replaced by an iron resolve to make a mark.The action gets underway tomorrow night with four games down for decision.Most interest will be focused on Pairc Esler with Clonduff taking on Saval in the SFC at pm. A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
