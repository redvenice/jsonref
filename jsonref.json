Rusty said Angel saw the post and said: \u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027           In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Rusty Updegraff claims the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would leave town for ten days at a time and not call her children. He says seeing the emotional impact her behavior was having on Angel and even Phoenix, 19, spurred him to actJudge Mark Juhas imposed the strict regulations while he works out what to do over long term custody with her ex Belafonte.The order says Mel can, \u0027hire an acceptable nanny from a registered and bonded agency\u0027 to satisfy the requirement, but there must be someone \u0027present\u0027 so that the star is not left alone with her child unsupervised.Restaurateur Rusty says he is pleased with the outcome and it was never his intention to push for Mel to lose custody of her children.\u0027I did the job, you know, because it\u0027s about the kids, not about her,\u0027 he said.\u0027Those girls love their mom and Melanie loves the girls, but Melanie desperately needs help.\u0027I want her to be clean and healthy, because when she\u0027s healthy she can be a mom again. Right now she\u0027s the world\u0027s worst mom.\u0027Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot.And during the shouting matches the America\u0027s Got Talent judge would often hit out at sports mad Angel calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant.He recalls: \u0027Angel\u0027s a tomboy, she doesn\u0027t like to shower, she\u0027s at that age, so Mel nicknames her smelly b***h, she\u0027s like, \u0027you want to be a smelly b***h? Everybody will call you smelly b***h\u0027 and she\u0027d just keep going.\u0027I pleaded with her, \u0027\u0027please don\u0027t say that to your daughter\u0027\u0027. She responded: \u0027\u0027Why? She is a smelly b***h… she stinks.\u0027\u0027\u0027Angel is 11 years old, that\u0027s going to stay with her, I know because my dad was like that...it just creates these insecurities in children as they get older.\u0027          Rusty claims that the singer cruelly bullied her 11-year-old daughter Angel (pictured together), calling her a \u0027stinky b**ch\u0027 for refusing to wear deodorant          Updegraff filed the bombshell deposition in regards to the America\u0027s Got Talent judge after witnessing her behavior while he was looking after her young children for nine months          Recalling the worst incidents at Mel\u0027s Hollywood home he said the pop singer would down tequila and spark blazing rows with daughter Angel, with Madison in earshot. Pictured: Mel B with Angel (left), Madison (center) and Phoenix, 19, (right) on Mother\u0027s Day           Updegraff shared texts messages he received from Mel B\u0027s best friend Charlotte, who tried to stage an intervention with the singer, which lists her numerous partners          The screenshots Updegraff provided also reveal an enormous tower of tequila boxes stockpiled in Mel B\u0027s homeOn another occasion one of the star\u0027s Instagram posts got the attention of Angel.Mel posed naked with hairdresser and BFF Gary Madatyan, who was also naked, in a swimming pool and posted the provocative photos on her social media feed.Rusty, 60, recalls the shocking moment Mel\u0027s daughter spotted the post.\u0027We were in Palm Springs and Mel had been drinking. I was on my last nerve and Mel had been on a roll in LA before she even went to Palm Springs.\u0027Then Angel saw an Instagram post of Melanie naked with Gary her hairdresser and she\u0027s like, \u0027\u0027Oh my God, Mommy\u0027s naked, what is she doing?\u0027\u0027\u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad.\u0027Angel was embarrassed that Mommy had done this. Mel\u0027s kids are seeing her Instagram, Angel is 11 but her mind isn\u0027t developed, it\u0027s truly sad.\u0027And in more concerning behavior Rusty says Mel would regularly go away from home on work trips for seven or ten days at a time but she never once called her children to check they were okay.\u0027I mean, who does that,\u0027 said Rusty.Rusty says he was spending so much time with the two girls that he quickly became \u0027attached\u0027 and found caring for them \u0027so rewarding\u0027.\u0027They\u0027re so funny and so interesting, they ask a million questions, they\u0027re great,\u0027 he said. \u0027Madison is, I swear to God, she\u0027s a TV personality and she doesn\u0027t understand why she\u0027s funny.Warring Mel B and Stephen Belafonte slash $1.5m off the...EXCLUSIVE: Mel B is ordered to submit random drug and...Mel B accused by her male nanny of cocaine binges, drinking...Share this article    He continued: \u0027And I\u0027m like, Oh God, how do I explain this one, then she comments that Mommy has the worst grammar, which was cute, but it\u0027s sad\u0027           Updegraff said he thought Madison (pictured with Mel at a filming of America\u0027s Got Talent) was about to be molested by one of her male friends, as the man allegedly tried to take the little girl into the shower to \u0027clean\u0027 her \u0027And Angel, brilliant. She\u0027s kind of to herself, but a brilliant writer, artist and creative person. She loves sports and loves to sing.\u0027One night her grandma was there, Melanie was at work and she came down, she was doing her homework and we started talking to her about it and she had written a story which was great.\u0027And she was so excited that we were reading her story that she ran upstairs and brought down a box full of stories that she\u0027s written.\u0027And this is why I think it\u0027s sad. Melanie had no clue about this until I told her. Like, how do you not know?\u0027Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior.\u0027They want to know why there\u0027s a naked man in Mommy\u0027s room or who was that guy in the kitchen with his shirt off,\u0027 he said.\u0027I tried to answer their questions as best I could.\u0027Rusty says Mel\u0027s sex life got out of control and he worried about the children being exposed to different strange men.\u0027There was like three guys in a day and I\u0027m talking five hour sessions with each one because the guy goes, you know, I talked to the guys and they\u0027re like, I can\u0027t go anymore.\u0027And then another guy would come in and another guy. There was the waiter from Soho House, the guy she ran into at the car wash, there was the piano teacher, a guy nicknamed Frenchie, another French guy, then there was the artist guy, and you have to remember they were on rotation too.\u0027There were men coming over to her house at all hours, who are virtual strangers, and they are around the children. I am worried she doesn\u0027t know these guys.\u0027          Rusty says he acted as a \u0027buffer\u0027 between Mel and her girls so they didn\u0027t witness some her of worst behavior          Mel and Stephen orced in December last year, but have continued to fight over custody of their two youngest children, Angel Murphy Brown (pictured left) 11, (Mel\u0027s daughter by Eddie Murphy) and Madison Belafonte          The doting dad, 43, and his youngest daughter bonding - just a few days after Belafonte was granted temporary custodyHaving been molested as a child Rusty says he knows all too well how something shocking can happen quickly.\u0027It makes me so angry hand on heart I honestly thought that Madison was potentially going to be molested by one of her man friends,\u0027 he said.\u0027He wanted to clean her in the shower after they went swimming when Mel left the house.\u0027What man thinks it is okay to take a six-year-old girl, not his child, into a shower, and I thought that is wrong.\u0027Had I not been there that day, I dread to think what would have happened.\u0027Things got so bad that Rusty claims Mel\u0027s mother Andrea, sister Danielle and best friend Charlotte flew in to LA in April to carry out an intervention due to her excessive drinking.Unfortunately the action didn\u0027t go down too well with Brown.\u0027When they came over Mel spent one whole day ignoring them, upstairs having sex with an actor at the house, with the stereo blazing. That pushed things to the edge,\u0027 he recalls. \u0027They all had blazing rows.\u0027He continued: \u0027Mel would drink so much at the house and pass out, so if there was an emergency I dread to think what would happen with the kids.\u0027I am really concerned about those kids, who I grew very close to during my nine months.\u0027When I was there they were protected, but the kids cannot look after themselves - and Mel is not focused on them. At times I felt her vagina mattered more than the children.\u0027She left them often, without proper supervision, so something serious could\u0027ve happened.\u0027Those kids are in jeopardy and I had to act before something disastrous happened.\u0027          Rusty says he now wants Mel to seek professional and believes she needs to get rid of the \u0027enablers\u0027 who she pays to be around her  A judge ruled that Mel is to be subjected to random drug and alcohol tests for four months - after a bombshell declaration claimed she has been abusing drugs and alcohol while in the custody of her young children      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/00/5019153C00000578-0-image-m-38_1536793254474.jpg","title":"STFU SUSAN Debra Messing reignites feud Susan Sarandon","story":"\u0027You are the strongest, the bravest and the finest among us....MILLIONS of water bottles meant for the victims of Hurricane...Share this articleSarandon, 71, quickly hit back, explaining that she was not celebrating Trump, but was glad to see actual change happening in politics, and more women and people of color being moved to run for election.She snapped at the Will and Grace star not to take Variety\u0027s headline, \u0027Donald Trump has, if anything, inspired more women and people of color to run for office, says actress Susan Sarandon,\u0027 too seriously.    \u0027Debs, before you get yourself all self-righteous try clicking on the video and listening to what I actually say, not @Variety\u0027s clickbait headline, which btw has no quotation marks. That\u0027s a clue..\u0027The actresses, both staunch Democrats, supported different candidates for the 2016 election, with Sarandon supporting Bernie Sanders, and Messing putting her weight behind Hillary Clinton.The feud began when Sarandon, asked by MSNBC\u0027s Chris Hayes who she would vote for if Sanders lost the nomination, said \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m going to see what happens\u0027.Some believed that she was saying she wouldn\u0027t vote at all, or even that she would vote for Trump.           After reading the interview, Messing tweeted: \u0027Susan Sarandon muses that Trump presidency would be better for the country than Hillary. Wonder if she\u0027d say that if she were poor, gay, Muslim or an immigrant.\u0027Sarandon responded: \u0027Watch the interview. Don\u0027t just read the headlines. #Spin.\u0027 She also clarified that she never said she had even considered voting for Trump.\u0027LOL that I would ever vote Trump,\u0027 Sarandon tweeted.The pair then went back and forth on Twitter, with Susan accusing her rival of \u0027RT-ing personal attacks\u0027 against her before finally finishing the exchange by tweeting: \u0027Alright @DebraMessing report me to the homeroom teacher and let\u0027s STOP.\u0027Messing later admitted that she \u0027became a big mouth on Twitter\u0027 while passionately campaigning for Clinton last year. Their feud was revisited last year when Andy Cohen asked socialist Sarandon about the incident during an appearance on his talk show in May.\u0027You know, I think she\u0027s not very well informed, so sometimes she gets in areas that she really hasn’t thought through,\u0027 said Susan.    Uncertain: The actress started a firestorm on Monday, when she told MSNBC\u0027s Chris Hayes she didn\u0027t know how she would vote if the general election came down to Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton           Misunderstood: The actress, who is a supporter of Bernie Sanders, clarified that she never said she would vote for Trump, like some inferred - including fellow actress Debra Messing \u0027She’s Trumpian a little bit like that, so I don’t have anything against her personally.\u0027I just sometimes I have to say, ‘But you don’t have the information.\u0027In Saradon\u0027s latest interview, the Thelma and Louise star, who has been critical of how the Democratic party has been run, said that she wasn\u0027t a fan of Trump\u0027s presidency but that the only positive thing was that \u0027unintentionally, he has energized\u0027 young Democrats.\u0027He was so bumbling, he\u0027s like a character from a cartoon,\u0027 said Sarandon, saying that Trump\u0027s ineptitude had highlighted other issues that had been a problem for a long time, such as deportations and Democrats losing seats.She said that so many more women and people of color were in the primaries and running for governor than ever before. \u0027The cracks are where the light comes through,\u0027 she said, quoting Leonard Cohen."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/14/5020BBAC00000578-6163223-image-m-46_1536847164754.jpg","title":"Prince Harry meets Royal Marine recruits Captain General","story":"The Duke of Sussex is presented with the Sword of honour by Major General Charlie Stickland OBE          Harry larked about with the Invictus Games Racing team\u0027s fleet of cars, including this miniature model           The Duke of Sussex became Captain General Royal Marines in December 2017 and assumed the role in succession to his grandfather The Duke of Edinburgh, who was Captain General for some 64 years          Harry met with William Prosser and his father, Afghan veteran and Royal Marine Kieran Prosser - who was this year part of a \u0027handpicked\u0027 team to take the England football squad through a tough training weekend to instil \u0027Commando Spirit\u0027          Prince Harry got into the spirit of things in the training centre and helped put young new recruits through their paces The Duke watched recruits being put through their paces on a rope course above a freezing tank of water, and saw a number haul themselves out dripping after falling in. Harry, a former Army captain who served in the forces for 10 years, added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be blood, sweat and tears.\u0027Every single time you end up going to bed where you\u0027re crying, or got a sore leg, or an emotional issue to have to deal with - but it is without doubt probably one of the best professions you can ever be involved with.From the Bridge Climb to camping at Fraser Island: The...The Peckish Prince!

The day was celebrated by all the citizens who were invited with many days of drinking, feasting and horse races.Bustle reported that despite starting in October, the celebrations were moved to an earlier date so that it could be celebrated in better weather conditions. Now, starting in September, the last weekend is still usually held in October.Oktoberfest was actually a non-alcoholic event at first and what is now the largest beer drinking festival in the world, did not serve alcohol at the festival itself, but was sold outside the fairgrounds. Now, over 7.5 million litres of beer are consumed every year.The 16-day event is opened by the Mayor of Munich who taps the first keg and declares ‘O’ zapft is!’, which can be roughly translated to ‘it’s tapped’ in English. The first person that drinks is traditionally the Minister-President of the State of Bavaria and only after that, visitors can celebrate.Alongside beer, gingerbread cookies with sweet messages called Lebkuchen hearts are also consumed.           Munich\u0027s deputy mayor Josef Schmid poses for  Oktoberfest 2016 with a Lebkuchen heartThe Telegraph reported that in the past 10 years, Oktoberfest has attracted around six million visitors a year, who all make their way through thousands of sausages, chickens and pretzels.In addition to the drinking and feasting, parades are held alongside a number of fairground rides with many dressing traditional Bavarian garb. With the event being so popular, it is advised that attendees book accommodation and transport are booked well in advance on this website.Oktoberfest 2018Oktoberfest 2018 will start on Saturday, September 22 and go on until October 7, according to Munich’s official event website. While entry to the tents is free, visitors will have to pay for beer, fairground attractions and whatever they purchase at the stalls.Die WiesnThe Munich locals refer to Oktoberfest as ‘die Wiesn’ because of its location, Theresienwiese, which was named after the Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen.The highlight of this event is the Costume and Riflemen’s Parade, which happens on the first Wiesn Sunday every year. In 2018, it will be held on Sunday, September 23 and on the following Sunday, an open-air big band concert is held.Other events include the Parade of Oktoberfest Landlords and Breweries, the Oktoberfest Mass or the Böllerschießen, which is a handheld cannon salute in front of the Bavaria statue.          Kim Kardashian visits the Oktoberfest 2010 at the Hippodrom tent at TheresienwieseOktoberfest MunichTheresienwiese is located a short tram ride away from Munich and is celebrated in a number of tents, as Ludwig and Therese did in 1810. However, the tents that are used today have colourful facades, long wooden tables and benches, holding up to 10,000 visitors.About 70 percent of these visitors are from Bavaria itself and 15 percent from other parts of Germany, but there are a large number of people from abroad also, who tend to be found at the Hofbräu tent.Visitors are also encouraged to visit the other 13 tents, such as the Hackerbräu, which is decked out in Bavarian blue and white and the Winzerer Fähndl, that has its own beer garden.The Augustiner Festhalle is popular with families, particularly on Tuesdays and the largest tent is the 10,000-seater Schottenhamel, where the first beer of the season is poured. The smallest is the Glöckle Wirt, which has room for just 98 people and its walls are covered with traditional instruments, cooking utensils and paintings.Oktoberfest outfitsMany opt to wear lederhosen or dirndl, the traditional Bavarian dress with full skirt, apron and tight bodice. However, many have called into question whether or not ‘sexy’ versions of the dirndl should be worn and if this is cultural appropriation, as reported by The Guardian.Oktoberfest beerOktoberfest regulation states that only beer from Munich’s six breweries: Paulaner, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Augustiner, Hofbräu, and Löwenbräu can be served and like other German brews, Oktoberfest beers must pass the ‘purity’ law, or Reinheitsgebot, passed in 1516 to ensure quality.Oktoberfest beer is served in one-litre glasses and is priced at around  10 Euros. For those who are not partial to beer, there is also a wine tent called the Weinzelt, where visitors can choose from more than 15 different variations.Nintendo Direct September 2018: What we learned from the announcementsHalle Berry net worth revealed as actress announces directorial debut with Bruised film Pornhub traffic dropped during the Apple event revealing iPhone XSCynthia Nixon\u0027s net worth revealed as she battles Cuomo for New York governorIs Game of Thrones star Kit Harington replacing Ben Affleck as Batman?Lil Wayne now owns Young MoneyKanye West and Lil Pump spark I Love It dance challenge after track reveal at PornHub Awards New BTS album to be released in Japan this November How to download iOS 12 before Apple officially release the updateK-pop stars HyunA and E\u0027Dawn kicked off Cube Entertainment label after announcing they\u0027re datingLondon Fashion Week 2018: All you need to knowMercury Prize 2018: Hosts and performers revealed for the Hyundai Mercury Prize Award ceremonyWho is Norm Macdonald?

We had been working together off and on for about three years. \u0027We were coming towards the end of a project and I had to make a final payment.\u0027As it comes to the end of the project, I receive some emails from the builder and they are chatty.\u0027Then, this is probably when I should have heard alarm bells but didn\u0027t, he said the good news is we can pay the money into a UK account, instead of my overseas account where you would have to pay loads more tax.

Wright, left on This Morning, revealed earlier this week his wife Amelia, right with Wright, was pregnant with a baby girl after they went through eight years of IVF treatment\u0027I was going to see him in three days so I thought sure.\u0027My builder came three days later and said \u0027are you going to pay me\u0027, and I said \u0027I already have\u0027.\u0027So what transpired is that my builder\u0027s email was hacked, they read all the email exchange that we had over three years so they knew all the names and all the work we had been doing.\u0027They then copied his email address but changed one letter of his name so it looked broadly the same and I just fell for it hook, line and sinker. Nearly £10,000 out of pocket. So beware, ladies and gentlemen.\u0027He added he went to his bank, who were \u0027off hand\u0027 about getting the money back and told him it would take two weeks.Wright said he then had to spend three hours in an interview and produce a raft of documents, as did his wife.He added the bank told him they could not get the money back from the other account directly in case they were \u0027coerced\u0027.          The broadcaster and his wife shared the news on Twitter, pictured, and thanked wellwishers for their messages of supportA frustrated Wright added: \u0027But I do have a crime number. Hooray.

Woo hoo!\u0027  He later shared the news on his radio show and then wrote on Twitter: \u0027Hope you enjoyed today’s show as much as we did making it...\u0027Ta for all your kind words re @mrsameliawright and pregnancy.

Around a third (34 per cent) of 18 to 24 year-olds were smokers in 2000, but this fell to 23 per cent in 2017.Tory infighting escalates as \u0027new generation\u0027 of MPs demands...Share this articleThe dramatic decline has coincided with the ban on smoking indoors, which came into force in July 2007, and the rise of electronic cigarettes which some people use to try to kick the habit.Although the downward trend has undergone a sudden reversal in the past year - increasing from 18 per cent in 2016 to 23 per cent last year. The sudden uptick comes amid warnings that some young people are being lured into smoking by electronic cigarettes - which come in a variety of fruity flavours.The revelations come as the American authorities announced they could ban the sale of fruity e cigarette flavours in a bid to stop the devices appealing to youngsters.Today\u0027s ONS figures also show that 18 year-olds spend less time socialising and having fun with their friends than they used to.In the year 2000, 18 year-olds spent on average nearly an hour and a half (88 minutes) hanging out with their friends.But this has fallen to just over an hour (61 minutes) in the year 2015, the figures show.           The ONS said that youngsters are spending more time glued to their screens or playing computer games than they used to, and less time socialising with their friends Rather than getting out of the house and socialising, 18 year-olds are spending far more time glued to their computer screans.So, while in 2000 they spent on average 12 minutes a day \u0027computing\u0027  this has grown massively to nearly 29 minutes in 2015.And while 18 year-olds used to just spend 11 minutes a day on \u0027games and computer games\u0027 this has soared to nearly 42 minutes.The figures come amid concerns that young people are spending far too long on their computers and smart phones on Facebook and Snapchat.ONS said: \u0027The internet was a very different place at the start of the century – with no Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube or Instagram – and no smartphones or tablets to access it. \u0027The biggest changes to how 18-year-olds spend their time may be driven in part by the rise of digital technology.\u0027Time 18-year-olds spent socialising, which includes meeting friends and family, visiting pubs or cafes, or talking on the phone, declined by 27 minutes per day between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015.\u0027Time spent computing, which includes using social media, went up by 17 minutes per day, while 18-year-olds spent an additional 31 minutes playing games including computer games. \u0027There was also a rise in the amount of time spent on sport and exercise, up by 8 minutes per day.

He\u0027s inciting violence, he\u0027s inciting civil war, in my opinion,\u0027 he said.\u0027And when you start attacking someone for a stupid comment, that feeds into that desire on his part to split us down the middle.\u0027So I don\u0027t want to think of Roseanne as an enemy because she said something really stupid and offensive, I just don\u0027t want to, I\u0027m not going to go down that road.\u0027It starts with the president of the United States, trying to find ways to ide us and to create violence in the end, and I don\u0027t want to be a part of that.\u0027 Schiff spoke exclusively to DailyMailTV as he attended TV Legend Ed Asner\u0027s 6th Annual Celebrity Poker Tournament raising funds for autism, in Los Angeles.Schiff\u0027s comments come in the wake of comic Norm Macdonald facing a firestorm for insinuating that Roseanne and Louis C.K. deserved a second chance.Macdonald\u0027s comments saw Jimmy Fallon cancel an appearance on Tuesday\u0027s Tonight Show, then Macdonald telling Howard Stern on his Wednesday Sirius XM radio show his comments had been misconstrued, only to create more controversy.In his initial interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said \u0027I do think that at some point it will end with a completely innocent person of prominence sticking a gun in his head and ending it.

The Kennedy family is pictured above left to right: Edward, Jeane, Robert, Patricia, Eunice, Kathleen, Rosemary, John F. Kennedy, Rose Kennedy and Joseph P. KennedyAt age 19, her father was appointed the US Ambassador to Great Britain and the family moved to London where she attended a convent school.It was during this period she began to gain weight, which was not acceptable by her father who wrote to her school about it and said: \u0027She is getting all together too fat and I told her in no uncertain terms.\u0027When she reached her early 20s, Rosemary was deemed unmanageable by her parents since she had grown into a beautiful young woman.Her father had begun to focus on his sons\u0027 political careers around this period and felt that Rosemary could damage the family\u0027s name if she fell pregnant.In an effort to gain more control over her, Joseph spoke to his wife about a new experimental brain surgery known as a lobotomy. But upon looking into the procedure, their daughter Kathleen Kennedy said: \u0027It\u0027s nothing we want for Rosie\u0027. However, Joseph disregarded her advice and went ahead with procedure for Rosemary without telling anyone including his wife.Rosemary\u0027s nephew, Timothy Shriver, wrote in his 2014 book Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most, that the \u0027chilling\u0027 procedure involved doctors cutting into the brain while the patient was still conscious and only stopping once the patient could no longer speak.

Joseph sent Rosemary away to a facility where she was hidden from her mother and siblings for years until he had a stroke in the 1960s and they discovered the secret of what happened to her. Eventually she was taken out on visits by her family members until her death in 2005. She is pictured above left next to her sister JeanHe wrote: \u0027The outcome, in Rosemary\u0027s case, was devastating.\u0027Her mobility was damaged, she couldn\u0027t speak and \u0027she lost her independence for the rest of her life,\u0027 Shriver wrote.Rose later claimed that her husband, who refused to visit Rosemary after the procedure due to his guilt, did not reveal that she underwent a lobotomy for 20 years.\u0027The code of secrecy kicked in and Rosemary disappeared,\u0027 Shriver wrote.The Kennedy family traveled to Wisconsin to visit Rosemary for the first time in 1961 after Joseph suffered a stroke.Rosemary was being escorted by two nuns and broke away into a sprint to lunge at her mother and screamed at her. Her siblings also reportedly didn\u0027t know what happened to her and thought she worked as a teacher and lived in the Midwest until that visit.Her siblings visited her often and she was occasionally taken on visits out of the facility.She died on January 7, 2005– the first of Joseph and Rose Kennedy\u0027s children to die from natural causes.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/01/5026114A00000578-6166295-image-a-2_1536884392965.jpg","title":"Twitter ridicules Salisbury assassins hilarious memes","story":"        Novichok in their hotel room, no photos of them at the...Nervously turning their chairs and leaning forward to assert...Share this article        Some created memes lampooning their Salisbury story, which Theresa May called an insult \u0027to the public\u0027s intelligence\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/00/03918F43000007D0-0-image-a-8_1536881414064.jpg","title":"BBC presenter Mishal Husain opens self doubt","story":"BBC bosses say they can end the infuriating delay on its...One Show presenter Anita Rani, 40, hits out at...\u0027I want valuable time with Freddie\u0027: Rachael Bland\u0027s final...Share this article\u0027It was my husband who right at the beginning said to me, \u0027you can\u0027t not go for something because it\u0027s too hard.

On a scale of one to seven – with seven enjoying something ‘very much’ – housework came in at 4.5 for men, above 4.4 for their paid job.Dr Pierre Walthery, who conducted the study, said it may be because men do less scrubbing and more DIY when it comes to housework, while women spend more time on dreary chores.\u0027Looking for a personal slave?\u0027 Mother is slammed for...The chore wars: American men may be helping out more around...Do you have more dollars than sense?

He said: ‘We know from previous research that men of childbearing age tend to work longer hours than women and that they complain more about it. For women, on the other hand, work can be an escape from the responsibilities of being at home and the unpaid work they do there.’Participants were asked to rate their daily activities every ten minutes in a diary, with women grading housework at 4.4, below an enjoyment score of 4.5 for work. The results suggest that women are more stoic about having to work early or late at night.          Men put domestic chores such as cleaning, above work, while it is the opposite for womenDr Walthery, who will present his results today at the British Sociological Association’s employment conference in Belfast, added: ‘Women are more likely to do caring jobs, which include nursing and childcare, and this may explain the difference, as we know these jobs provide more enjoyment. However self-employment has a more positive effect on men than women, this study showed, so that could make work more appealing than housework for them.’The Centre for Time Use Research at the University of Oxford found both sexes rated activities such as socialising, caring for others, doing volunteer work and cultural events as more enjoyable than paid work, typically scoring them six out of seven."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/14/01/44FC9E1C00000578-6166375-image-a-35_1536886777137.jpg","title":"Labour MP Chi Onwurah claims 250 expenses pay voice coach","story":"    Chi Onwurah filed the claim under the headline \u0027training\u0027 for a £250 voice coach (Chi Onwurah pictured left with MP Jack Dromy right at lobbying event in London)A Labour MP claimed £250 in expenses to pay for a voice coach, official documents show.The latest tranche from the expenses watchdog shows Chi Onwurah filed the claim under the headline \u0027training\u0027.

Don\u0027t laugh — this was part of a scientific experiment, to ensure the chicks recognised me from the moment they were born and adopted me as their mother.Or, to give myself some dignity, their father. I am Papa Goose.When I first met them they were large white eggs in an incubator, in the basement of the Max Planck Institute For Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany, close to the border with Switzerland.The contraption looks a bit like a convection oven, with warm air circulated to distribute it evenly at 37.5C (99.5F) — no more, no less.Share this articleThe whole thing is a fully automated version of a mother goose\u0027s underside, though I had to take the eggs out to cool every day for half an hour, before misting them with cold water and replacing them in the incubator.This mimics conditions in the wild when mama leaves the nest briefly to take a dip, and returns with a wet bottom.The goal was for the geese, when grown, to wear small data loggers on their backs, which would capture information to help researchers build a precise picture of the birds\u0027 flight dynamics.A successful project could lead, we hoped, to mounting these devices on birds all over the world, collecting meteorological data to be relayed back via satellite.I was chosen to be Papa Goose because I could fly. But the timing was difficult. I was newly orced and the break-up was stressful.I couldn\u0027t neglect the goose eggs, but I also didn\u0027t want to take time away from my children, Amelie and Ronin. I wasn\u0027t sure if I had the emotional resources for looking after a clutch of baby geese.So apart from the need to get the unhatched chicks used to my voice, one reason I was reading aloud to the eggs was to keep myself calm. I chose The Wonderful Adventures Of Nils, a Swedish tale about a boy who flies away on the back of a farm goose.          Relaxing with Papa Goose: Michael takes a break with his goslings Baby geese aren\u0027t picky about choosing their parents. They latch onto whatever they first see after hatching: it might be a human, a doll or even a football.I also placed one of my musty old T-shirts into the incubator next to the eggs, because smell is important in goose recognition. And I accustomised them to two other sounds, apart from my voice: a recording of the Ultralight plane\u0027s engine, and the honk of a metal horn with a black rubber bulb.A day before hatching, I heard the first soft peep from inside an egg. At 7am next day the first cracks appeared, and I was giddy with emotion. It was almost like being 15 again and falling in love.\u0027Papa\u0027s here waiting for you,\u0027 I said softly to the eggs — and at the sound of my voice they all started peeping excitedly.          Cheek to cheek: Michael quickly bonded with the new chicks At my daughter\u0027s insistence, I named the firstborn gosling Gloria — mistaking him for a girl goose. It took the chick an hour to break through the shell with her \u0027egg tooth\u0027, a horny growth on the bill that disappears after hatching.It\u0027s no accident the eggs didn\u0027t all hatch at once: the mother goose can\u0027t care for six newborns simultaneously. It\u0027s even thought that, still in the egg, goslings peep to establish a hatching order.Gloria tried to lift her head in my direction but she was too weak. She just lay in the incubator, recovering her strength.The first physical contact is critical. If Gloria was to accept me, she had to be close and soak me up with all her senses. So I lifted her gently to my mouth and whispered my best goose noises: \u0027Gagagaga! Weeweeweeweewee!\u0027Then I tucked her under my jumper, against my skin. For the next few weeks, my home was a trailer in the institute grounds, nicknamed Duckingham Palace. I laid Gloria in the laundry basket that was to be her bed — but she responded with desperate peeps.She didn\u0027t want to be alone. I slipped her back under my sweater. That night, when she was still the only chick to have hatched, I put her on a towel next to my head.          Follow the leader: Michael and his seven goslings go for a swim in a lakeThat was no good: within five seconds she had slithered under the duvet and back onto my chest, where she gave her \u0027sleepy call\u0027. It sounds like someone gently blowing into a whistle. I lay there, unable to sleep for fear of rolling on her, without moving all night.Next day, my eyes were opened at 5.15am by the sound of a cuckoo outside the trailer window. I squinted, and saw a golden fluffball sitting on my chest. Her contented peeps seemed to say: \u0027Isn\u0027t it great, Papa? I was awake anyway!\u0027That day, Gloria got six brothers and sisters. As soon as I took them all back to the trailer, we had a good cuddle. It felt wonderful, because goslings are so soft, but it also meant I had to change my shirt within the hour. Baby geese are world-class poopers.AS NIGHT fell, I placed them all together in the laundry basket on the floor, but they would only settle when I dangled one of my hands over the side of the bed and touched them.If I tried to remove it, they peeped pitifully. The goslings needed me as unconditionally as a human baby needs its parents.          Keep up kids! Michael on a stroll with his seven goslingsI was an unlikely father for geese. I wasn\u0027t vegetarian, but now — suddenly — I couldn\u0027t stomach the thought of eating any bird. When a colleague brought me a chicken curry takeaway, I had to pick out all the meat.I was soon used to rising at 5.15am. The goslings gave me no choice. They travelled under my jumper, where they formed a heated feather pillow with a mind of its own.When they were three days old, I put out a paddling pool. Nemo was first to jump in — he needed no demonstrations — but soon all the chicks were frolicking happily, splashing and playing submarines.They were already becoming independent and, that evening, I placed my old T-shirt in their basket. They seemed to accept this as a substitute for my hand. I finally got a good night\u0027s sleep.Before long, they were ready for a real lake. I donned my brand-new rubber wetsuit, which caused all the chicks to eye me with a touch of suspicion. But they soon forgot their worries, and were splashing and ing in the cold water. My head was surrounded by seven gabbling feather balls, all greatly enjoying themselves.I was beginning to notice an unexpected change in myself, too. Thanks to the geese, I was finding it easier to accept that, following my orce, I wasn\u0027t able to see my own children all the time.The first time I took them to the meadow that was to be our runway, I was sitting on the grass, surrounded by my chicks, when I looked up and saw three hawks — two kites and a buzzard. I was horrified. How could I have been so careless and unaware of the circling dangers?Shouting and whirling my coat, I led the goslings to safety. The hawks got the message: don\u0027t mess with Papa Goose. The next day, I showed the birds the electric Ultralight for the first time.I wheeled it out of the barn and started the propellor. They didn\u0027t take much notice.Seizing the horn, I honked it loudly three times and shouted: \u0027Ready?\u0027 Then I set off on foot at a sprint over the grass.The little geese raced after me like seven golden tennis balls. It warmed my heart to see them running with their stubby wings outstretched, eager to be reunited with their Papa Goose.After a few runs, I led them to the shade of the plane\u0027s wing, to help them feel safe with it.Seeing how confident the geese were with humans, I started taking them to a popular town lake, usually crowded with sunbathers.People did a double-take at the sight of a man with seven growing geese at his heel, and children wanted to stroke them.Soon, the geese were too large to register on the predatory buzzards\u0027 radar as potential snacks.And then the moment of truth . . . We stood on a grassy hill and the geese were lined up behind me.I looked at the meadow below us, stretched out my arms, and called to them. I honked the horn and ran down the slope, waving my arms, a rowdy gaggle of seven adolescent geese trailing behind me.I had to be careful not to trip over my feet, especially when Calimero, Freddy, and Glorio flew past a few feet off the ground, necks stretched forward and wings fully extended. They were flying. Really flying!My GEESE were full of surprises, not least when I took a sample of blood from each of them and sent it for DNA analysis. The results showed that all seven were in fact male. That seemed improbable, but true. Some name changes were necessary — Gloria became Glorio and Frieda became Freddy.Nemo\u0027s weight was a worry. Once his brothers started flying, he preferred to stay on the ground, eating dandelions.Eventually, even he took to the air, and we soared together as if we\u0027d been doing it all our lives. I was surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving heads. The geese became so familiar with the Ultralight that they began to gabble loudly as soon as they saw it from afar. It was time for my first flight with them.I climbed into the cockpit and taxied slowly toward the start of the runway. The geese were in a crate under the right wing.Nervousness spread through my system. \u0027Now! Off we go!\u0027 I called, and Laura opened the crate.I squeezed the horn with all my might. The geese stormed out of the crate, and we raced down the runway together. Nils was first to fly, then Glorio, and I found myself surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving necks.We were flying together for the first time. \u0027Yippee!\u0027I saw something close up that most bird-watchers only see through binoculars if lucky — goose aerobatics. They will turn onto their backs in mid-air and e towards the ground before righting themselves. It seems they do it just because they can.My favourite manoeuvre was the landing: almost vertically, no need for a runway, coming down on their feet as gracefully as helicopters.          A grelag goose, the goslings will grow to the size of this goose (pictured) If I had a favourite, I suppose it was Paul. He was such an affectionate creature. But it was Paul who first left home, at least briefly. I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised: in the wild, greylag geese stay with their parents for a few weeks or less, and by now my birds had been with me several months.A sudden storm scattered the flock. I expected them to come flapping back at once, but it took a lot of calling and honking before they returned. All except Paul.Hours passed, and I was beginning to despair, when I spotted a V-shaped flight of wild geese, high above. Something told me one of those specks belonged to me.Grabbing the horn, I honked and honked. The goose at the back peeled off, quickly lost altitude and landed in the next field. He hopped rather than waddled towards me.I buried my nose in his neck and breathed in the scent of his feathers. Right at this point, adult geese still smell like little goslings.But geese don\u0027t make good pets. They can never be house-broken. And mine were always yearning to be independent. Gradually, my flock began to break up.Rebel Freddy was the first to go. He became disobedient, refusing to fly with the rest. I tried setting him free on a lake, but a few days later when I checked on him, I could see he had not been eating.To compound the problem, when I returned him to the aviary, the other birds didn\u0027t want to know him. Only Maddin was still prepared to be his friend.Then, tragically, we lost Nemo. He injured his neck in the aviary, no one knows how. The vet was unable to save him, and he had to be put down. I was bitterly upset and desolated a second time when, following a successful flight, another microlight aircraft panicked Paul. He flew off, and I never saw him again. I can only hope he rejoined that wild flock.Clearly, it was time to find permanent homes for the other birds. Calimero and Nils were taken in by a wildlife park, and now they make friends with visitors every day.Freddy and Maddin discovered their vocation, pestering visitors at the boating lake for scraps of bread and crumbs from the cafe tables. They are doing well on it.Glorio, eldest of the brothers, answered the call of the wild. Twice I saw him on a small pond next to the airfield, in the midst of a group of greylags.He seemed so completely independent it was only by his red leg-band that I could positively identify him. I don\u0027t know if he noticed me, but I watched the geese as they flew away until they were nothing more than black dots on the horizon. For one brief moment, I was proud just like a real dad.During our experiment together, we made more than 60 flights and I gathered a colossal amount of data, enough for several PhD theses. We also proved that data loggers can be carried by geese in flight without any hindrance, opening the way for this method to be used by meteorologists all round the world.But most of all, my seven goslings helped me find myself again after orce. I used to fight and rage against the complications of my life. The geese showed me what really matters: loving others and loving life itself.Adapted from Papa Goose: One Year, Seven Goslings And The Flight Of My Life by Michael Quetting (Greystone Books, £16.99). © Michael Quetting 2018.To order a copy for £13.59 (offer valid to September 20, 2018 p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.Shop Books \u0026amp DVDs at MailShop.co.uk"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/22/5025072600000578-0-image-a-40_1536874347046.jpg","title":"New iPhones big women hold","story":"    Apple has been criticised for designing iPhones too big for women\u0027s handsAfter announcing the launch of its new range on Wednesday, four other iPhone models were removed from Apple\u0027s website.

Chadwick, from Westhoughton, Bolton, admitted one count of stalking without fear, alarm or distress at Manchester Magistrates Court and was handed an 18-month restraining orderHe was also conditionally discharged for 18 months.  Prosecutor Lynn Rogers had told the court: \u0027The two met by complete chance.\u0027She was out walking in February 2016, when she saw him and they started to chat, and they had a cup of tea together and arranged to meet for lunch.\u0027She took him to a local centre where she works as a volunteer. He asked if he could also volunteer but was told it would not be appropriate. \u0027He followed her to her place of worship, and would send her hand-written letters, and hand-deliver them through her front door.\u0027At the centre he was spoken to by staff and asked him if the reason he wanted to volunteer for them was because he wanted to be close to her and he said yes. \u0027He was told not to attend the centre anymore.\u0027He was reported in 2016 and March 2017 as she saw him walking down her cul-de-sac. \u0027He went up to her house and he knocked on the door and rang the bell to try to contact her. \u0027She remained in her house and the curtains were drawn in the front.\u0027She said he was seen by a neighbour and he was loitering around the area, and posted letters and a book through her door.\u0027Chadwick later attended a police station on August 21, 2018 where he was arrested. In mitigation defence lawyer Adam Whittaker said: \u0027He had impeccable character and it is unfortunate we have to be in this situation today.\u0027He just didn\u0027t understand what has happened. He does have difficulties with hearing, and he communicates by letters.\u0027He lost his wife on Christmas Day a few years ago, just as they were approaching their 50th wedding anniversary and she was his life companion.\u0027His family have grown up and he find great comfort in the church. On the first meeting with her he had his bible, and he was working on a question from his minister.\u0027She approached him and spoke to him first. After they swapped numbers, she contacted him after that and they met for lunch. \u0027They went to each other\u0027s place of workshop.\u0027He felt there was more to this friendship than there actually was. He wanted to see her.\u0027She told him to then not contact her for three months and he thought maybe that would salvage their friendship. \u0027He didn\u0027t know why or what he did wrong.

Probation do not need to be involved with a man of 88 years of age.\u0027District judge Khalid Qureshi dismissed the need for punishment, and said: \u0027There was no malice involved and there was no threat, it was just the persistence of the matter.\u0027I will make this a conditional discharge for 18 months.

Around a third (34 per cent) of 18 to 24 year-olds were smokers in 2000, but this fell to 23 per cent in 2017.Tory infighting escalates as \u0027new generation\u0027 of MPs demands...Share this articleThe dramatic decline has coincided with the ban on smoking indoors, which came into force in July 2007, and the rise of electronic cigarettes which some people use to try to kick the habit.Although the downward trend has undergone a sudden reversal in the past year - increasing from 18 per cent in 2016 to 23 per cent last year. The sudden uptick comes amid warnings that some young people are being lured into smoking by electronic cigarettes - which come in a variety of fruity flavours.The revelations come as the American authorities announced they could ban the sale of fruity e cigarette flavours in a bid to stop the devices appealing to youngsters.Today\u0027s ONS figures also show that 18 year-olds spend less time socialising and having fun with their friends than they used to.In the year 2000, 18 year-olds spent on average nearly an hour and a half (88 minutes) hanging out with their friends.But this has fallen to just over an hour (61 minutes) in the year 2015, the figures show.           The ONS said that youngsters are spending more time glued to their screens or playing computer games than they used to, and less time socialising with their friends Rather than getting out of the house and socialising, 18 year-olds are spending far more time glued to their computer screans.So, while in 2000 they spent on average 12 minutes a day \u0027computing\u0027  this has grown massively to nearly 29 minutes in 2015.And while 18 year-olds used to just spend 11 minutes a day on \u0027games and computer games\u0027 this has soared to nearly 42 minutes.The figures come amid concerns that young people are spending far too long on their computers and smart phones on Facebook and Snapchat.ONS said: \u0027The internet was a very different place at the start of the century – with no Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube or Instagram – and no smartphones or tablets to access it. \u0027The biggest changes to how 18-year-olds spend their time may be driven in part by the rise of digital technology.\u0027Time 18-year-olds spent socialising, which includes meeting friends and family, visiting pubs or cafes, or talking on the phone, declined by 27 minutes per day between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015.\u0027Time spent computing, which includes using social media, went up by 17 minutes per day, while 18-year-olds spent an additional 31 minutes playing games including computer games. \u0027There was also a rise in the amount of time spent on sport and exercise, up by 8 minutes per day.

Around 27,000 fled as refugees to the UK, where they could settle as they still had British passports. The rest mainly moved to India, Canada and neighbouring Kenya. Some smuggled their jewellery out of the country, which they sold to buy businesses in their new lands.

On a scale of one to seven – with seven enjoying something ‘very much’ – housework came in at 4.5 for men, above 4.4 for their paid job.Dr Pierre Walthery, who conducted the study, said it may be because men do less scrubbing and more DIY when it comes to housework, while women spend more time on dreary chores.\u0027Looking for a personal slave?\u0027 Mother is slammed for...The chore wars: American men may be helping out more around...Do you have more dollars than sense?

He said: ‘We know from previous research that men of childbearing age tend to work longer hours than women and that they complain more about it. For women, on the other hand, work can be an escape from the responsibilities of being at home and the unpaid work they do there.’Participants were asked to rate their daily activities every ten minutes in a diary, with women grading housework at 4.4, below an enjoyment score of 4.5 for work. The results suggest that women are more stoic about having to work early or late at night.          Men put domestic chores such as cleaning, above work, while it is the opposite for womenDr Walthery, who will present his results today at the British Sociological Association’s employment conference in Belfast, added: ‘Women are more likely to do caring jobs, which include nursing and childcare, and this may explain the difference, as we know these jobs provide more enjoyment. However self-employment has a more positive effect on men than women, this study showed, so that could make work more appealing than housework for them.’The Centre for Time Use Research at the University of Oxford found both sexes rated activities such as socialising, caring for others, doing volunteer work and cultural events as more enjoyable than paid work, typically scoring them six out of seven."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/17/4F9B000D00000578-0-image-m-11_1535820897256.jpg","title":"Man raises seven baby geese children teaching fly","story":"    Pictured above the Ultralight aircraft described in Michael Quetting\u0027s new bookNemo races along madly behind, flapping his wings and calling loudly, before giving up with a heartrending honk. But the others are soaring with me. This is it — I am flying with my goose family. I raised these birds from chicks and now we are flying together.In fact, I knew my geese long before they hatched. I even read them stories while they were still in the egg. Don\u0027t laugh — this was part of a scientific experiment, to ensure the chicks recognised me from the moment they were born and adopted me as their mother.Or, to give myself some dignity, their father. I am Papa Goose.When I first met them they were large white eggs in an incubator, in the basement of the Max Planck Institute For Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany, close to the border with Switzerland.The contraption looks a bit like a convection oven, with warm air circulated to distribute it evenly at 37.5C (99.5F) — no more, no less.Share this articleThe whole thing is a fully automated version of a mother goose\u0027s underside, though I had to take the eggs out to cool every day for half an hour, before misting them with cold water and replacing them in the incubator.This mimics conditions in the wild when mama leaves the nest briefly to take a dip, and returns with a wet bottom.The goal was for the geese, when grown, to wear small data loggers on their backs, which would capture information to help researchers build a precise picture of the birds\u0027 flight dynamics.A successful project could lead, we hoped, to mounting these devices on birds all over the world, collecting meteorological data to be relayed back via satellite.I was chosen to be Papa Goose because I could fly. But the timing was difficult. I was newly orced and the break-up was stressful.I couldn\u0027t neglect the goose eggs, but I also didn\u0027t want to take time away from my children, Amelie and Ronin. I wasn\u0027t sure if I had the emotional resources for looking after a clutch of baby geese.So apart from the need to get the unhatched chicks used to my voice, one reason I was reading aloud to the eggs was to keep myself calm. I chose The Wonderful Adventures Of Nils, a Swedish tale about a boy who flies away on the back of a farm goose.          Relaxing with Papa Goose: Michael takes a break with his goslings Baby geese aren\u0027t picky about choosing their parents. They latch onto whatever they first see after hatching: it might be a human, a doll or even a football.I also placed one of my musty old T-shirts into the incubator next to the eggs, because smell is important in goose recognition. And I accustomised them to two other sounds, apart from my voice: a recording of the Ultralight plane\u0027s engine, and the honk of a metal horn with a black rubber bulb.A day before hatching, I heard the first soft peep from inside an egg. At 7am next day the first cracks appeared, and I was giddy with emotion. It was almost like being 15 again and falling in love.\u0027Papa\u0027s here waiting for you,\u0027 I said softly to the eggs — and at the sound of my voice they all started peeping excitedly.          Cheek to cheek: Michael quickly bonded with the new chicks At my daughter\u0027s insistence, I named the firstborn gosling Gloria — mistaking him for a girl goose. It took the chick an hour to break through the shell with her \u0027egg tooth\u0027, a horny growth on the bill that disappears after hatching.It\u0027s no accident the eggs didn\u0027t all hatch at once: the mother goose can\u0027t care for six newborns simultaneously. It\u0027s even thought that, still in the egg, goslings peep to establish a hatching order.Gloria tried to lift her head in my direction but she was too weak. She just lay in the incubator, recovering her strength.The first physical contact is critical. If Gloria was to accept me, she had to be close and soak me up with all her senses. So I lifted her gently to my mouth and whispered my best goose noises: \u0027Gagagaga! Weeweeweeweewee!\u0027Then I tucked her under my jumper, against my skin. For the next few weeks, my home was a trailer in the institute grounds, nicknamed Duckingham Palace. I laid Gloria in the laundry basket that was to be her bed — but she responded with desperate peeps.She didn\u0027t want to be alone. I slipped her back under my sweater. That night, when she was still the only chick to have hatched, I put her on a towel next to my head.          Follow the leader: Michael and his seven goslings go for a swim in a lakeThat was no good: within five seconds she had slithered under the duvet and back onto my chest, where she gave her \u0027sleepy call\u0027. It sounds like someone gently blowing into a whistle. I lay there, unable to sleep for fear of rolling on her, without moving all night.Next day, my eyes were opened at 5.15am by the sound of a cuckoo outside the trailer window. I squinted, and saw a golden fluffball sitting on my chest. Her contented peeps seemed to say: \u0027Isn\u0027t it great, Papa? I was awake anyway!\u0027That day, Gloria got six brothers and sisters. As soon as I took them all back to the trailer, we had a good cuddle. It felt wonderful, because goslings are so soft, but it also meant I had to change my shirt within the hour. Baby geese are world-class poopers.AS NIGHT fell, I placed them all together in the laundry basket on the floor, but they would only settle when I dangled one of my hands over the side of the bed and touched them.If I tried to remove it, they peeped pitifully. The goslings needed me as unconditionally as a human baby needs its parents.          Keep up kids! Michael on a stroll with his seven goslingsI was an unlikely father for geese. I wasn\u0027t vegetarian, but now — suddenly — I couldn\u0027t stomach the thought of eating any bird. When a colleague brought me a chicken curry takeaway, I had to pick out all the meat.I was soon used to rising at 5.15am. The goslings gave me no choice. They travelled under my jumper, where they formed a heated feather pillow with a mind of its own.When they were three days old, I put out a paddling pool. Nemo was first to jump in — he needed no demonstrations — but soon all the chicks were frolicking happily, splashing and playing submarines.They were already becoming independent and, that evening, I placed my old T-shirt in their basket. They seemed to accept this as a substitute for my hand. I finally got a good night\u0027s sleep.Before long, they were ready for a real lake. I donned my brand-new rubber wetsuit, which caused all the chicks to eye me with a touch of suspicion. But they soon forgot their worries, and were splashing and ing in the cold water. My head was surrounded by seven gabbling feather balls, all greatly enjoying themselves.I was beginning to notice an unexpected change in myself, too. Thanks to the geese, I was finding it easier to accept that, following my orce, I wasn\u0027t able to see my own children all the time.The first time I took them to the meadow that was to be our runway, I was sitting on the grass, surrounded by my chicks, when I looked up and saw three hawks — two kites and a buzzard. I was horrified. How could I have been so careless and unaware of the circling dangers?Shouting and whirling my coat, I led the goslings to safety. The hawks got the message: don\u0027t mess with Papa Goose. The next day, I showed the birds the electric Ultralight for the first time.I wheeled it out of the barn and started the propellor. They didn\u0027t take much notice.Seizing the horn, I honked it loudly three times and shouted: \u0027Ready?\u0027 Then I set off on foot at a sprint over the grass.The little geese raced after me like seven golden tennis balls. It warmed my heart to see them running with their stubby wings outstretched, eager to be reunited with their Papa Goose.After a few runs, I led them to the shade of the plane\u0027s wing, to help them feel safe with it.Seeing how confident the geese were with humans, I started taking them to a popular town lake, usually crowded with sunbathers.People did a double-take at the sight of a man with seven growing geese at his heel, and children wanted to stroke them.Soon, the geese were too large to register on the predatory buzzards\u0027 radar as potential snacks.And then the moment of truth . . . We stood on a grassy hill and the geese were lined up behind me.I looked at the meadow below us, stretched out my arms, and called to them. I honked the horn and ran down the slope, waving my arms, a rowdy gaggle of seven adolescent geese trailing behind me.I had to be careful not to trip over my feet, especially when Calimero, Freddy, and Glorio flew past a few feet off the ground, necks stretched forward and wings fully extended. They were flying. Really flying!My GEESE were full of surprises, not least when I took a sample of blood from each of them and sent it for DNA analysis. The results showed that all seven were in fact male. That seemed improbable, but true. Some name changes were necessary — Gloria became Glorio and Frieda became Freddy.Nemo\u0027s weight was a worry. Once his brothers started flying, he preferred to stay on the ground, eating dandelions.Eventually, even he took to the air, and we soared together as if we\u0027d been doing it all our lives. I was surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving heads. The geese became so familiar with the Ultralight that they began to gabble loudly as soon as they saw it from afar. It was time for my first flight with them.I climbed into the cockpit and taxied slowly toward the start of the runway. The geese were in a crate under the right wing.Nervousness spread through my system. \u0027Now! Off we go!\u0027 I called, and Laura opened the crate.I squeezed the horn with all my might. The geese stormed out of the crate, and we raced down the runway together. Nils was first to fly, then Glorio, and I found myself surrounded by beating wings and rhythmically moving necks.We were flying together for the first time. \u0027Yippee!\u0027I saw something close up that most bird-watchers only see through binoculars if lucky — goose aerobatics. They will turn onto their backs in mid-air and e towards the ground before righting themselves. It seems they do it just because they can.My favourite manoeuvre was the landing: almost vertically, no need for a runway, coming down on their feet as gracefully as helicopters.          A grelag goose, the goslings will grow to the size of this goose (pictured) If I had a favourite, I suppose it was Paul. He was such an affectionate creature. But it was Paul who first left home, at least briefly. I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised: in the wild, greylag geese stay with their parents for a few weeks or less, and by now my birds had been with me several months.A sudden storm scattered the flock. I expected them to come flapping back at once, but it took a lot of calling and honking before they returned. All except Paul.Hours passed, and I was beginning to despair, when I spotted a V-shaped flight of wild geese, high above. Something told me one of those specks belonged to me.Grabbing the horn, I honked and honked. The goose at the back peeled off, quickly lost altitude and landed in the next field. He hopped rather than waddled towards me.I buried my nose in his neck and breathed in the scent of his feathers. Right at this point, adult geese still smell like little goslings.But geese don\u0027t make good pets. They can never be house-broken. And mine were always yearning to be independent. Gradually, my flock began to break up.Rebel Freddy was the first to go. He became disobedient, refusing to fly with the rest. I tried setting him free on a lake, but a few days later when I checked on him, I could see he had not been eating.To compound the problem, when I returned him to the aviary, the other birds didn\u0027t want to know him. Only Maddin was still prepared to be his friend.Then, tragically, we lost Nemo. He injured his neck in the aviary, no one knows how. The vet was unable to save him, and he had to be put down. I was bitterly upset and desolated a second time when, following a successful flight, another microlight aircraft panicked Paul. He flew off, and I never saw him again. I can only hope he rejoined that wild flock.Clearly, it was time to find permanent homes for the other birds. Calimero and Nils were taken in by a wildlife park, and now they make friends with visitors every day.Freddy and Maddin discovered their vocation, pestering visitors at the boating lake for scraps of bread and crumbs from the cafe tables. They are doing well on it.Glorio, eldest of the brothers, answered the call of the wild. Twice I saw him on a small pond next to the airfield, in the midst of a group of greylags.He seemed so completely independent it was only by his red leg-band that I could positively identify him. I don\u0027t know if he noticed me, but I watched the geese as they flew away until they were nothing more than black dots on the horizon. For one brief moment, I was proud just like a real dad.During our experiment together, we made more than 60 flights and I gathered a colossal amount of data, enough for several PhD theses. We also proved that data loggers can be carried by geese in flight without any hindrance, opening the way for this method to be used by meteorologists all round the world.But most of all, my seven goslings helped me find myself again after orce. I used to fight and rage against the complications of my life. The geese showed me what really matters: loving others and loving life itself.Adapted from Papa Goose: One Year, Seven Goslings And The Flight Of My Life by Michael Quetting (Greystone Books, £16.99). © Michael Quetting 2018.To order a copy for £13.59 (offer valid to September 20, 2018 p\u0026ampp free on orders over £15), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640.Shop Books \u0026amp DVDs at MailShop.co.uk"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/22/5025072600000578-0-image-a-40_1536874347046.jpg","title":"New iPhones big women hold","story":"    Apple has been criticised for designing iPhones too big for women\u0027s handsAfter announcing the launch of its new range on Wednesday, four other iPhone models were removed from Apple\u0027s website.

Chadwick, from Westhoughton, Bolton, admitted one count of stalking without fear, alarm or distress at Manchester Magistrates Court and was handed an 18-month restraining orderHe was also conditionally discharged for 18 months.  Prosecutor Lynn Rogers had told the court: \u0027The two met by complete chance.\u0027She was out walking in February 2016, when she saw him and they started to chat, and they had a cup of tea together and arranged to meet for lunch.\u0027She took him to a local centre where she works as a volunteer. He asked if he could also volunteer but was told it would not be appropriate. \u0027He followed her to her place of worship, and would send her hand-written letters, and hand-deliver them through her front door.\u0027At the centre he was spoken to by staff and asked him if the reason he wanted to volunteer for them was because he wanted to be close to her and he said yes. \u0027He was told not to attend the centre anymore.\u0027He was reported in 2016 and March 2017 as she saw him walking down her cul-de-sac. \u0027He went up to her house and he knocked on the door and rang the bell to try to contact her. \u0027She remained in her house and the curtains were drawn in the front.\u0027She said he was seen by a neighbour and he was loitering around the area, and posted letters and a book through her door.\u0027Chadwick later attended a police station on August 21, 2018 where he was arrested. In mitigation defence lawyer Adam Whittaker said: \u0027He had impeccable character and it is unfortunate we have to be in this situation today.\u0027He just didn\u0027t understand what has happened.

From getting away from phones to a confidence boost, she was intrigued about what members got out of itby  Alison Flood and photographs by Alejandra Carles-TolraSophie Andrews was 16 when she discovered Jane Austen’s novels. Handed Pride and Prejudice as a GCSE text, she was drawn into what has, today, become her all-consuming passion, involving regular Austen-themed holidays, trips to National Trust properties in Regency dress, and as many balls as possible.“I was the only one in the class who enjoyed it and I felt I was I was the only person in the world who loved Jane Austen as much as I did,” says Andrews, who is now 22 and owns more than 100 editions of Pride and Prejudice alone. Less than a year later, she discovered the true extent of Austen fandom online. She started her own blog, and visited the Jane Austen festival in Bath, where she met a group of like-minded people and formed the Jane Austen Pineapple Appreciation Society. “We organised a picnic towards the end of the festival, and two of us said, a bit offhand, wouldn’t it be fun if we all had a house party together?”That house party has now become an annual event, as part of the society’s year-round calendar of Austen-themed social engagements – the Bath Austen festival, an Austen Regency meetup each June, and balls, which are held on a regular basis throughout England. (“You could probably find a ball every two to three weeks, it’s huge,” says Andrews.)The couple dozen in the society are mostly women, and a handful of men. Their day jobs range from doctor to opera singer, biochemist to publisher, but they unite to wear Regency outfits whenever they’re together. Entertainment for their holidays – carefully planned in advance – will range from dances (“We have someone in our group who can call. We roll back the carpet and have great fun!”), to musical evenings and trips to local National Trust properties (in costume, of course).They are not, stresses Andrews, re-enactors. “We like to have non-historically accurate fun,” she says. Cards Against Humanity, she points out, is “very un-Regency”, but they’ve designed their own version, and think Austen herself might have enjoyed their games. “She was quite a cynical person really and had a real sense of humour, a wry wit.”Photographer Alejandra Carles-Tolra came across the society after noticing a group of Regency-clad people in Bath three years ago. Her work explores groups and the iniduals who make them up, so when she found Andrews and her friends, she wanted to find out more.Carles-Tolra has spent days and days embedded with the society, attending their balls, following them around small English villages in their Regency attire, joining them on their getaways. Her new work, Where We Belong, which was enabled by a JerwoodPhotoworks award, explores themes of “belonging, femininity and escapism” through the Austen fans.“It was fascinating to me to think, ‘Why would these women want to adopt an identity from the 19th century?’ It felt to me like going back,” she says. “I wanted to know and understand why they wanted to dress up as 19th-century women.”As Andrews explains it, it’s about “escaping for a week”, to somewhere where “people don’t get their phones out”. “We have a break from the news and everything that’s going on in the real world and have fun and spend time with like-minded people. It’s not quite that you wish you were in the Regency period, with the lack of antibiotics and painkillers and sanitary toilets … It’s about finding people who appreciate the same things we do,” she says. “There is something in the world she creates, an old-fashioned feeling, the manners, the way women were treated by men … It was a very different world than it is today, and there is something very appealing in that.”It’s also about the support of the group. “The majority of them don’t feel that comfortable on their own in Regency clothes, but when they get together with the group it’s like, ‘Now I want to look like I’m mad, now I’m totally fine’,” Carles-Tolra says.After spending time with the society, Carles-Tolra (not an Austen fan herself) realised that many of them found Austen at a time when they were struggling – either with health, or confidence: “Jane Austen’s books became a form of escapism – they could go into this world where, in a very simple way, the good girl gets the good boy and everything is solved.”Andrews fell in love with Austen during a difficult period at school, which coincided with serious health problems in her family. “Jane’s novels became a perfect place for me to escape into, and forget my real world for a few hours,” she says. “She really was my lifeline through the tough few years I had, and continued to be as my own health has suffered in recent years as well, and she has continued to be there for me and to allow me to imagine myself as Lizzy Bennet. She creates a very happy world for us to imagine ourselves in. As she said herself in one of her novels, ‘Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery.’”Andrews once hid her love for Austen because “it wasn’t cool” now she says that everyone in the society draws off of each others’ confidence, and no one worries about what other people think. “If you’re walking around in a Regency dress in February people do think, ‘OK, you must be mad, it’s freezing’,” she says. “But generally it’s positive, people just think we’re celebrating something we all enjoy, having fun together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdea5de9aa8f9efda316d8eac4504dea6d00082/0_223_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f275a22dedc7d70357b4dc24b11bbd2","title":"volkswagen to stop making its iconic beetle in 2019","story":"Company to produce two special editions of famed model before ceasing productionVolkswagen will stop making the Beetle car next year, ending nearly seven decades of production in North America, the company has announced.The company’s American unit said it would halt output at its plant in Mexico after making two special edition models of the third-generation bulbous bug in July 2019.The compact Beetle was introduced in Germany in 1938 during the Nazi era and came to the US 11 years later, where it became a symbol of utilitarian transportation often used by hippies.The car attained further popularity with the 1968 Disney movie The Love Bug, the story of a racing Volkswagen with a mind of its own.Andy Warhol did prints featuring the car and a Beetle was also the most prominent car in the background of Abbey Road, the final Beatles album to be recorded.The car sold for about 30 years before production ceased in 1979.Volkswagen revived it in 1998 as a more modern “New Beetle”, attracting mainly female buyers. The company revamped it for the 2012 model year in an effort to make it appeal to men, giving it a flatter roof, less bulbous shape, a bigger trunk and a navigation system. US sales rose fivefold to nearly 29,000 in the first year, but tailed off after that.

Everything came directly from their promotional ision before their demise.The result was a treasure trove of Lehman Brothers items that Cam swears are the genuine article, including a laptop bag or a crystal paperweight, both on offer for $89.89.“Everything I sell is authentic Lehman Brothers memorabilia,” said Cam, adding: “I own the last of it.”The items may be rare but demand is slow enough that if you buy a Lehman Brothers baby bib – for the investment banker’s infant who has everything – he will throw in a black duffel bag for free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69415704967b201ada2f8578d185034c52d1cfe5/0_188_5128_3077/master/5128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfda5370dabdc26d9399f10b12a3e65","title":"amazon worker cage staff","story":"A cage for workers on wheels. It sounds like the stuff of science fiction. It’s not. In 2016, Amazon filed a patent for a device described as a “system and method for transporting personnel within an active workplace”. It is actually a cage large enough to fit a worker. It’s mounted on top of an automated trolley device. A robotic arm faces outwards.The worker cage was designed by Amazon’s robotic engineers. It was intended to protect workers in Amazon’s warehouses when they needed to venture into spaces where robot stock-pickers whizz around. Amazon’s worker cage was quietly patented and only came to global attention thanks to the diligent digging of two academics. When the workers’ cage started to appear in newspaper headlines, Amazon executives declared it a “bad idea”.Amazon may have dropped the plans, but that should not come as a surprise. The company doesn’t need a robotic cage for workers – it already has one of the most all-pervasive control systems in history. In its huge warehouses, workers carry hand-held computers that control their movements. A wristband patented by the company (but which is not yet in use) can direct the movement of workers’ hands using “haptic feedback”. Stock pickers in Amazon warehouses are watched by cameras, and workers have reportedly been reduced to urinating in bottles in order to hit their targets, and they are constantly reminded of their productivity rates. Investigations by journalists have also exposed a worryingly high level of ambulance call-outs to Amazon warehouses in the UK.Delivery drivers working on contract for the company are closely tracked and monitored by a system which sets extreme targets that workers must hit. In the US, Amazon drivers are suing, claiming that they often work many hours of unpaid overtime. The relentless targets have reportedly led to unsafe driving. Some say that to keep pace they were forced to defecate in bags which they kept in their delivery vans.Workers in Amazon’s headquarters also face unrelenting control. An investigation by the New York Times found that executives were expected to be constantly available by email. Office workers were monitored by their co-workers as well as their bosses, by means of a special system that allowed employees to anonymously assess any other employee. This feedback was taken into account when the company decided who could keep their job and who they would let go. The result was a workforce constantly attached to the firm. One employee spent her entire vacation in a Starbucks just so she could deal with demands constantly coming in from headquarters. Another employee says was told she was “a problem” after taking time off to look after her dying father, and was blocked from moving to a less pressured job.Amazon justifies this system of intense worker control on the basis that customers win. I recently sat through a fascinating seminar on the digital transformation of the economy. One panellist described how great it was that he could ask Alexa – Amazon’s virtual assistant – to order food for his dog and it would arrive the next day. While he (and his dog) may have been pleased with Alexa’s help, it ignores the fact that there are many others who are clearly harmed. There are the exhausted workers in warehouses, the speeding delivery drivers, the executives on the edge of a mental breakdown running the whole system.But there are also companies in Amazon’s supply chain that are completely reliant on it for business. This means Amazon is able to dictate the terms for these companies. There are the many thousands of companies, small and large, that have been driven out of business by Amazon. And the US government supports companies such as Amazon by giving some of their employees food stamps to top up meagre wages. But I think the satisfied dog owner is also potentially harmed by the fact that his entire home life can be tracked and listened into by a corporation whose capacity for conducting surveillance operations far surpasses anything that the Stasi would ever have dared to dream of.The problem with Amazon is not that it has considered patenting a wheeled cage for workers the real issue is the company’s increasingly tight grip on entire sectors of the economy. Consumers might benefit, but many others are losing out. For that reason, some are calling for a radical rethink of how “platform companies” such as Amazon are regulated.We would not just be asking whether they benefit their consumers who find it easier to order dog food. Instead, we would need to ask whether they benefit the broader public good. That would mean considering the impact they have on workers, suppliers, investors, competitors, national governments and much more. If we started to ask these questions, it is unlikely we would continue to see gigantic companies that dominate whole sectors of the economy as such a good idea.• André Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School in London, is the author of Business Bullshit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb5f7eadb3b2e487fccdfeefef6223525508509/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c06e96975107920e24498166b538184e","title":"jaguar land rover brexit cars birmingham manufacturing","story":"To come from the West Midlands and say you don’t like cars is tantamount to heresy, yet it’s precisely because I come from the West Midlands that I can’t stand the things. Nevertheless, it produced intensely mixed feelings to hear the car manufacturing giant Jaguar Land Rover – which directly and indirectly employs tens of thousands in the region – state that it can’t guarantee any of its UK jobs in the event of a hard Brexit.JLR, which employs tens of thousands of people at its plants in Castle Bromwich, Solihull, Gaydon (near Coventry) and south Staffordshire, has dominated much of my experience and perception of Birmingham since growing up there in the 1980s. Boys at school wanted to work at “the Rover”, as jobs there were well paid and skilled. As the Lode Lane plant, a few miles from my parents’ house, grew, it seemed to become a town in itself: knowing it was there, giving people decent work, felt like a bulwark against decades of manufacturing destruction and wage attrition in the region.When the vast MG Rover plant at Longbridge finally closed in 2005, with the direct loss of 6,300 jobs, more than 500 workers were out of work and had not received any retraining almost a year later. Three years after closure, research by Birmingham Business School found most former MG workers had seen their annual pay drop by almost £6,000.And yet. I can’t stand cars, though it’s not cars themselves that are the problem – or, in the main, the people who drive them – but what the late sociologist John Urry called “the system of automobility”: the roads, the speed, the insane inefficiency of producing one giant, dangerous, complex, environmentally disastrous mobility machine for every adult who can afford one.In capitulating to the car system in the 1950s and 1960s, Birmingham’s leaders, most notably its chief planner, Herbert Manzoni, tried to be the first to create a 21st-century city based on technology developed in the late 19th century. Cars are archaic, even if the methods used to produce them are increasingly high-tech.There has to be a better way. In 1976, threatened workers at Lucas Aerospace in Birmingham developed a detailed and visionary plan to save their jobs by proposing that the company transitioned from making products for military use to making socially useful products such as medical equipment, collective transport and energy conservation tools. Tellingly, the Lucas workers involved in the plan were opposed not only by the company’s managers, who refused even to present the proposals to the government – its biggest customer and its greatest potential investors – but by union leaders whose focus was on retaining jobs in the present rather than saving them for the future.There are echoes of this in the present day, as the Unite leader, Len McCluskey, comes out in favour of a third runway at Heathrow rather than demanding investment in more sustainable forms of travel – and, by definition, more sustainable jobs for his members.While inidual car ownership appears to have peaked, the total number of car journeys made annually has risen since the financial crash of 2008, caused in part by more pressurised lives, longer and more frequent commutes to work, and repeated cuts to bus services. People living on the peripheries of cities and in rural areas, though poorer and on average older, are increasingly forced towards car ownership and frequent taxi use.None of this is of direct concern to JLR’s bosses and its owner, Tata, whose primary concern is on maintaining high levels of export sales for its Liverpool-made Evoque model – a sort of mini-SUV for urban use, as though anyone actually needs a mini-SUV for urban use – and the Land Rover Discovery, made in Solihull – though production is to move to Slovakia – for sale mainly in China and America. Imagine if JLR were encouraged to make the same investment in high-quality, non-polluting, cheap-to-run buses, trams and trains.In the spirit of the Lucas Plan, the abundant skills of Birmingham car workers can’t be lost in the event of a catastrophe-level Brexit. It’s obvious now, in a time of political and social upheaval and environmental danger, that government has to play a direct role in encouraging companies to think about the products they produce – the effects they have, how they can be used to help save the world rather than destroy it – and to actively recruit their workers to do that thinking.This is not, in any way, to welcome JLR’s statement or to suggest that Brexit – as it seems to be heading – is a great idea that will automatically lead to companies making radical decisions that will benefit anyone other than their shareholders. JLR is simply trying to point out the obvious: that British manufacturing has been aggressively directed towards frictionless trade and supply, and that any degree of friction may cause the whole enterprise to seize up.But we shouldn’t be celebrating the fact that the Midlands’ main source of skilled manufacturing jobs, at least for now, is making cars. Another Birmingham is possible.• Lynsey Hanley is a freelance writer and the author of Estates: an Intimate History and Respectable: Crossing the Class Divide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e514edc1a3c673fbadd0edcc69c5d6d393c51c2/0_253_4668_2800/master/4668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98c03404fc55d89bcff3f19b8b247d8e","title":"women 40s freeze eggs single women fertility options","story":"That conclusion is unsurprising, echoing a chorus of warnings about age-related decline in women’s fertility. But it also strikes me as over-simplistic, and out of touch with the circumstances in which real women find themselves.Over the past two years, as part of my research into single women’s fertility options, I have met hundreds of women who are considering freezing their eggs, and spoken to them in detail about their thoughts, feelings and decision-making processes. Some of these women are indeed in their early thirties and are thinking proactively about their future and fertility. Not yet ready for motherhood, but keenly aware of their declining fertility, and often having witnessed friends who have struggled with trying to conceive, they choose to freeze their eggs now to give themselves the best possible chance of conception when the time is right for them to have a baby. They may well conceive naturally in the future and never need to use their frozen eggs, but nevertheless see the hefty price tag as an investment that will alleviate their reproductive anxieties. These women will be reassured by the HFEA’s advice to freeze eggs early. But they are the lucky ones, and they are in the minority.In addition to these complicated social realities, the 10-year limit for storing frozen eggs, as the report acknowledges, is another consideration for women thinking about freezing their eggs. The current law means that younger women who freeze their eggs will not necessarily extend their options beyond their natural fertility , and may have to discard their eggs before they are ready to use them. This clearly poses a paradox between the clinically and socially optimum time to freeze eggs, and experts are currently campaigning to extend the storage limit. Indeed, in a House of Lords debate on Thursday, Baroness Deech noted that the 10-year rule for eggs is discriminatory since sperm can be frozen for up to 55 years, and added that it would be a pity to tell women approaching the end of their storage limit: “Do not wait for Mr Right Mr Average will have to do.” She is right to argue that 10 years is an arbitrary limit that may not give women sufficient time, especially if they have frozen their eggs early. But I also worry that an extension could open the floodgates to ever-younger women being targeted by egg-freezing companies, as is the case in the United States. While egg freezing is often discussed in terms of fertility empowerment, it is important to note who stands to profit from women’s growing reproductive anxieties.The HFEA’s desire to avoid older women from being potentially exploited by being charged large sums of money to freeze their eggs with unrealistic expectations is absolutely understandable. But this has to be accompanied by a corresponding awareness of the ethical problems associated with encouraging younger women to undergo an expensive, private medical procedure to freeze their eggs, when most will never need to use them.The new report will undoubtedly provide some clarity and transparency to women considering freezing their eggs. But as a society we need to look at the deeper structural and relational reasons why women are delaying childbearing, and address these not just through fertility awareness campaigns but also through concrete changes to working and childcare practices. In the meantime, we need regulators to engage much more fully with questions around the growing commercialisation of egg freezing – and its ethical implications.• Zeynep Gurtin is a sociologist and visiting researcher at the Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be3cb80e397409bddd3024f247c25e967d0c9d3/0_32_2894_1736/master/2894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c729c1ec37c9088faeb3f2082b5f923e","title":"bernie sanders international progressive front","story":"Demagogues who exploit people’s fears are rising around the world. For an effective opposition, we can’t rely on the status quoThere is a global struggle taking place of enormous consequence. Nothing less than the future of the planet – economically, socially and environmentally – is at stake.While these regimes may differ in some respects, they share key attributes: hostility toward democratic norms, antagonism toward a free press, intolerance toward ethnic and religious minorities, and a belief that government should benefit their own selfish financial interests. These leaders are also deeply connected to a network of multi-billionaire oligarchs who see the world as their economic plaything.Those of us who believe in democracy, who believe that a government must be accountable to its people, must understand the scope of this challenge if we are to effectively confront it.It should be clear by now that Donald Trump and the rightwing movement that supports him is not a phenomenon unique to the United States. All around the world, in Europe, in Russia, in the Middle East, in Asia and elsewhere we are seeing movements led by demagogues who exploit people’s fears, prejudices and grievances to achieve and hold on to power.This trend certainly did not begin with Trump, but there’s no question that authoritarian leaders around the world have drawn inspiration from the fact that the leader of the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy seems to delight in shattering democratic norms.Three years ago, who would have imagined that the United States would stay neutral between Canada, our democratic neighbor and second largest trading partner, and Saudi Arabia, a monarchic, client state that treats women as third-class citizens? It’s also hard to imagine that Israel’s Netanyahu government would have moved to pass the recent “nation state law”, which essentially codifies the second-class status of Israel’s non-Jewish citizens, if Benjamin Netanyahu didn’t know Trump would have his back.All of this is not exactly a secret. As the US continues to grow further and further apart from our longtime democratic allies, the US ambassador to Germany recently made clear the Trump administration’s support for rightwing extremist parties across Europe.In addition to Trump’s hostility toward democratic institutions we have a billionaire president who, in an unprecedented way, has blatantly embedded his own economic interests and those of his cronies into the policies of government.Other authoritarian states are much farther along this kleptocratic process. In Russia, it is impossible to tell where the decisions of government end and the interests of Vladimir Putin and his circle of oligarchs begin. They operate as one unit. Similarly, in Saudi Arabia, there is no debate about separation because the natural resources of the state, valued at trillions of dollars, belong to the Saudi royal family. In Hungary, far-right authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán is openly allied with Putin in Russia. In China, an inner circle led by Xi Jinping has steadily consolidated power, clamping down on domestic political freedom while it aggressively promotes a version of authoritarian capitalism abroad.We must understand that these authoritarians are part of a common front. They are in close contact with each other, share tactics and, as in the case of European and American rightwing movements, even share some of the same funders. The Mercer family, for example, supporters of the infamous Cambridge Analytica, have been key backers of Trump and of Breitbart News, which operates in Europe, the United States and Israel to advance the same anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim agenda. Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson gives generously to rightwing causes in both the United States and Israel, promoting a shared agenda of intolerance and illiberalism in both countries.The truth is, however, that to effectively oppose rightwing authoritarianism, we cannot simply go back to the failed status quo of the last several decades. Today in the United States, and in many other parts of the world, people are working longer hours for stagnating wages, and worry that their children will have a lower standard of living than they do.Together governments of the world must come together to end the absurdity of the rich and multinational corporations stashing over $21tn in offshore bank accounts to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and then demanding that their respective governments impose an austerity agenda on their working families.It is not acceptable that the fossil fuel industry continues to make huge profits while their carbon emissions destroy the planet for our children and grandchildren.It is not acceptable that a handful of multinational media giants, owned by a small number of billionaires, largely control the flow of information on the planet.It is not acceptable that trade policies that benefit large multinational corporations and encourage a race to the bottom hurt working people throughout the world as they are written out of public view.It is not acceptable that, with the cold war long behind us, countries around the world spend over $1tn a year on weapons of destruction, while millions of children die of easily treatable diseases.In order to effectively combat the rise of the international authoritarian axis, we need an international progressive movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people, and that addresses the massive global inequality that exists, not only in wealth but in political power.Such a movement must be willing to think creatively and boldly about the world that we would like to see. While the authoritarian axis is committed to tearing down a post-second world war global order that they see as limiting their access to power and wealth, it is not enough for us to simply defend that order as it exists now.We must look honestly at how that order has failed to deliver on many of its promises, and how authoritarians have adeptly exploited those failures in order to build support for their agenda. We must take the opportunity to reconceptualize a genuinely progressive global order based on human solidarity, an order that recognizes that every person on this planet shares a common humanity, that we all want our children to grow up healthy, to have a good education, have decent jobs, drink clean water, breathe clean air and live in peace.Our job is to reach out to those in every corner of the world who share these values, and who are fighting for a better world.In a time of exploding wealth and technology, we have the potential to create a decent life for all people. Our job is to build on our common humanity and do everything that we can to oppose all of the forces, whether unaccountable government power or unaccountable corporate power, who try to ide us up and set us against each other. We know that those forces work together across borders. We must do the same.Bernie Sanders is a US Senator from VermontBernie Sanders is spot-on. Financiers have long formed an international “brotherhood” to guarantee themselves international bailouts when their paper pyramids crash.More recently, xenophobic rightwing zealots also formed their very own Nationalist International, turning once proud people against another so that they control their wealth and politics.It is high time that Democrats from across the world form a Progressive International in the interests of a majority of people on every continent, in every country.Sanders is also right when he says that the solution is not to go back to a status quo whose spectacular failure has paved the ground for the rise of the Nationalist International.Our Progressive International must lead with a vision of the green, shared prosperity that human ingenuity is capable of providing – as long as democracy is given a chance to enable it.To that end we need to do more than campaign together. Let us form a common council that draws out a common blueprint for an International New Deal, a progressive New Bretton Woods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe0f71e705ed1258fed6c5b03852ce24e96ccae4/0_15_2835_1702/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6665b686b63550106150e901cf1179ba","title":"modern toss","story":"Modern Toss on heritage rock bands Gavin Haynes on indie musicians’ quest for second income"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc7c3890f6703ec7e98d0279552cbf7f2dadc455/0_234_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f91e0718f8d22bc7240f7b4a961dbc0","title":"record numbers expected for annual british beach clean","story":"Thousands of volunteers will help remove plastic and other litter from beaches this weekendRecord numbers of volunteers are anticipated this weekend to help clear litter from the UK’s beaches, in the 25th annual Great British Beach Clean organised by a leading marine charity.In 2017, 6,944 volunteers attended beach cleans at 339 locations all over the UK from the north of Scotland to Cornwall, Northern Ireland to the Channel Islands. This year, before any litter has been picked, 7,391 volunteers have pre-registered at 432 coastal spots.Much of the waste was plastic, prompting the MCS to call on the government to urgently introduce a charge on single-use plastic items, such as straws, cups and cutlery.More unusual items retrieved in previous years include an artificial Christmas tree, socks, pants and bras, dentures, half a canoe, a French bullet proof vest, and half a TV set.Lizzie Prior, MCS beach and river clean-up project officer, said previous years’ experience showed that numbers registered pre-event could triple over the weekend itself. “Last year, by this time, a couple of thousand volunteers had registered, but our final figures were just short of 7,000. Since then, we’ve seen the BBC’s Blue Planet II effect, so that more and more people have been keen to clean beaches at our many events throughout the year.

If you are in a shop, you may have to deal with your knicker-clad image in an unfamiliar mirror, as well as the tediously loaded issue of whether the size you have picked out accommodates your waistline. So much easier to buy a pair of earrings or a new\u0026nbspsweater, which you can try for size without\u0026nbsphaving to strip off.I get it. Except, the easy option is not even halfway effective. If you want to fundamentally update your outfit, you need a root and branch overhaul, because the wardrobe centre of gravity right now is a midi-length dress.A few years ago, you got yourself a\u0026nbsppair of flattering black trousers and you knew that they were the base of any number of\u0026nbspeffective, on-point, smart daytime outfits.

Handily, this seems to be the length most hemlines billed as midi-length actually are, on me, because clothes are still – mystifyingly – cut for a woman who is about 8cm (3in) taller than average. (I get that it is easier to shorten a skirt than lengthen it, but still.) Over the past few years, it is quite possible that you have found three versions of this type of dress that work for you and that getting dressed essentially involves rotating them depending on colour, mood and what is in the wash. If this is the case, go you. But if you have been ignoring this look and hoping it was going to go away, then now is a good time to face the fact that\u0026nbspit is not. If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.This is such an easy style to wear at this time of\u0026nbspyear. It bares the perfect amount of ankle, which is to say enough to remind the world that you have legs, but not so much that you have to think about what your legs look like. The longer hemline can be challenging with a proper coat, but it works neatly with a waist-length jacket or a blazer. There is nothing stopping you from wearing this dress.

But that’s changed…Jesse Eisenberg has a reputation for not suffering fools, for witheringly knocking down any stupid questions that are put to him. In the 12 years since his breakout role as a callow, Kafka-referencing teen in Noah Baumbach’s The Squid and the Whale, he has made his name with characters who are – or at least believe they are – the smartest person in the room: the snarky theme-park attendant in Adventureland the college kid bon-moting his way through the apocalypse in Zombieland and, of course, his sociopathically still performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for which he received an Oscar nomination for best actor.In person, speaking at the Toronto international film festival, the 34-year-old is disarmingly alert – quick to answer a question with a question – but never difficult or obtuse. There is a fine seam of comic self-doubt running through his patter and today he is mostly just buzzing with ideas. He is fascinated and appalled by the high-speed, high-frequency trading depicted in his upcoming film The Hummingbird Project – where computer algorithms buy and sell stocks in the blink of an eye – but can relate to people such as his character Vincent, “so caught up in the pursuit that they lose any sight of any kind of ethical considerations”.“It’s like when you’re acting in a movie and there’s a tree in the middle of the shot,” he says. “The first thought of every person on a crew is: ‘We’ll just cut down the tree,’ rather than move the camera. Because when you’re working on a movie you think that the world needs to see this story, that it’s so important, and of course the tree is irrelevant in the grand scheme of that. Only when the day is over and you look back at it do you think: ‘Well, I really don’t think we needed to cut down the tree to do this horror-comedy …’”If Eisenberg can see the forest for the trees when it comes to Hollywood, it is probably because acting is not the only thing he does. He has written a number of plays, as well as humour pieces and short stories for the New Yorker and McSweeney’s. Most significantly, he has recently become a father for the first time. He and his wife had a son last year, a development that has put his day job into perspective.“I don’t think I care any less about my work, or like it any less – in some ways, I like it more, because it’s my one opportunity to get away for a few minutes!” he says. “But I do think if humans have the unconscious desire at all to be immortal, maybe that feeling of immortality is being accounted for in another way through their children, rather than through their work, so maybe it takes the pressure off that.”Having a child has been instructive, not least in terms of the feelings of anxiety that have been a constant in Eisenberg’s life since childhood. He has spoken about being diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety and depression last year, he recorded a video in which he offered advice to his younger self on overcoming anxiety.“Just selfishly, having a child is the best thing anyone can do for their own anxiety, if your anxiety is like mine, which is to say based in fantasy,” he says. “Because I spent the first 30 years worrying about things that were invisible, and now I get to worry about something that’s visible, and there’s nothing that’s more mentally healthy than worrying about something that’s actually existing in the world, rather than worrying about something that doesn’t exist at all.”One of the films for which Eisenberg is best known is Woody Allen’s To Rome With Love, in which he played the central role that Allen might once have played himself he also starred in the director’s film Café Society and has spoken about the way Allen has inspired him creatively. I wonder, then, how he has processed an allegation of sexual abuse made against Allen by his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, which she claims took place when she was seven years old and which has been back in the headlines again this year. (Allen has always maintained his innocence the claims were investigated at the time and no charges were brought.)“As for Woody Allen, I was 16 years old when I discovered him,” he says. “I’ve read everything he’s written, I’ve watched everything he’s made. He’s changed my life more than any other creative inspiration. And so when I read about something like this, it’s upsetting to me and I don’t know what to think, because it exists in a greyer area than a lot of the other allegations. So I don’t want to say anything specific about that, but I’ll just say that those two things are on my mind, my extra-curricular work and also honouring somebody’s feelings who has been hurt.” He smiles nervously. “Was that OK?”In The Hummingbird Project, the role Eisenberg would normally be expected to take – awkward genius – is filled instead by the Swedish hunk Alexander Skarsgård, who plays Anton, a tech savant with game-changing ideas and a tendency towards introverted awkwardness. (Skarsgård is virtually unrecognisable in a bald cap and a prosthetic pot belly.) Eisenberg plays Anton’s striver cousin, the man who facilitates his genius.Together, the pair devise an ambitious plan to lay a fibre-optic cable from Kansas to New Jersey, under rivers, mountains and millions of homes. The aim of this quixotic endeavour is to receive stock-market information one millisecond faster than the high-frequency traders on Wall Street, a tiny advantage that could net Vincent, Anton and their clients hundreds of millions of dollars.The Canadian director Kim Nguyen films all this as a high-stakes caper: the pair race against time to get their cable operational and face a formidable, power-suited rival in Hayek’s stock-exchange boss. Anton is the brains of the operation, with Vincent providing the unrelenting drive and gift of the gab.Nguyen sent Eisenberg the roles of Anton and Vincent and he opted for the one that seemed most out of character. “I just knew I didn’t want to play the socially aloof genius, because I’d done that, and also because I liked Vincent more,” he says. “The only thought I had was to play the dumber hustler.”Despite the attempt to play against type, early reviews of The Hummingbird Project have noted that Vincent has an inherent Eisenbergness: the pointed staccato delivery, the restless physicality and the sardonic worldview we have come to expect in his performances. That seems a touch unfair. Vincent, for reasons that become apparent in the film, is a more heroic and poignant figure than Eisenberg’s previous creations, but by now it is a characterisation with which the actor has become familiar – and even comfortable.“You just want to keep things interesting for yourself by playing characters that seem different, but you can’t control how an audience perceives you,” he sayswith a shrug. “As long as I get to do things I like, I don’t really care.”Sometimes Eisenberg cares a little too much. In 2015, he wrote a New Yorker short story entitled An Honest Film Review. Written from the perspective of a middling, snarky critic who takes marks off the film he is reviewing because the press screening is on the other side of town, the piece was intended as a lighthearted dig at “the one guy who doesn’t take his job seriously and only reviews movies in so far as it affects him or her personally”, Eisenberg says. It did not go down that way – it was seen as an attack on film criticism in general. Critics hit back at him on Twitter and in articles. The reaction horrified him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8674168a21d158d10b734509fef4a283818d8460/0_364_8510_5107/master/8510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1827fc7f93512dc7f1d4b650d6b6373f","title":"anna jones recipes french vegetable barigoule pistou","story":"A herby, lemony provençal vegetable broth, to serve with pesto’s cleaner, greener, fresher cousinSometime in the early 90s, my family took a day trip to France. My dad had heard about a restaurant near the ferry and we went for a lunch that changed how I look at food. I was so impressed by the deep respect given to food, to cooking and serving – and the seriousness of it all. It wasn’t the style I now cook in – I’ve never quite found the patience to cook like those chefs – but I am forever grateful to my father for booking that table.Barigoule is a provençal style of cooking vegetables in broth, usually artichokes. Here I’ve used late-summer veg, crisped garlic cloves – and a hint of vanilla, which brings a subtle warmth balanced by heady peppercorns, lemony coriander seeds and thyme. I’ve used frozen peas and bulbous salad onions (rather than the thinner spring onions), but if you are making this earlier in the season and fresh peas are around, they are the gold standard. I often finish this with a little of the pistou to the left.8 baby carrots with green tops, peeledSalt and black pepper½ tsp coriander seeds3 tbsp olive oil10 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed4 salad or spring onions, halved 8 bulbs baby fennel, trimmed and halved, or 2 medium heads of fennel, cut into eighths1.5 litres vegetable stock10 sprigs thyme5 whole black peppercorns1 bay leaf1 vanilla pod, split lengthways3 tbsp sherry vinegar2 handfuls fresh or frozen peas (about 100g)150g sugar snap peas, halved lengthways1 small bunch parsley andor chervilBoil the carrots in a pan of salted water until still crisp but tender – two to three minutes. Scoop them out and put into a large bowl to cool(I don’t use iced water, because I think it removes a lot of flavour).Pour out the water and dry the pan. Next, toast the coriander seeds over medium-high heat until fragrant – one to two minutes. Add two tablespoons of oil and cook the garlic until golden – anotherthree to four minutes – then, using a slotted spoon, scoop all this into the bowl with the carrots.Cook the salad onions and fennel until just golden – eight to 10 minutes – then add to the bowl with the garlic and carrots.Next, put the stock, thyme, peppercorns, bay leaf and vanilla pod into the pan, and simmer until reduced by half – about 30 minutes. Strain the stock and put it back into the pan. Whisk in the vinegar and the rest of the oil, season, then put back over a medium heat. Stir in all the veg from the bowl, add the peas and sugar snaps, and cook, covered, until the vegetables are heated through– two to three minutes. Divide the veg between bowls and ladle the broth over the top garnish with a few sprigs of herbs, a sprinkling of sea salt and some pistou (see below), if you like.This is pesto’s less-famous cousin, traditionally without pine nuts or parmesan, and I think all the better for it: cleaner, greener, fresher. I use this pistou to finish soups and stews, for dunking bread, and for stirring into mayonnaise to dip crudites in. I like to make this with a pestle and mortar, because the end result is creamier – the bashing of the basil also brings out the flavour better – but if you are short on time, a food processor will do.1 garlic clove, peeled and the green germ removed1 good pinch salt2 bunches basil leaves (about 50g)125ml extra-virgin olive oilA splash of lemon juice (optional)With a pestle and mortar, bash the garlic with a pinch of salt until creamy. Add the basil leaves – you may want to break them apart first – and crush them into the garlic until you have a paste.Drizzle in the oil a tablespoon at a time, until the pistou reaches a smooth, sauce-like consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning. You may want to add a splash of lemon juice or a pinch more salt you may also want to thin the pistou with a bit more olive oil.If you are using a food processor, pulse the garlic, salt and basila few times until the basil leaves begin to break down. With the machine running, drizzle in the oil a tablespoon at a time, until the pistou reaches a smooth, sauce-like consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning as above."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc60b5cca4b87ff8b3948975fa5793023b0a02f/521_126_1043_626/master/1043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35bf345a926315cf1b619d79fc507c15","title":"jose mourinho marcus rashford statistics defends manchester united pundits obsessed lies","story":"• Manchester United manager unhappy at claims over Rashford • Accuses pundits of being ‘obsessed’ with him and telling ‘lies’José Mourinho has defended his use of Marcus Rashford, with Manchester United’s manager reading from a prepared sheet of statistics regarding the forward’s appearances since he took over in summer 2016.Rashford scored two in two games for England during the international break but it was suggested by some pundits that the 20-year-old may have to leave United to further his development. Rashford is unavailable for Saturday’s game at Watford because he starts a three-game suspension“But it is not my fault, he’s suspended, so probably you should remind them that he is suspended and cannot play. Performances with England, of course I’m happy, he played well, he competed well, he scored and especially in a period where he comes with some sadness after his suspension it was very good that he did that.”Mourinho then read from the sheet. “On the season 16-17 Marcus Rashford played 32 Premier League matches, 11 Europa League matches, including the final, three FA Cup matches, six League Cup matches including the final and the Community Shield. He had 53 appearances but if you want to take to the minutes of play, he played 3,068 and if you want to ide that by 90 minutes of the matches, he played 34.2 matches of 90 minutes.“In 17-18, he played 35 Premier League matches, eight in Champions League, five in FA Cup including the final, three League Cup matches and the European Super Cup final. He played a total of 52 matches with 2,676 minutes, if you ide that by 90, it gives 29.7 matches, so with me, in two seasons, he had 105 appearances, 5,744 minutes, 63.7 matches of 90 minutes, including five finals, so the people that is speaking about these minutes, I think they are a bit confused.”Mourinho pointed to young players at Liverpool, Chelsea and Everton as a comparison. “Marcus Rashford is not Dominic Solanke, not Ruben Loftus-Cheek, not Dominic Calvert-Lewin,” he said. “He is Marcus Rashford, Manchester United player, with an incredible number of appearances and an incredible number of minutes played at the highest level in the best possible competitions.”Mourinho also joked about falling over a barrier last Saturday at Wembley, where he watched England’s defeat by Spain. “I protect my phones, it was a good e, no penalty,” he said. “No yellow card.”Marouane Fellaini is a doubt for the Watford game, with Mourinho also suggesting Ander Herrera may be ruled out because of an ankle problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e3fac58e0c7602c25d8085eaf2cd8ae1b7d347c/426_825_4888_2932/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4734dccc1e4bbd445274ebe6732b3dff","title":"nwankwo kanu we have saved 542 arsenal","story":"Nwankwo Kanu remembers the shouting, the confusion and the overriding sense of desperation. A woman had brought her gravely ill daughter to him, feeling she had nowhere else to turn, and now she was begging him to save the child’s life. Then the little girl collapsed. “We had to pick her up and run to the hospital,” Kanu says. “Thank God she didn’t die.”It was the year 2000 and Kanu had just set up his eponymous heart foundation, having undergone a life‑or-death scare himself in 1996. The girl’s mother had read the publicity and tracked the footballer to the Nigeria team hotel, where the squad were preparing for an Africa Cup of Nations game.“The mum wanted to show me the girl for me to help,” Kanu says. “When she saw me at the hotel, she was shouting and suddenly the girl fainted. Later on at the hospital I promised the mum that the first kid we were going to operate on would be her daughter.”The girl’s name was Eniton and she was among the first children that the Kanu Heart Foundation took from Nigeria to London for surgery at Great Ormond Street hospital.“For a little girl of that age – not playing, no energy in her, not moving around she doesn’t smile, the eyes are blue. They are really suffering, in a really bad situation, and you ask yourself: ‘If nobody comes in to help and they die …’“But after all of the children had their operations, I went to visit them and they were full of smiles, jumping and playing with me, rolling around with me and when you looked at the mums, you saw the happiness. From that day, I said: ‘This is something that we have to do more and do more.’”There is a beautiful update to Eniton’s story – she is about to graduate from Lagos State university, where Kanu has helped to pay her fees. But the foundation has saved the lives of many more children from underprivileged backgrounds in Africa and Kanu is proud to reveal the precise figure.“We have saved 542,” he says. “But we keep doing it. This week four patients went to Sudan and we’re hearing that the operations were successful and another six are about to leave as well.“We have partnered with hospitals, we do check-ups, we talk to the parents, we educate them and at the same time we take the kids to other countries for operations. The goal of the foundation is to build our own cardiac hospitals in Africa, starting in Nigeria. It would make it all much easier. As a footballer you win trophies and it’s good. But this is so much more.”Kanu has always been a guy to stand out and he does not go unnoticed in Hertfordshire, where he lives with his wife and three children. He jokes that he intended to kick back and relax on his retirement as a player in 2012 – “I thought: ‘OK, it’s holiday time,’” he says – but he is too philanthropic, too driven to make a difference, for that.The 42-year-old is an ambassador for the Nigeria Football Federation and he also works for Fifa as an ambassador. “I am called a legend and people see me as one but because of that I don’t think I should have to hide at home and only go on holidays, drink champagne and watch TV,” Kanu says. “I am somebody that wants to impact on to people’s lives.”Kanu’s labour of love remains his foundation and with more time on his hands, he has been able to give more of himself to the raising of funds and awareness. His latest initiative is a charity match to be played at Barnet’s Hive stadium on Saturday 30 September between African and Premier League players. A host of big-name ex-professionals have signed up, including Jay-Jay Okocha, Sol Campbell, Teddy Sheringham and Robert Pires.Kanu was shaped by his tough upbringing in Imo state, where money was tight and barefoot street football the norm. He does not forget his roots and after he joined Ajax from Iwuanyanwu Nationale, he says his “first priority was to help those back home that didn’t have anything”.He adds: “I am a sportsman so what do you do? You try to advise other young ones that are coming through. You take boots and jerseys back home. You create an academy. You help them with their school fees.”Kanu’s outlook would only harden during a hellish month that followed his move from Ajax to Internazionale and, when he retells the tale, it is heavy on remarkable detail. For some reason he had played in two pre-season friendlies for the Italian club before he took his medical but when he did, he was immediately stood down from the next one. No one told him why and he was in the dark until the following morning. That was when he switched on the TV.“What they reported was that I had an issue with my heart and couldn’t play football any more,” Kanu says. “It was in the national papers in Italy as well. That’s how I found out – through the news. Later on, Inter came to tell me that, yeah, this was the situation. I said: ‘I have already heard about it.’ It was a big one – and for it to be revealed in such a manner. It should not have been like that. At that moment, everything was upside down for me.”Kanu was lucky that the problem with the aortic valve showed up at the medical and he owed the continuation of his career to a specialist in Cleveland, Ohio. He had been advised by doctors in the United Kingdom and Netherlands that he ought not to play on but the one in Cleveland was able to perform an operation to correct the damage and allow him to do so.Kanu had won three Ereisie titles at Ajax, together with the Champions League, and he helped Nigeria to Olympic gold in the summer of 1996. He would win the Uefa Cup at Inter before his move to Arsenal, where he won two Premier Leagues and two FA Cups. He would win another FA Cup at Portsmouth in 2008, scoring the only goal in the final. Capped 86 times by Nigeria, he played for them at three World Cups and was twice named African player of the year.“What I went through after my transfer to Inter made me stronger,” Kanu says. “There is no bigger test than when you are in between life and death so, if you can come up from there, you can handle anything. It gave me that push to go out and do whatever I had to do.“It also changed how I saw the world. For example, if you haven’t been in a hospital, you don’t really understand what is going on in there. I realised there was more to life than only to be comfortable on your own. You can open up to help others. I know the pain that I went through as an adult, so imagine how it is for kids. It’s difficult for them to take that pain.”Kanu needed a second operation in 2014 to re-repair the same valve and it left him feeling extremely weak. But it is impossible to keep him down for too long and he is more determined than ever to shine a light on the issues that relate to heart health, including those within professional football.“We’ve had people like Marc Vivien-Foé die while playing,” Kanu says. “There have been too many others, including Cheick Tioté. The clubs and the federations have to be serious about giving check-ups to the players. What is to stop them doing them every three months? It is something I have been pushing and preaching because who knows, I might have been one of those who played football and died if my issue had not been found during my medical at Inter.”The Petrolex Kanu Cup 2018 in association with Masters Football TM takes place on Saturday 30 September at the Hive stadium to raise funds for the Kanu Heart Foundation.\u0026nbspTo buy tickets, click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b33852e0611a3f0d2cbd72a8a6defc5ee27d84a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09663ca33a7d7a2933ac7e4e2d3d5338","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Spurs’ rough month could be extended by Liverpool, another perfect record is on the line at Watford and fears for West HamSeptember hasn’t exactly been great for Tottenham thus far. Defeat at Watford was followed by landing in Barcelona’s Champions League group, Daniel Levy confirming more costly delays to the new stadium and a night in Milton Keynes. Dele Alli got injured on international duty and their captain, Hugo Lloris, was ruled out with a thigh problem shortly after admitting being two times over the drink-drive limit. Ever a man to brighten the mood, Son Heung-min returns this week fresh from pulling the nutmeg of the year, with Asian Games gold (and military service exemption) also in the bag. How Spurs need him at lunchtime on Saturday against Liverpool. For all their talents, Tottenham are not otherwise blessed with pace and despite the South Korean playing eight games in four weeks, he should be called upon by Mauricio Pochettino, who is likely to employ the same counterattacking tactics that led to a 4-1 Spurs win in the same fixture last season. MBThe encouraging part for Chelsea is how they have adjusted to life under a manager who only arrived in west London in July. But while talk of a title challenge does not feel so fanciful after four consecutive league wins, Maurizio Sarri is unlikely to fall into the trap of thinking that his new team are the finished article. “We can improve,” Sarri said after the recent 2-0 victory over Bournemouth, and it will be interesting to see if he hands Olivier Giroud his first start of the season when Cardiff City visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The France striker scored a stunner against the Netherlands during the international break and he impressed against Bournemouth after replacing Álvaro Morata. Indeed, Giroud for Morata has been Chelsea’s first change in both of their previous two matches, which suggests some fine-tuning is required up front. JSIn recent weeks Leroy Sané has been dropped by Pep Guardiola, had his attitude criticised by Toni Kroos and become a father. Sané is used to dodging opponents at lightning speed but even he has struggled with all the obstacles in his way after his stunning campaign last season. Guardiola will hope the impact of becoming a dad might help settle the Germany international, who is yet to start a game for City this season and was left out of the squad entirely for the win over Newcastle. With their Champions League campaign starting against Lyon on Wednesday, Guardiola knows he will need to instigate the squad rotation process and having Sané in optimal mood can only be a good thing for the winger and the team, with Saturday the perfect time to reignite the engine. WUAfter opting for extreme caution during his side’s defeats to Manchester City and Chelsea, there is pressure on Rafa Benítez to let Newcastle play with more freedom. There is no guarantee of the Spaniard loosening up, though. He is still unhappy with Newcastle’s transfer business during the summer and responded to criticism of his tactics by rightly arguing that he had to cut his cloth accordingly against teams as strong as City and Chelsea. All the same, there seems little need for Newcastle to remain in ultra-defensive mode when they host Arsenal on Saturday. Arsenal are frail at the back and Benítez should not forget that his side won this fixture last season. JSAdama Traoré has always been regarded as a rough diamond, lightning quick but perhaps lacking composure or an end product. Yet since his £18m summer move to Wolves from Boro, with each of his three league appearances coming from the bench, he has hugely impressed. Per 90 minutes, nobody in the Premier League has created more chances than the 22-year-old or completed even half the number of successful dribbles: Eden Hazard has 5.56 to Traoré’s 11.87. Nuno Espírito Santo has so far refrained from starting Traoré in the league, such is his ability off the bench to stretch the game and punish tired legs, just as he did at West Ham in bursting past Aaron Cresswell to score a late winner. Nuno will be pondering whether to use Traoré as a second-half weapon or start him at home to Burnley on Sunday. In a game Wolves are expected to win, this could be the perfect opportunity for the latter. MBAfter losing their first four matches, West Ham could have done without a trip to one of their least favourite grounds. They rarely fare well at Goodison Park and Manuel Pellegrini will wince when he hears that Everton have won more Premier League matches (24) and scored more goals (80) against West Ham than they have against any other team. But the Premier League’s bottom side cannot lean on those grim statistics. They have to start somewhere and Pellegrini could remove some of the growing pressure by giving a recall to Declan Rice. The 19-year-old has not featured since being hauled off during the 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on the opening weekend, but West Ham need more solidity in midfield. JSProfligacy cost Bournemouth dearly in their defeat at Chelsea before the international break but their fans still have every reason to be cheerful. Eddie Howe reportedly has his pen poised over a lucrative new deal that will double his income – with a whacking great compensation clause should he be headhunted. Rather curiously, Howe has restricted midfielder Lewis Cook to just three substitute appearances in the league this season – two of them late in a bid to run out the clock. The England Under-21s captain currently finds himself behind Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman in the pecking order, despite some bravura performances which earned him a standby call for England’s World Cup squad. Cook recently signed a new four-year deal, so has probably received assurances from Howe, but his manager’s sparing use of him in the early stages of this season remains a mite puzzling. BGStill looking for their first win of the season, Huddersfield entertain a Crystal Palace team that have lost three consecutive Premier League matches since beating Fulham on the opening day. With five goals between them across eight games, toothlessness up front is a clearly a problem, particularly for Huddersfield. David Wagner’s team have failed to score in 23 of the 42 Premier League games they have played since he led them to promotion. Following their most recent outing, a battling 1-1 draw at Everton, Wagner expressed satisfaction with his side’s “effort, performance and attitude”, but bemoaned the paucity of scoring opportunities they created. Palace’s risible league record without Wilfried Zaha in the side has been well documented, but he could return after recovering from a groin injury. For different reasons, both sets of fans will be anticipating the release of the lineups even more keenly than the kick-off that follows an hour later. BGWith Jamie Vardy’s retirement from international football highlighting England’s lack of depth in attack, the stage is set for Danny Ings to remind Gareth Southgate of his qualities. The striker has caught the eye after joining Southampton on loan, scoring two goals in his past three games, and he will be difficult for Southgate to ignore if he maintains his fine form. Injuries stopped Ings from fulfilling his potential at Liverpool and the 26-year-old’s first task is to stay fit, but he proved he can flourish in the Premier League during his time at Burnley.

This is what he had to say about the idea:Hello, Simon here, back at the helm. I arrive with further news about Kevin de Bruyne’s release clause. The news is that it doesn’t exist after all. Here is Pep Guardiola’s reaction to the story: “I don’t know anything about that,” the Manchester City manager said. “The journalist asked me if we would sell for 250m and I said no. I don’t think he has a release clause in his contract.” Tim Howard, the former Manchester United goalkeeper, is part of a consortium that has acquired ... Dagenham \u0026amp Redbridge. The National League club, managed by Peter Taylor, have been taken over by Victoria Road Football, LLC, an American entity. These days, the USA international plays his football for Colorado Rapids. Talking of Taylor, here’s an interview with the former England manager himself:Who’s looking forward to Huddersfield v Crystal Palace? David Wagner’s men are winless this season, while Wilfried Zaha remains a doubt for Roy Hodgson’s side: Maurizio Sarri has a good old-fashioned selection headache, admitting it is difficult to accommodate Ethan Ampadu and Ruben Loftus-Cheek into his first-team lineup. The former, who impressed for Wales over the international break, is a January transfer target for Neil Warnock and Cardiff City, who travel to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Before beautifully referring to Loftus-Cheek as “Loftus”, Sarri said: “At the moment for me is not easy to give space to everyone. I have 28 players but I hope in the future I will be able to give him space, to give a space to Loftus. They are very young, they are for sure the future of the club. In this moment, it is important not to change the defensive line. In the first period, it’s very difficult to change the defensive line.” Listen to Jürgen Klopp v Gary Neville:Up in Kilmarnock, Steve Clarke has had a moan at the Scottish Football Association – for misspelling his name. Clarke was referred to as Steven, rather than Stephen, on a disciplinary charge sheet. “Maybe I’m being a little bit pedantic, but I thought it was disrespectful that they spelt my name wrong, both on the front cover and inside,” he huffed. “I won’t use the word amateurish but certainly unprofessional.”More Chelsea team news: Cesc Fàbregas has been training this week and could return against Cardiff City, in some capacity. As well as those lump in the throats of Emerson and Zappacosta, Maurizio Sarri has also confirmed that Ruben Loftus-Cheek picked up a knock on international duty with England, so he’s a doubt. I’m going to sneak off for a bit, and leave you Ben Fisher’s capable hands. You can email him here or tweet him here. I go as news breaks that Chelsea are suffering a sore-throat crisis, with both Emerson and Davide Zappacosta finding the infection sweeping the club hard to swallow. Bye for now! Oliver emails about the West Ham team-news leak story, decrying the leak culture which has surrounded the club over the last few years, and which is not limited to the mysterious @ExWHUemployee on Twitter. “Something really needs to change with the club, because these sorts of stories breaking out just serves to do nothing but undermine the playing staff, management, and club in general,” he writes. “Between the board and these other ‘in the know’ sources, there’s obviously way too many people willing to speak to others about what’s going on behind the scenes without the impact of that being thought about.”Pep Guardiola has revealed that Kevin de Bruyne has a release clause written into his contract. But before his many admirers start to get overexcited, the bad news is that they would have to cough up €250m to trigger it. “I’m sorry, he’s not for sale,” Guardiola said. “He’s very good. He’s a very dynamic player. De Bruyne does everything and everything well, but still has room to grow. I recently met his parents and understood a lot about why he is a fantastic guy.”Ahead of Fulham’s game against Manchester City, Slavisa Jokanovic has exclusively revealed that he wants his team to play well: We try to find our way, we try to adapt ourselves, we try to interpret what we have in our hands. We will choose what we believe is the best way for us to have the opportunity to win the game. Everyone knows how Manchester City play football, everyone knows what this team’s style is. “We are a team promoted from the Championship, we want to use similar weapons and we want to attack with possession of the ball. It’s not easy to compare us with City they have other records and targets to us. Anyway, we want to follow our way of playing football.There’s been a lot of talk of late about a mysterious twitter user who has been leaking West Ham’s line-ups for the last couple of years. This morning’s Times reports:Manuel Pellegrini is growing increasingly frustrated that news of his team selections at West Ham United is routinely being leaked before he has announced it to his players. The manager is aware that a Twitter account with the handle @ExWHUemployee has revealed the team for more than 60 matches in succession, including the four Premier League defeats over which he has presided this season, leading him to make inquiries as to the likely source.And finally, this is what Manuel Pellegrini said when asked if he was angry about it:So, in short, move on. There’s nothing to see here.Bournemouth have been busy over the international break, spending some of it training with the SAS. “We like to do things that stretch the players and give them new life skills,” says Eddie Howe.Here’s a hot take on Jurgen Klopp’s press conference:In shock news, Jurgen Klopp has ridiculed Gary Neville’s suggestion that Liverpool should improve their Premier League title prospects by treating the Champions League lightly.Last season’s Champions League runners-up open their campaign at home to Paris Saint Germain on Tuesday and, though Klopp admits he must rotate with seven games to play in 22 days, it will not be to dismiss the competition that Liverpool have won five times.When Neville’s proposal was explained to the Liverpool manager at Melwood this morning, he replied: “How should that work? What do we do? We don’t play Champions League or what? Gary should come over and tell me exactly how that would work. How do you prepare a game and not focus on it? You bring your kids in the Champions League? That would be funny.“I don’t know what he means with that, to be honest. We have to play football. A lot of people watch our games when we play Champions League and that’s our job that we do the best we can do in all these games. That’s what we try. I don’t know exactly what it means but to focus on one competition can only be if maybe you are already out of the competition nearly.“If it’s late in the season that you see you have a chance to do that or do this and all that stuff. Last year, for example, we had no chance to focus on one competition because we had to qualify for the Champions League and I don’t think that even Gary Neville would have said, ‘Quarter-finals of the Champions League, let City win.’ It doesn’t work like this. “I don’t want to be too critical because I don’t know exactly how he said it but sitting in an office and talking about football is completely different to doing the job, to be honest. But it’s an opinion. What did he say about Manchester United in that case? The club he’s more interested in. Nothing?”Here’s some Liverpool team news:Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana will miss the trip to Tottenham as a groin strain suffered on England duty is likely to sideline him for a fortnight. Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has recovered from a hand injury to take his place among the substitutes as back-up to Alisson Becker. Defender Dejan Lovren is still recovering from a hip injury, but should return in the next month. Those stats come from the Times’s interview with the always-interesting Troy Deeney. For example, his reaction to Gareth Southgate’s dismissal of his England chances is good. Here, for reference, is what Southgate said:I think Troy is a player who really suits the way that Watford play. I’m a big fan of his, I think what he brings to their team, the way he leads their team and the way that they play in the games that they have, but I think that we play slightly differently.Me personally, I’ve kind of given up on that dream. It’s not going to happen unless there’s a major crisis and someone who plays for Cheltenham gets injured. I might get a game then. I do respect his opinion because that’s his vision of where he wants to go and when you look at what he did at the World Cup, you have to tip your hat to him.To be honest, I just thought that comment of, ‘He’s great for Watford, but not for what we want,’ I thought it was downplaying Watford a little bit really, like we’re just some small team. I just think what it says as a message is that unless you’re a certain mould of player or play in a certain way, don’t worry about playing for England. That’s what I took from it. Strikerwise I don’t know what he wants. It can’t be mobility and getting around and scoring goals because at the minute that’s what I’m doing. Here’s a link to the interview (£):Interesting stats, these. They won’t help Troy Deeney win an England cap, but they do illustrate his effectiveness pretty well:Here’s some Cardiff team news:Josh Murphy will be assessed before Cardiff’s Premier League trip to Chelsea on Saturday. Murphy, the £11m summer recruit from Norwich, has been troubled by a slight hamstring over the last fortnight, and faces a late fitness test with manager Neil Warnock again expected to link Bobby Reid and Danny Ward in attack. Aron Gunnarsson is still nursing a knee problem after missing international duty with Iceland and is unlikely to be risked.Neil Warnock has given his pre-match press conference, in which he let slip a bit of transfer gossip. This from the Press Association:The Cardiff manager Neil Warnock wants to sign Chelsea and Wales teenager Ethan Ampadu on loan in January. The Bluebirds travel to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Saturday, and Warnock says he will speak to Chelsea officials about the prospect of signing Ampadu on loan in the next transfer window.Midfielder Ampadu, who celebrates his 18th birthday today, shone for Wales against the Republic of Ireland and Denmark during the international break. “I will be speaking to somebody at Chelsea about one or two things,” Warnock said. “I think they should loan him to us and I could help him as well. He doesn’t look out of place. What I like about him is that he is so confident.” More good reading for you, this time David Hytner’s interview with Nwankwo Kanu, who speaks about his own heart condition, and about his charitable foundation that provides treatment to children who need heart operations.It changed how I saw the world. For example, if you haven’t been in a hospital, you don’t really understand what is going on in there. I realised there was more to life than only to be comfortable on your own. You can open up to help others. I know the pain that I went through as an adult, so imagine how it is for kids. It’s difficult for them to take that pain. Here’s the bit of Mourinho’s press conference about Marcus Rashford that preceded the bit I quoted earlier. It is reminiscent of the rant about his record of promoting players from youth academies with which he introduced himself at United in 2016, only hopefully a little more factually accurate:If you don’t mind to lose a couple of minutes with me, I’m going to do something for the United fans. In the season 1617 Marcus Rashford played 32 Premier League matches, 11 Europa League matches including the final, three FA Cup matches, six League Cup matches including the final and the Community Shield. He had 53 appearances but if you want to take the minutes of play he played 3,068 minutes and if you want to ide that by 90 minutes he played 34.2 matches in 1617.In 1718 he played 35 matches in the Premier League, eight in the Champions League, five in the FA Cup including the final, three League Cup matches and the European Super Cup final. He played a total of 52 matches with 2,676 minutes. If you ide that by 90 gives 29.7 matches. So with me in two seasons he had 105 matches, 5,733 minutes, 63.7 matches of 90 minutes including five finals. So the people that is speaking about these minutes, I think they are a bit confused.And here’s Jamie Jackson’s take on Mourinho’s performance:Here’s a bit of encouraging analysis for Liverpool:Here’s a bit of south coastal team news:The Scotland winger Ryan Fraser is a doubt for Bournemouth’s Premier League match against Leicester because of a hamstring problem picked up on international duty. Left-back Charlie Daniels (knee) missed the defeat at Chelsea before the international break and remains unavailable. Midfielder Junior Stanislas, who last week signed a new three-year contract, continues his comeback from a knee injury.Florin Andone and José Izquierdo could make their first appearances of the season when Brighton travel to Southampton on Monday. Romania forward Andone, a summer signing from Deportivo La Coruña, has been sidelined with a groin problem, while Colombia winger Izquierdo has been building his fitness following his involvement in the World Cup. Albion boss Chris Hughton has no selection concerns ahead of the trip to St Mary’s, with defenders Bruno and Lewis Dunk available following their recent injuries.There has been a further update in the ongoing WatfordEvertonMarco Silva imbroglio. This from the Press Association: The Premier League has asked a law firm to investigate if Everton made an illegal approach for Marco Silva when he was Watford’s manager last season.Despite Premier League efforts to mediate between the two clubs, and hopes that Richarlison’s £40m move from Vicarage Road to Goodison Park meant relations had been restored, Watford’s anger over Everton’s autumn interest in Silva has not abated. As a result, the league has been forced to ask lawyers to start a preliminary, independent investigation. That is expected to take several months and if it suggests Everton do have a “tapping up” case to answer, the league would then appoint a QC-led commission which would have the power to impose a large fine and perhaps even a points deduction.There’s a slightly expanded version of the story here:This is a great yarn. You may want to tuck it behind your ear for some lunchtime reading, or you could consume it immediately like Jamie Vardy with a can of Red Bull. Either way, it’s worth a read.In response to a question from the floor suggesting he should be in the team more often, José Mourinho has pulled out a piece of paper in his press conference today and reeled off a load of statistics about the number of appearances Marcus Rashford has made under his management, how many minutes he has played, and how many major finals he has contributed to.The people who are speaking about his minutes, I think they’re a bit confused. Marcus Rashford is not Dominic Solanke, he’s not Ruben Loftus-Cheek, he’s not Dominic Calvert-Lewin, he’s Marcus Rashford, a Manchester United player with an incredible number of appearances and an incredible number of minutes played at the highest level and the biggest competitions. So for Manchester United supporters, to know what we’re doing with Marcus Rashford, with Jesse Lingard, with Luke Shaw, with Scott McTominay, that is what we are doing here.Leicester boss Claude Puel has warned Bournemouth Jamie Vardy is “refreshed and hungry” as he prepares to return to action at the Vitality Stadium. The striker has missed the last three matches through suspension following his straight red card during the home win against Wolves on August 18, and had a more relaxed international break after asking not to be considered for England duty.“He’s refreshed and will bring a good mentality,” said Puel, “and he is hungry.”A reminder of Vardy’s pre-match routine, and this isn’t even when he’s particularly hungry (as told to the Sun a couple of years ago): With a traditional 3pm Saturday kick-off, I’ll have a can of Red Bull as soon as I wake up, which is gone in 30 seconds. I don’t have breakfast and won’t eat anything until I have a cheese-and-ham omelette with baked beans at 11.30am. I wash that down with another Red Bull, which I also neck quickly.While we’re waiting and killing a bit of time, I have a double espresso. We get into the dressing room an hour and a half before kick-off, and I’ll have a third can of Red Bull straight away.Jurgen Klopp is chatting with Sky, ahead of his team’s trip to Tottenham. He’s asked first about the international break, and about flying his Brazilian trio home in a private jet:They’re all back, all fit, so it was a good break. We brought them back as comfortable as possible. On a plane like that it’s really comfortable so they could have a proper sleep. It’s the best way to do it. It’s absolutely not perfect, but it’s OK.Then he’s asked when we might get a glimpse of Fabinho:I’m not interested in it. It’s gone. The next game is Tottenham, it’s a completely different challenge. We have to see. It’s always a challenge. It’s always interesting, you never know exactly what will happen but I’m pretty sure we will have a good time in the next few weeks but we have to fight. It’s still early in the season. Four games only. It’s such a long season. We don’t have to talk about what happens at the end of the season. We have to play football and we really need to fight hard, not listening to all these softening words from you, how good we are, how we will challenge. We have to perform, we have to deliver results. We know that but it doesn’t work here in an interview, it works only on the pitch.Meanwhile, here are 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend:Today’s Rumour Mill includes the knockout news that the man behind Watford’s Harry the Hornet, Sam Allardyce and Roy Hodgson’s least favourite mascot, has hung up his comedy outsize head for the last time.Here’s some early team news, all for some reason (media bias, presumably) from London or not-far-from-London teams:Crystal Palace will be without Belgian striker Christian Benteke because of a knee problem for the Premier League trip to Huddersfield. Wilfried Zaha (groin) has returned to training and is being monitored. Defender James Tomkins (calf) has also stepped up his recovery so could be involved, but Scott Dann (knee) and Connor Wickham (calf) remain unavailable.Fulham must again do without captain Tom Cairney for the Premier League trip to Manchester City. The midfielder continues his recovery from a foot injury suffered against Burnley before the international break. Midfielder Neeskens Kebano (ankle) and defender Tim Ream (thigh) are also not yet available. Tottenham will be without Hugo Lloris and Dele Alli for the visit of Liverpool. Goalkeeper Lloris, who was sentenced this week for drink-driving, has been ruled out for several weeks with a thigh injury while England midfielder Alli has a hamstring problem sustained during the international break. Forward Son Heung-min is back from a lengthy stint of international duty, but Moussa Sissoko is still missing with a hamstring strain.Watford have no fresh injuries ahead of their bid for five wins from five Premier League games, against Manchester United on Saturday. Winger Gerard Deulofeu has been out with a groin problem in recent weeks and suffered a minor injury on his return to training, but should be back soon. Midfielder Tom Cleverley, still suffering from an achilles injury, is the Hornets’ only long-term absentee. And lo, the weekend is upon us. This one features the following Premier League fixtures, about which I’ll be bringing you the very latest preaction and team news as the day unfolds:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/536cd1016e0758ddcb18d70c049239c11b6aed80/717_694_4619_2771/master/4619.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7780b52102a622594c6fd6e71b708735","title":"i crossed alps on a space hopper experience","story":"I bought an original 1970s hopper on eBay and practised on a nearby hill At the start of 2015, my life unexpectedly went belly up. Within the space of three months, my father died, I was made redundant, I split up with my fiancee and I was diagnosed with leukemia. It was an awful time, but once I had sold our home, I started to think about how I could turn my misfortune into an opportunity. With no job, house or relationship, I had the time to do anything I wanted. That is how I ended up spending several months researching and re-enacting a 14th-century pilgrimage.I am not religious, but I thought a 200-mile walk across southern England would give me time away from my troubles and help me decide where my life was going. The experience was so fulfilling I made a second trip the following winter, travelling through Wales in a coracle.I also started spending some of my free time working on projects to help homeless people in Chichester, where I live. One afternoon, I took a homeless friend, Paul, for a meal, where he told me about his determination to find a job and the difficulty of doing so without a permanent address. “It’s virtually impossible,” he said. “It’s like trying to cross the Alps on a space hopper.” I had been wondering what I could do for my next journey – and there it was. “Don’t be stupid,” said Paul. “You’ll die! It’s not going to happen.” So then I had to do it.I bought an original 1970s space hopper on eBay and practised on a nearby hill through the snowy spring of 2018. I realised my Alpine adventure would have to take place in the summer – space hoppers don’t perform well in icy conditions – and discovered that slopes are more easily tackled on a child-sized hopper, whereas adult-sized ones are better suited to flat bouncing. I researched routes and found one that seemed feasible – 76 miles between Bardonecchia in Italy and Grenoble in France. I visited my GP, who assured me my leukaemia shouldn’t affect the journey, other than increasing tiredness. I arrived in Bardonecchia on 1 August and set off in a tweed suit, partly to avoid insect bites, and an 1880s pith helmet, to keep the sun off my head and neck and protect me from falling rocks. That first day was a killer. I had planned my route so most of the toughest bouncing took place at the start, but by noon the temperature was 30C. On steep gradients, I had to pause every 10 bounces to make sure I didn’t get cramp I quickly factored in a lengthy siesta at 11am each day. I had made sure there was a cheap B\u0026ampB or refuge to stay overnight every five miles along the route. Travelling at a little over half a mile an hour and putting in eight or nine hours a day, I usually made my target, although a couple of times I had to sleep rough.Some slopes were too steep for bouncing and I had to deflate my hopper and climb. Occasionally, the terrain was littered with sharp stones I lost my first hopper to a puncture on day five. Fortunately, I had three spares. Most people en route dismissed me as an English eccentric, although many were politely intrigued. On one occasion, a local man offered me a huge meal and homemade wine. I fell asleep on his porch, then spent a very uncomfortable afternoon trying to bounce on a full stomach. After that, I limited myself to energy bars and water until the evening. As the days wore on, my many aches started to feel permanent. I suffered heatstroke, altitude sickness and then lost a second hopper to fatigue after I fell asleep on a mountainside. With the end in sight, near-disaster struck when I twisted my knee. A hiker helped me bandage it and I pressed on, despite the pain. I had picked up a sizeable Facebook following while posting daily updates and some urged me to quit, but the last three days were mostly downhill. So on I bounced, finishing in agony on day 17. In Grenoble, I posted a video explaining my motivation and encouraging followers to approach homeless people with offers of help.Back in Chichester, I seized up completely and spent five days on my hands and knees. When I next saw Paul, his life had picked up a little he now had a toe-hold in a shelter. But we both knew his struggle was gruelling compared with my self-imposed one. He was keen to know what I am planning for next year, though.

I learned to drive only this year. I still can’t ride a bike, and every aspect of me using the washing machine is a barely educated guess (“No, no, it’s not a red top in with the whites,” I say. “It’s millennial pink”). But, often, I can’t figure out why I feel as if I have missed a crucial meeting.For some reason, you are expected to just know stuff you are supposed to know how to wire a plug, what a balance transfer is, how to spot bad grouting. Worse still, you are expected to be an “expert” at something. But I am not an expert in anything – and some of the most basic tenets of adulthood leave me wondering if they are not all an elaborate prank.Take parking tickets. We are just supposed to pay those, are we? A person I have never met says – and not even to my face – that I owe them money and I just have to pay, regardless of whether I agree? When in any other situation in life is such a deal allowed, aside from a mugging? Each year there seem to be more and more urgent payments that need seeing to:the 200th iPhone cable you need to buy the appliance that conked out the day the warranty expired. Sometimes, it seems as if adulthood is less about having a heightened state of consciousness and more about paying for things. The older you get, the more to pay for (“I pay, therefore I am”).Yet everyone seems very calm about this. I never see any twentysomethings walking around looking shell-shocked and weeping into their empty wallets. Perhaps this is simply the cost of doing business at this stage of life, a kind of adulthood tax. Can’t they just call it that, in the interest of transparency? It wouldn’t take much, an advert here or there: “Introducing the adulthood tax, a payment to cover life’s small yet frequent kicks to the balls.”Better still, call it a membership feefor adulthood. Although, having had an extensive trial, I am really not sure it is for me.

Here We Go Again. “In 2018, Netflix plans to spend approximately $8bn on content worldwide, across more than 700 television and film productions,” the company said. “We would like to be able to produce more in the UK. However, we are limited by the lack of available space.”A shortage of filming space has led to a flurry of pop-up studio sites in the UK, including a former military airbase in Yorkshire where the ITV hit Victoria was filmed and a carpet warehouse in Neasden, north London, used as the filming base for another ITV production, Mr Selfridge. More established sites are full. Disney, which is making the latest Star Wars trilogy in the UK, has permanently reserved slots at Pinewood, Shepperton’s sister studio in Buckinghamshire. Warner Brothers has an 80-hectare site at Leavesden where it shot the Harry Potter films and the Fantastic Beasts prequels. While Netflix is yet to officially enter negotiations to secure long-term studio space in the UK, the need for its own production hub is clear. In July Netflix announced the establishment of its first European production hub, in Madrid, at a new 22,000 sq metre campus called Ciudad de la Tele (TV City), as the company looks to make 20 original productions this year in Spain. Netflix is making double the number of productions in the UK compared to Spain, including new seasons of The Crown and Black Mirror and the historical film The King, which is based on Shakepeare’s King Henry plays and will require more than 20,000 cast, crew and extras. Netflix is one of many players, including Hollywood studios and TV companies such as the BBC and ITV, that are finding it increasingly difficult to book studio space, potentially costing the UK film and TV industry billions of pounds in lost bookings. New figures from Pinewood Group suggest that between 2015 and 2017 the UK has missed out on films worth £2.8bn – the cost of making eight Hollywood blockbusters – which have been “lost” to overseas locations as space could not be booked in the UK on the timelines required for shooting. Victoria is being shot at Church Fenton, a military site in North Yorkshire. Sally Joynson, the chief executive of Screen Yorkshire, said the county was losing business because of a lack of large-scale studio space and turned to Church Fenton – a wartime airbase that moved into private hands after it was decommissioned – to try to solve the problem. “We made an approach and asked if we could use the site for productions,” said Joynson. “At that point it was effectively a pop-up space. We had to use alternative venues and pop-up spaces. The production we wanted to get in there fell through but because demand was so high Victoria came along.” In 2013 a tax break for TV productions costing at least £1m an episode was introduced. Last year spend on seven-figure episodes – the definition of a high-end series – rocketed to almost £1bn. Almost three-quarters of that has been financed by deep-pocketed overseas players such as the NetflixSony for the co-production of The Crown, HBO for Game of Thrones and Amazon for Outlander. The UK film industry is also riding the crest of the production boom, with investment doubling to £2bn annually in less than a decade.Mark Passer, an associate director at Lambert Smith Hampton, a property firm that specialises in film and TV space, said alternative sites such as the Neasden carpet factory were becoming increasingly popular. “ITV invested a significant amount into the property to make it usable due to a lack of availability in traditional studios. Alternative space has had an increasingly important role to play in satisfying demand in the stretched studio market.”A new report from LSH argues that new production space equivalent to 100 football pitches will be needed in the UK tomeet the demand from the film and high-end TV industry over the next 15 years.On Monday Jeremy Wright, the new culture secretary, will make one of his first major public appearances to break ground for the final stage of a £200m expansion of Pinewood.“There has been a huge boom in drama production driven by the likes of Amazon and Netflix,” said Joynson. “There is pressure on locations and studio space at times supply doesn’t always keep up with demand. It is a very good problem to have, but only if you can find ways to address the issue.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e302920a5534f8aade7d5a187516e24869129d2/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebfc2d589ac70411966e71fde857d0e3","title":"why pete doherty and other rock relics are swapping records for real estate","story":"The Libertines frontman has bought a hotel in Margate. Maybe it’s time Johnny Borrell got on the property ladder too?Modern Toss on pension plans for musicians...Images of Libertines frontman, occasional poet and former military jacket apologist Pete Doherty polishing off a gutbuster breakfast challenge at a caff in Cliftonville, near Margate, rocked thirtysomething Twitter recently. Four rashers of bacon, four eggs, four sausages, hash browns, onion rings, bubble and squeak, two slices of thick bread, and a quarter-pounder burger and chips disappeared into the Libertine without a trace. A meme was born.Closer readers would have been just as intrigued to learn that the Libertines have relocated to Margate where they are in the process of opening a hotel and recording studio. In short, they have a business ecosystem: they’ve taken the music and turned it into bricks and mortar. This is far easier to comprehend than how Pete put away those bangers. Hit by the twin calamities of the death of indie and the death of people paying for albums, ersification ought to be the watchword for his musical generation. Yes, 2015’s Anthems for Doomed Youth album peaked at No 3, but the Libertines’ recent appearance at Broadstairs’ Wheels \u0026amp Fins festival alongside Feeder and Faithless hardly suggests zeitgeist-riding relevance.The paradox of the past decade has been that digital culture has never been more accessible and never more poorly remunerated, while people are paying more than ever for physical stuff. Instagrammable experience culture has taken the place of all those tenners we used to spend at HMV. Having a band HQ, a site of personal pilgrimage that fans can use to selfie-up, to treat as a pop-up shrine, is a way of taking your cachet and monetising it. Last time anyone heard, Shane MacGowan still had a flat above the Boogaloo bar in north London, adding considerably to the legend of an otherwise unremarkable pub.Surely, Johnny Borrell could do just as well taking the remaining royalties for America and opening “Borrell’s”, a Soho eatery, foisting small plates of cremated octopus at food buffs with the same cockiness he once proclaimed himself “the best songwriter of my generation”? After all, Interpol’s Daniel Kessler once co-owned New York foodie haunt Bergen Hill, and Pigeon Detectives frontman Matt Bowman was an early innovator, sinking all those Take Her Back royalties into York boozer Montey’s (now Gibsons). In fact, the only shame is that these early-00s indie extracurricular endeavours have been largely in the hospitality trade. Why not the Darkness’ self-consciously camp Spandex yoga studio? Why not “Reverend” John McClure’s Che-worshipping bong shop? And for the Kooks – recently seen breaking back into the UK Top 10 – how about a very on-trend, mindfulness-inducing silent retreat, eh Luke?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff2d4b0a6f7c1bb72395a0b3f14a599081790d4/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=befccf24b044b2d19702ca4a8e600399","title":"finally a cure for insomnia","story":"We are living through an epidemic of sleeplessness, but the medical establishment has largely ignored the problem. Can a radical new therapy help you get some sleep?We live in a golden age of sleeplessness. The buzz of the all-night streetlamps, the natter of 24-hour news anchors, the scrolling Niagaras of social media feeds have built a world that is hostile to sleep. Night is no longer clearly delineated from day. The bedroom is no longer a refuge from the office. The physical and psychic walls that once held back the tides of work and social interaction have failed. As the essayist Jonathan Crary put it, sleeplessness is the inevitable symptom of an era in which we are encouraged to be both unceasing consumers and unceasing creators.To the wakeful, insomnia can feel like the loneliest affliction in the world. But an estimated third of British adults suffer from chronic insomnia, defined as having adequate opportunity but inadequate ability to sleep, for a period of at least six months. Insomniacs dutifully set aside a seven-or-so-hour stretch for rest. They make the bed. They draw the curtains. But when ear kisses pillow, they are suddenly wakeful. Many have sought help. Between 1993 and 2007, the number of people in the UK who visited their doctor complaining of insomnia nearly doubled, while NHS data shows, in the past decade, a tenfold increase in the number of prescriptions written for melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep.The effects of insomnia can be ruinous. In his recent bestseller, Why We Sleep, the neuroscientist Matthew Walker wrote: “The decimation of sleep throughout industrialised nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our life expectancy, our safety, our productivity and the education of our children.” A 2016 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, claims that insomnia increases the risk of heart attack, cancer and obesity. Insomniacs are far more likely than sound sleepers to suffer from chronic depression. Insomnia is related to all major psychiatric conditions, including suicide risk (although there is still a debate as to whether sleeplessness is the cause or the symptom). Each year, as many as 1.2m car crashes in the UScan be attributed to tired drivers.None of this is news to the droopily Googling insomniac who, fearing obesity, heart disease, accident and poverty, is subjected to yet further sleep-skewering anxiety. Fearing their problem is untreatable, or that no doctor will take them seriously, many people who suffer from insomnia never seek medical advice. And in Britain, where doctors are hesitant to prescribe sleep drugs for longer than a week or two, who can blame the insomniac? There are a few NHS sleep clinics in the UK, where patients can be tested for the respiratory issues that often cause sleeplessness, but waiting lists are dispiritingly long. Moreover, for decades, inside the British medical establishment there has been only a glancing interest in insomnia, a specialism that one consultant refers to as the “Cinderella of medicine”.“We have very little at our disposal,” Clare Aitchison, a GP with a practice in Norwich, told me. “In a 10-minute consultation it’s impossible to teach people to break bad habits.” With so few options, doctors resort to advisory cliches. Take a hot shower before bed. Eat a banana. Switch off your phone. Read a book. Masturbate. These titbits often have some basis in science or logic. But when the insomniac has tried them all (sometimes simultaneously) where do they turn?At the root of Selsick’s approach is a revolutionary assertion that has led to a new approach to treatment, quite unlike the old wives’ tales with which, in the absence of a coherent medical solution, every insomniac will be familiar. Where, for decades, insomnia has been treated as a symptom of another issue (if indeed it has been treated at all) Selsick contends that insomnia is not merely a symptom, but a disorder in its own right. This remains an unorthodox view. Yet, for Selsick’s patients, the approach does more than fix a category error: it provides a life-changing validation, a route out of helplessness, a way of getting to sleep.I have come to hate my bedroom. What should be a place of rest and, in a good month, the odd romantic scuffle, has become a psychic battleground. Since I turned 18, the process of drifting off has become ever more easily torn. The pops and creaks of the settling house are enough to pull my wary brain from its slow descent. The sound of a lorry, or an orgasmic fox, can keep me tossing fretfully till 3am, the hour at which, as Ray Bradbury put it, we insomniacs glumly watch as “the moon rolls by ... with its idiot face”.In the nagging light of the alarm clock, emotions grow heightened. The slightest wiggle, tut or guff from a bed partner is enough to arouse fury, as I’m whooshed back to a state of bounding wakefulness. The paradoxical exasperation of the insomniac is this: the more you try to sleep, the more you fail. So here I must lie, tipping from fury to dismay, contemplating the various ways in which the coming day is fucked.It is impossible to explain to the sound sleeper what it is like to not sleep. Still, the writers and artists try. “Night is always a giant,” wrote Vladimir Nabokov, of the foreboding sense of peril he felt on entering his bedroom. (One of Nabokov’s insomniac characters wished for a third side after trying and failing to fall asleep on the two he had). Chuck Palahniuk, whose novel Fight Club was inspired by insomnia, would have to imagine picking and losing fights in order to drift off. F Scott Fitzgerald, not a writer prone to hyperbole, described insomnia with sullen childishness as “the worst thing in the world”.Over the years I have developed rituals and incantations: the solemn depositing of the phone in a separate room, the scorching shower, the banana nightcap. As the fear of sleeplessness builds over weeks and months, obsessive, quasi-superstitious behaviours become established. Vincent van Gogh would pour a turpentine-like liquid on his mattress, a decanting intended to cast the spell of sleep. WC Fields claimed he could only fall asleep to the sound of rainfall, and his dutiful lover Carlotta Monti would spray water from the garden hose against the bedroom window till he dropped off (today, a range of apps can provide similar soothing soundscapes).These eccentricities have, perhaps, enabled the rest of the world to view insomnia as a minor affliction. As well as feeling scorned, the insomniac comes to develop a sense of shame. Sleep is the most natural thing in the world to fail makes the sufferer somehow unnatural. So it was with panda eyes and an anxious mind that I slipped through the front door of the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine in Great Ormond Street, London, to meet the doyen of insomniacs.Hugh Selsick cannot be absolutely certain, but he estimates that he has met more insomnia sufferers than any other person in Britain. Yet, when he enters the waiting room for his insomnia clinic, he has no idea which one of the expectant faces is his patient. Most long-term insomniacs show none of the telltale physical signs of fatigue. It’s a hidden, private affliction.Selsick places extraordinary importance on this initial meeting with a new patient. He knows that they may have been suffering from insomnia for decades, a period over which they have seen multiple family doctors, who have time and again given them the kind of advice you might give a fretful child: take a warm bath or a glass of milk before bed. When he sits down with the patient for the first time, Selsick’s primary goal is simply to let them know, perhaps for the first time in their lives, that someone is about to take them seriously.“For years nobody has understood what this person is going through,” he told me, as we sat in his narrow office. “Then suddenly they are sitting in front of someone who says, ‘Yes, I can see this is a problem, and yes, we can treat this.’” Some patients well up. Others hold their heads in their hands, in shocked relief. Whatever the reaction, Selsick, who is soft-spoken, kind-eyed and bald as an acorn, said that, in that moment, a bond of trust is established that is stronger than any other he has known in his career as a psychiatric doctor.In this, our first meeting, I felt something of that emotional intimacy. Through shame, or a worry that he might think I was trying to jump the waiting list, I had not mentioned my own struggles with sleeplessness. His kind manner, and open acknowledgment of the pervasive awfulness of insomnia, was both comforting and thrilling.Still, the insomnia clinic’s reputation has not been made on bedside manner alone. Selsick has designed a five-week programme that combines cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), designed to break a person’s negative associations with their bedroom, and the entire business of drifting off, with something Selsick terms “sleep efficiency training”, a calibrated reduction of the amount of time the patient spends in bed.Today, Selsick and another consultant run the clinic with support from a GP who works one day a week and an associate specialist psychiatrist, who is supported by a trainee. Patients travel from around the country to visit, and about 80 patients visit the clinic’s weekly group classes. “We are constantly expanding, but we are still battling to meet the demand,” Selsick said.How is a central London clinic successfully treating an illness that, for decades, medicine has failed to adequately address? The answer appears to be rooted in Selsick’s belief that insomnia is not merely a symptom of another, higher-order condition. For decades doctors would treat the primary condition – diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems – expecting that fixing this would help the patient to sleep. This approach would often fail because, as one study puts it, insomnia is maintained by the “behaviours, cognitions and associations that patients adopt as they attempt to cope with poor sleep but that end up backfiring”.Selsick believes that only by treating insomnia as a psychiatric disorder, with degrees of severity that range from mild to chronic, can the health service begin to develop and prescribe appropriate treatments. It is a pioneering attitude that is motivated not only by scientific curiosity, but by personal experience Selsick knows insomnia’s debilitating effects first-hand.Selsick became an insomniac in 1993, when he was 19 years old, staying on a kibbutz in the desert in Israel. It wasn’t just the heat that caused his sleeplessness it was also the routine built around the heat. With temperatures reaching 40C, desert-dwelling people typically sleep from 11pm through to 3am, at which point they start work while it is still cool enough. At lunchtime, when the heat is at its most ferocious, they take a siesta. It was a custom that Selsick’s mind resisted he would lie awake in the afternoons, feeling exhausted, but wired.When he returned to South Africa to start his first year at university, studying medicine in Johannesburg, Selsick’s insomnia persisted and intensified. “It’s almost impossible to describe what it’s like, to someone who hasn’t had it,” he told me. One day on campus he saw an advert posted on a wall requesting volunteers for a sleep study. Selsick enrolled in the hope that he might discover what was happening to him.The study hoped to find what effect, if any, calorie intake had on a person’s ability to fall asleep. Each experiment lasted for four days, during which Selsick and the other volunteers would stay overnight at the sleep clinic, one monitor strapped to their head, another, to monitor core body temperature, inserted into their rectum. Volunteers were kept to a specific diet. One week they would fast for 24 hours the next eat three times their typical calorie intake. Then they were monitored to see what effect the food had on their sleep. “It turned out to not make a difference,” he recalled.Inspired by the professor who ran the course, Selsick began a postgraduate degree in physiology, based within the sleep clinic, where he studied the functions of REM sleep – a phase that occurs sporadically through the night, characterised by rapid eye movements – then carried out research on the impact of central heating on sleep patterns. (The ideal temperature in which to sleep is cooler than you might think: just 18C. This is one of the reasons why insomnia affects a disproportionate number of people in nursing homes, where round-the-clock heating makes it harder for the human body to cool down in readiness for sleep.)At this time, the use of psychotherapy to treat insomnia was still in a relatively early phase. Selsick estimates that it was 2005 before therapists began to undergo insomnia training, in order to apply research findings. When Selsick came to London in the late 90s as a trainee doctor at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, his own insomnia had passed. Still, he was astonished to find a widespread lack of interest within psychiatry toward insomnia. “Ask any patient with psychiatric conditions what troubles them,” he said. “Sleep is almost always at the top of the list.” Selsick started a mailing list for any psychiatrists who were interested in sleep and held a conference at which members shared their findings. The group caught the attention of his supervisor, Charlotte Feinmann, a consultant psychiatrist at University College London Hospitals (UCLH) who, while Googling “insomnia”, recognised Selsick’s name in a search result. She sent him a text message asking whether he would be interested in founding an insomnia clinic at the hospital.“At that time nobody was treating insomnia,” Selsick recalled. “Mental health units weren’t taking insomnia patients sleep disorder centres were not treating insomnia, partly because they were being run by respiratory physicians screening for sleep apnoea, who didn’t have the relevant skills.” A patient who did not fit that box would be “bounced around the NHS”, Feinmann said. While staff across the health service were aware of the need, Selsick said, they knew that if they were to take insomnia referrals they would be inundated.Selsick accepted Feinmann’s offer and, in November 2009, his first two patients walked into the clinic. He started small – one afternoon a week. “I had no idea what I was doing,” he recalled. Indeed, in its early months, Selsick’s consultancy offered little more than routine advice on basic sleep hygiene, such as limiting caffeine intake (“not effective”) and some general tinkering with the dosage of whatever medication the patient was already taking (“not very effective”).Then, a few months later, Selsick began to explore CBT. For those who suffer from insomnia, the bedroom is so strongly associated with wakefulness that the mere act of going to bed wakes the patient up, in much the same way that walking into a dentist’s office makes you anxious. CBT, which at the time was just starting to be used to treat insomnia in North America, works to change patients’ automatic, often unconscious, association of the bedroom with wakefulness and replace it with bedroom and sleep. “Immediately,” Selsick said, “our results were enormously better.”Not everyone was convinced by the new programme. Selsick’s clinic is situated within the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, formerly known as the Royal London Homoeopathic hospital, a controversial centre for alternative treatments. The pharmacologist David Colquhoun once described the hospital as a “great national embarrassment”. Selsick believes that this association caused some GPs to not refer their insomniac patients. “When we explain that we are a psychiatry-led service that practices evidence-based medicine, those issues usually melt away,” he explained.Ideally, the patient’s answers establish a pattern, which can lead to a diagnosis. Sometimes that diagnosis is narcolepsy, nocturnal epilepsy or sleepwalking – one of the scores of conditions that can lead to sleeplessness. In other cases it is, simply, psychiatric insomnia.When she was 13 years old, Zehavah Handler took a pen and scrawled a dot on her bedroom wall in north-west London. Lying on the bed, she could just pick out the mark in the milky glow of her nightlight. There, as the house settled around her, she would challenge herself to stare at the dot for as long as possible without blinking. The game became a ritual and, eventually, became the only way, she believed, that she could fall asleep – although it was often 4am before she finally drifted off.In adulthood Handler, now 40 and a mother of four, still suffered from insomnia. She would wake at 7am to drop her children off at school, then lie down on the carpet of her bedroom. There she would watch the ceiling till mid-afternoon, her heart palpitating with exhaustion, when she would leave for the school pickup. After feeding and bathing the children, Handler would retire to her own bed. She would lie in bed for 12 hours, only sleeping for an hour or so before the dawn broke and the day’s grim routine began again.When she began to experience memory loss and irritability, Handler visited her GP. After an 18-month wait, she entered Selsick’s office. “It was the first time I met a professional who acknowledged the problem and was truly empathetic.” Handler was admitted to UCLH’s clinic to be monitored overnight for sleep apnoea. On arrival, Handler found the consultant in charge that night “extremely dismissive” of Selsick’s clinic. She spent the first night in a nest of wires, like an android recharging its batteries, lying awake worried about whether or not the machines would know that she was just pretending to be asleep. Nevertheless, the results came back clear: she had no breathing issues, no twitching muscles. Selsick concluded that Handler was one of his many patients for whom insomnia is not a symptom of some other disorder, but the disorder itself.In May 2016, Handler joined Selsick’s five-week course, along with nine other anxious patients. The programme takes place in a small room in the bowels of the hospital. Handler remembers that none of her fellow patients talked and few made eye contact, paralysed by the secret shame of the insomniac. “Everybody was very self-conscious,” she recalled. “We were wondering: ‘How’s it going to work? How much will we have to reveal of ourselves?”To figure out how much sleep they need, each attendee is told to start a sleep diary, recording what time they go to bed, what time they get up, how long it took to fall asleep and how many times they wake during the night. Next Selsick undoes the idea that a person should have a set bedtime. Typically, insomniacs will go to bed earlier or stay in bed longer in order to increase their sleep opportunity. The logic appears sound – if I’m not getting enough sleep, I should spend longer in bed to give myself more opportunity to sleep – but the anxiety invariably exacerbates the problem. Instead, patients are told to set a hard-and-fast time to wake up. “We tell them to always get up at the same time every day, regardless of how much they’ve slept, what time they’ve gone to bed, or what they’ve got to do that day.”There must never be any lie-ins, and never any naps (chewing gum, Selsick says, keeps napping at bay). The theory is that if you get up at the same time every morning, you begin to feel sleepy at the same time every night, and, over the weeks, your bedtime will naturally become consistent. “We compress their time in bed down so that their sleep is more compact and tighter,” explained Selsick. A patient might start with a goal of six hours’ sleep. If they need to be up for work at 7am, this means they are forbidden from entering the bedroom till 1am. “That’s now your earliest permitted bedtime.”Selsick worked to break the negative associations Handler had with her bedroom. When insomniacs go to bed they often feel afraid of having to lie there frustrated and increasingly irritated. After a while the simple act of going to bed begins to wake an insomniac up. The bedroom becomes a trigger toward alertness, even fear. To counter this, Selsick urges patients to leave the bedroom after just 15 minutes if they are not yet asleep. All activity apart from sex and sleep is barred from the bedroom. Patients are even told to change their clothes in another room.“Before, I would go to sleep in the afternoon and be in my room for 12 hours,” said Handler. I would make all my phone calls there, work on my laptop there, eat and watch TV in bed. That’s gone. All gone. I say goodbye to my room at about 7.20am and I don’t see it again until 1.30am when I go to bed.” The technique often feels counterintuitive on the initial nights that a patient shuffles between bedroom and lounge every 15 minutes, they often sleep worse. “It’s extraordinarily hard to do,” she said. But after about five weeks, the negative psychological association of the bedroom with wakefulness has been broken, and replaced with new, positive connections. Selsick claims that, using these techniques alongside the moderation of stimulants such as caffeine, eight out of 10 patients get better, and half of these go into, he said, “complete remission”.Studies show that CBT is the most effective long-term treatment for insomnia. But in order for it to be effective, it requires the patient to establish and maintain a stable routine. For patients who regularly cross time-zones, who often stay in unfamiliar hotel beds or who are unable to form a nightly ritual because of work, Selsick’s plan presents an impossible target. These patients want not a timetable to which they must stick, but a pill they can swallow.Surprisingly perhaps, for a doctor who strongly advocates the use of CBT in treating insomnia, Selsick believes that sleeping pills should be far more widely prescribed in the UK. “There’s an incredible conservatism in the British medical establishment about prescribing for sleep,” he said. Much of this anxiety is focused on the addictive qualities of benzodiazepines. According to the neuroscientist Matthew Walker, sleeping pills do not provide “natural sleep,” can “damage health” and “increase the risk of life-threatening diseases”.“The drugs, like any drug, are not without risk,” said Selsick. “But having untreated insomnia also comes with risks.” Selsick has met patients who, because of insomnia, have been forced to leave work and abandon careers. “I’ve had patients where it’s destroyed their marriages, where they have lost access to their kids because they are so tired that they can’t look after them properly.” Nevertheless, Selsick perceives a blanket policy among doctors whereby they refuse to medicate for sleep. This policy, he says, does patients a disservice. “Yes, CBT should be your first port of call prior to medication. But most places in the country do not have access to CBT. And not everyone who does CBT for insomnia gets better.”The arrival of any epidemic brings commercial opportunities. In 2006, the manufacturer of the non-benzodiazepine sleeping pill Ambien estimated that the drug had been taken 12bn times worldwide and is worth $2bn a year in American sales. Pharmaceutical companies hoping to replicate this success are locked in a race to design a new sleeping pill without side-effects. The discovery, in 1998, of orexin, a hormone that essentially works as the brain’s alarm clock, turned the long march to develop a new kind of sleeping pill into a sprint.For the past 15 years Jean-Paul Clozel – a cardiologist turned pharmacologist who in 1997, co-founded the Swiss biotech firm Actelion with his wife, Martine – has been leading the development of what he claims to be the side-effect-free sleeping pill. “Most sleeping pills are benzodiazepines,” says Clozel. “They induce something that feels like sleep, but in reality, it’s closer to anaesthetic sedation.” (Benzodiazepines are often used by anaesthetists.) Clozel’s pill, which he hopes to take to market in 2020, and which goes by the generic name Nemorexint, works differently. It limits the production of orexin, the hormone that keeps insomniacs awake, or causes them to wake up at the mildest provocation.Nemorexint is not the first sleeping pill to target orexin. Since August 2014, more than a decade after work began on developing the drug, American doctors could prescribe Belsomra, also known as Suvorexant, which targets the same hormone. Within a month of its release, US doctors were writing an average of 4,000 Belsomra prescriptions a week. But the drug is not without risks. An FDA report on the safety of Belsomra, which is closely related to Clozel’s drug, quoted one patient who “woke up several times and felt unable to move her arms and legs and unable to speak”.Nevertheless, in a country that is seemingly years away from rolling-out nationwide CBT programmes to treat insomnia, Selsick welcomes the chance to prescribe Neomorexint. “As it acts through a completely different pathway than other hypnotics, it would be nice to have it for those patients who have not responded to the standard treatments.”In the meantime, Britain remains both ill-equipped and, seemingly, unwilling to deal with the growing insomnia epidemic. As victims of the woefully ignored Cinderella of medicine, sufferers struggle to stick with anything that claims to be a cure, leaving us stuck in folklore, with its colourful but contradictory advice. No sleeping pills are licensed for long-term usage, and apart from Selsick’s clinic, only a handful of private psychology services offer CBT to treat insomnia.A plan to open an insomnia clinic at the sleep disorders centre at Guy’s hospital was scrapped due to fears that the demand would be too great. “They were concerned that demand would be so massive they would never meet their waiting list targets, which would result in being financially penalised,” Selsick said. This has resulted in the perverse situation where the more demand that exists to treat insomnia, the less likely it is to be met.In May, to help ease the pressure on his oversubscribed clinic, Selsick commissioned the first insomnia training programme for GPs, an attempt to equip doctors to run, within their local surgeries, CBT sessions similar to those held at the clinic. Eventually, he hopes, this will mean that only the most extreme cases will need to be referred to him. Selsick hopes to run these courses, which are also open to nurses, psychologists, occupational therapists and mental health workers, twice a year and, in doing so, speed up the NHS’s capacity to deal with insomnia at a national scale.Selsick’s clinic is the only surgery to consistently see a significant volume of patients. And consistency is, he said, the key. “The treatment is not rocket science,” he said. “It really isn’t. Our job, primarily, as therapists, is not so much to tell people what to do – because we could just give it to them as a handout – but to convince them to do it for long enough for it to work.”For patients who successfully complete Selsick’s programme, the ability to sleep well changes life at an elemental level. To begin sleeping again is to feel as though you are being realigned with the universe and its guiding, imperceptible rhythms. “I am happier,” Handler told me, of her new life, post-insomnia. “My relationships have improved. I have more patience. I’m no longer walking in a permanent fog. I am available.”There are occasional relapses, Handler said, usually brought on by a change in routine – a holiday away, Christmas – but by waking at a set time, leaving the bedroom after 15 minutes if she remains awake and re-implementing all of the rituals she learned at the Insomnia Clinic, it only takes a few nights to re-establish the routine.The effect has been so transformative that Handler has decided to close her tourism business and, with Selsick’s support, retrain as a sleep counsellor. So great is her relief at learning how to sleep again that Handler wants to dedicate her life to helping others do the same she plans to open her own insomnia clinic next year.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ce29e173287767c534c94d5812b84e6a16411a6/123_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c53f0e660980592b4091c97cf9ed9fe","title":"aping each other how similar are humans and orangutans","story":"From umbrella-making to learning how to self-medicate, we share plenty of skills with our fellow great apesWhen scientists talk about animals using tools, they’re not normally talking about the implements you might use to knock up some shelves. But while animals generally confine themselves to bashing things with the odd rock, in extraordinary footage broadcast last year as part of the BBC’s Spy in the Wild series, a wild female orangutan is seen using a saw she has found outside a hut to cut through a log – even pausing to blow away sawdust before continuing.In the wild, orangutans use large sticks to get at honey inside logs, shelter from the rain by fashioning umbrellas out of leaves and hold bunches of leaves in front of their mouths to lower the pitch of their calls to scare off predators. Captive orangutans have been taught to use hammers, screwdrivers and keys.Researchers have even shown that orangutans learn and generate new sounds – an ability until recently considered largely the preserve of humans. The ability to consciously vibrate twin bands of muscle tissue in the larynx called vocal folds – important in generating many new sounds – was thought to have evolved after we erged from chimpanzees, our closest great ape relatives, some 5-7m years ago.Then, an international team of researchers caught wind of reports of a male orangutan called Rocky using sounds reminiscent of the plaintive groans made by Chewbacca, of Star Wars fame, to attract the attention of his keepers at Indianapolis Zoo. In a study published in 2016, the group compared Rocky’s call to other known orangutan sounds and found it to be novel.They then taught him to imitate a human who was making versions of his call at different pitches. “This shows the ability to change the frequency of calls through control of the vocal folds was likely to have predated the last common ancestor of humans and orangutans,” says Prof Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University, one of the study’s authors.Orangutans have also been shown to have human-like, long-term memories. In 2009, Danish scientists showed a group of orangutans and chimps how to retrieve a piece of banana by reaching through a slot with the longer of two sticks, and then hid the sticks in boxes in nearby rooms. Three years later, all bar one of the orangutans knew what to do to get the food in the same set-up.Just as the list of tool-using animals has grown in recent years, so too has the list of those that use plants as medicine. Lizards eat certain roots to counter snake venom, macaws consume clay to aid digestion as well as to gain minerals, and pregnant lemurs nibble tamarind and fig leaves to boost milk production. Orangutans are among a smaller group of primates that self-medicate by rubbing substances into their fur.Behavioural ecologist Helen Morrogh-Bernard, of Exeter University, and co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, last year reported observing child-bearing female orangutans chewing the leaves of the shrub Dracaena cantleyi to form a soapy foam that they then rub into their upper arms or legs. Chemical analysis showed it has anti-inflammatory properties. Local people use the same plant as pain relief. Unlike many other similarities between orangutans and humans, this one has cultural rather than evolutionary roots. And not in the way you might think. “When we surveyed local people,” says Morrogh-Bernard, “they told us their ancestors started using a number of plants as medicines after seeing orangutans doing so.”So our two species are very similar – to the extent that we sometimes even have things to learn from them.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

The funds cannot be used for party political purposes.In an email to the ERG last September, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) said the contents of a research note produced by the group last year amounted to political attacks on the Labour party for voting against the government’s European Union (withdrawal) bill.“Labour’s decision to vote against it is irresponsible, a breach of trust with their voters and a vote to create chaos,” said one of the passages in the briefing.The email last year to the ERG’s researcher, made public after a freedom of information request, said some of the group’s materials crossed the line into political campaigning and asked that this activity stop. Early this summer the watchdog wrote to the ERG again after a number of complaints, saying it wanted reassurance that public money was not being misspent on party political campaigning.The ERG receives taxpayer funds from MPs for its work as a “pooled service” providing research and briefings to MPs, and is not supposed to carry out political campaigning. But within the past week it has dramatically escalated its efforts to pressure the prime minister into abandoning her Chequers proposals as a basis for negotiating with the European Union.The group has reportedly drafted its own 140-page blueprint for an alternative to the prime minister’s negotiating position. The alternative manifesto was slated for launch this week as part of a concerted campaign to “chuck Chequers” and force the PM to make a U-turn or face a leadership challenge, until it was put on hold because of isions within the group.The ERG is officially one of five parliamentary pooled services that conduct research for each party. MPs can claim £2,000 a year each from public funds to cover the cost of this research, as long as the material they produce does not constitute party political campaigning.Fifty-three Conservative MPs have claimed subscription money from Ipsa for membership of the ERG since 2010, and the group has received around £340,000 in taxpayers’ money in that period. Its membership has fluctuated, with 90 MPs said to be on its WhatsApp group at various times. In response to last year’s Ipsa email, the ERG revealed that it operated a second bank account for receipt of private donations from benefactors in addition to its receipt of public money.“The non-Ipsa one pays for occasional functions, MPs’ breakfasts, drinks, etc. That’s it really,” it replied.The ERG has received multiple donations from private donors. Paul Dyer, a pro-Brexit businessman, donated £10,000 to the group in March 2017. Earlier in the year Steve Baker, until recently a Brexit minister, reported a donation of £6,500 in his capacity as ERG leader to pay for an event.That money was received from the Constitutional Research Council (CRC), a mysterious organisation of unknown membership said to be committed to pro-union causes. The CRC donated £435,000 to the Democratic Unionist party ahead of the Brexit referendum, part of which the party then paid to AggregateIQ, a little-known Canadian data consultancy also used in the referendum by Vote Leave.In 2014 the ERG’s then researcher, Robert Broadhurst, disclosed to parliament that his salary for working for the group was financed by private donations in addition to Ipsa funds. One donor was Norman Lamont, the pro-Brexit former chancellor of the exchequer.Lord Lamont said he could not recall the specifics of his donation but he remembered contributing “about £1,000” to Broadhurst’s salary. “I used to ring up Robert and ask him questions. I probably felt that it was wrong that I was not contributing, and MPs were,” he said.He agreed that the organisation had changed in recent years. “It has become more of a sort of campaigning thing,” Lamont said. “I supposed we all campaigned for certain things, but it did not have a collective policy. It largely consisted of having breakfast once a month and hearing from Robert Broadhurst, and making up our own minds.”An ERG spokesperson said: “We are strictly compliant with Ipsa rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e82d9189dc6703ae6f3f497ac9fb5e0d629f707/0_60_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bd7c1916ca1ca9ff7862ba4f9087b87","title":"cornwall and south devon originally belonged to europe","story":"Study reveals Britain acquired regions when struck by land bearing what is now FranceWith what can only be described as unfortunate timing, researchers have discovered that there is a corner of Britain that will forever belong to mainland Europe.Analysis of rock from deep beneath the ground reveals that the UK only acquired Cornwall and parts of south Devon when it was struck by the landmass bearing what is now France some hundreds of millions of years ago.Geologists at Plymouth University ran chemical tests on solidified magma that welled up long ago from a depth of 100km, to understand the makeup of the rock that underpins the south-west of the country. They found that a distinct compositional border ides Cornwall and south Devon from the rest of the nation.The tests show that the region of Britain to the south of Camelford and the Exe estuary lies on the same ancient landmass that sits under France and much of the rest of Europe, tying the southwestern tip of Britain to the continent for evermore.“When we started looking at the rocks it was very clear that there were two groups,” said Arjan Dijkstra, a lecturer in igneous petrology at Plymouth. “Only the rocks to the north were what we expected for Britain. To the south, they were identical to rocks found in France. The roots of these rocks are French to the minutest detail.”Dijkstra said the discovery means we have to rethink how the British Isles formed. Until now, geologists believed the isles came to be when two landmasses crashed together more than 400m years ago. The northernmost landmass, called Laurentia, bore what is modern-day Scotland, while the southernmost landmass, Avalonia, bore England and Wales.Researchers knew a third landmass, Armorica, was also involved about 100m years later, but this slab of European rock was thought to have crunched into Avalonia somewhere beneath the Channel. The latest tests show that the collision actually happened farther north, with parts of Armorica providing the geological foundations from Tavistock down to Penzance.Dijkstra now compares the formation of Britain to a rather messy three-way car crash. The first landmasses to collide were Avalonia and Laurentia, giving rise to what is now most of Britain. Armorica may then have crashed into Avalonia from the south, only to back away and leave the geological equivalent of its bumper behind. Later on, it advanced again, and crunched into the landmass once more.“This is a completely new way of thinking about how Britain was formed,” said Dijkstra. “It has always been presumed that the border of Avalonia and Armorica was beneath what would seem to be the natural boundary of the English Channel. But our findings suggest that although there is no physical line on the surface, there is a clear geological boundary that separates Cornwall and south Devon from the rest of the UK.”Working with his master’s student Callum Hatch, Dijkstra visited 22 sites across Devon and Cornwall where ancient volcanic eruptions had brought molten mantle from beneath Earth’s crust to the surface. The pair took rock samples from each of the sites and compared the chemical makeup with measurements taken from similar material across the UK and Europe.The findings, reported in the journal Nature Communications, go some way to explain why Cornwall and Devon have an abundance of tin and tungsten, metals found in Brittany and other areas of mainland Europe. “These minerals come from deep in the crust,” Dijkstra said.“We always knew that around 10,000 years ago you would have been able to walk from England to France. But our findings show that millions of years before that, the bonds between the two countries would have been even stronger. It explains the immense mineral wealth of south-west England, which had previously been something of a mystery, and provides a fascinating new insight into the geological history of the UK.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bristol beyond the blade podcast","story":"In the first episode of our new series, we hear from support workers in Bristol who talk about how role models, masculinity and intergenerational relationships are all key to tackling violent crime"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2e9fc6bed03d054b4b468b6b4813f0da65d77d1/288_154_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6daa25f41cf03785bb1754f5b2448749","title":"worcester cornell du preez unable to talk throat injury rugby","story":"Cornell du Preez, the Worcester and Scotland back-row, has revealed he is unable to talk and must remain in hospital for the next four weeks as a result of the serious throat injury he sustained on the opening weekend of the Premiership season.

Golovkin will put up the WBC and WBA belts, as well as the lesser IBO title, while Álvarez will climb in as the Ring magazine and lineal middleweight champion by virtue of a 2015 win over Miguel Cotto (albeit at a catchweight of 155lb). They are still the two finest operators in their ision and, some might argue, any other. But the cordiality and mutual respect that marked the build-up to their first encounter has been replaced by bitter discord.This time, as they say, it is personal. The Kazakh puncher known as Triple G, who had spent the better part of a decade ripping through the 160lb ision with an uncommon blend of patience, technique and powerin both hands, had been disillusioned enough by the scorecards that wrought the first blemish on his sterling professional record, most grievous among them Adalaide Byrd’s risible score of 118-110 in favor of Álvarez.Yet the discontent of Golovkin (38-0-1, 34 KOs) only redoubled in February after Álvarez failed a pair of Vada-administered urine screenings for the banned substance clenbuterol, which the Mexican claimed was a result of contaminated meat consumed while training in Guadalajara. The NAC slapped him with a backdated six-month suspension, prompting the cancellation of a big-money rematch that had come together in the immediate aftermath of their first fight – and the ire of the opponent he had left at the altar.“Come on, I told you, it’s not meat,” an annoyed Golovkin told a gaggle of reporters in March at his training camp in the California mountain hamlet of Big Bear Lake. “Canelo’s team are using these drugs and everybody’s trying to pretend it’s not happening.The ill will led to far more contentious negotiations for Saturday’s rematch, with Golovkin standing pat on his demand for a straight 50-50 ide of the purse and Álvarez, owing to a more established pay-per-view pedigree, calling for 65-35 in his favour. Deadlines came and went but once Golovkin accepted a 55-45 split, the fight was on – bad blood and all.Álvarez (49-1-2, 34 KOs) has not officially lost a fight since a 2013 points loss to Floyd Mayweather when he was 23, even if many believe Golovkin was the true winner of last year’s first instalment – a sentiment that could be plainly heard from the boos that cascaded down from the arena’s upper reaches after the decision was announced last year. Yet just because the red-haired counter-puncher from Guadalajara has been somewhat muted during the run-up to Saturday’s fight, eschewing a media tour and the standard HBO promotional trappings, doesn’t mean the anger doesn’t flow both ways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c9ef2cbb914047c2f9cc8b1ee8c62b5819b7e2/0_4_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a6323904ad5ab64ef8611a1604a6a1c 645w","title":"super 8s to be scrapped after clubs vote through restructuring changes rugby union","story":"The Super 8s are to be replaced with a conventional one-up, one-down structure between the Super League and the Championship after proposals to restructure domestic rugby league in time for the 2019 season were overwhelmingly approved at a extraordinary general meeting of the Rugby Football League and the sport’s professional clubs.Super League, led by chief executive, Robert Elstone, have been seeking to end the current Super 8s league format for some time. Opposition to that from a number of clubs outside of Super League led to the RFL calling an EGM in Salford on Friday for a final, decisive vote on the issue – and almost two-thirds of those in attendance voted to approve the changes, meaning this will be the last season of the current format.“The pressure is now on, rather than off,” said Elstone. “But it’s a good pressure, and a pressure I want. This now is the start of the job, and it’s about me backing up what I’m saying about where the game can go and how we need to present it. It’s down to action.“It shifts the accountability onto my team and I think everyone in the game will see a sharper focus on Super League - and I think from tomorrow, we’ll now see a leaner and more effective governing body. It’s good news on all levels. Now is the time for some action, and let’s see what we can do with our game.”The changes mean that the bottom side will be relegated from Super League after 29 regular-season fixtures, compared to the current Super 8s format where the bottom four teams are thrown into a new competition, the Qualifiers, with the Championship’s best teams to fight for survival. Super League will also introduce the return of a top-five play-off system to determine the champions as a result of the changes.Several clubs outside Super League had warned of a potentially disastrous situation for the lower leagues if the proposals were ratified, with only one side guaranteed promotion and purported financial uncertainty. The chief executive of the RFL, Ralph Rimmer, instead insisted that the changes should be seen as a positive for the whole sport“We’ve got a fairly intelligent group of people in there who understood that the proposal was the right thing for the game,” he said. “There’s a sense of relief because I think we’ve got a lot more positives in the sport the celebrate than the kind of discussions we’ve had in recent months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05c1accc0ef378396cd47086da4693c5b0c64bca/66_94_3341_2005/master/3341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f920514cea56e83a1e2ce704c3b20cd8","title":"talking horses magic wand obrien arc de triomphe longchamp horse racing tips","story":"Royal Ascot heroine can strike for the Irish trainer in key Arc de Triomphe trial at Longchamp on SundayThis weekend brings a hatful of Group One races and, although the final entries are not available for Sunday as I type, O’Brien looks likely to have more than 20 runners in top-class races over the next two days, in Britain, Ireland and France.\u0026nbspMagic Wand (2.50) is one that catches my eye, on offer at 4-1 for Sunday’s Prix Vermeille at Longchamp. You need to make a few excuses for her but she was found to have a dirty nose after her Irish Oaks flop and, in the context of what was happening at her yard, I think that’s enough to put a line through the form.She fared better at York last time but needs to be better again to win this. I believe we may see something like the Magic Wand of Royal Ascot, when she pounded four lengths clear of a horse who won a Group One next time.Crucially, she looks like getting a sound surface. The ground is reportedly good at Longchamp and the weather in Paris is supposed to get quite warm over the weekend. It could be the fastest ground yet encountered by the favourite, Kitesurf, and she might have trouble keeping tabs on Magic Wand if so.\u0026nbspI mention all this now because, what with the Leger and the Irish Champion on Saturday, there’s not going to be another chance to pore over Sunday’s races. I hope you all have an enjoyable weekend watching the action and don’t stray too far from a telly.Friday’s nap, at 5-1, is Misty Birnam (3.40), who made an absolutely extraordinary crash down the ratings this summer after arriving from South Africa via Ireland. The grey was dropped 22lb for three defeats in which he showed very little ability, and then showed quite a bit of it when scoring handily at Redcar after missing the break.I wouldn’t want him to miss the kick from trap three around Chester. Otherwise, he’s surely still well treated on a 7lb higher mark.At Doncaster, I fancy Ben Vrackie (3.00) in the Mallard, although his odds have been smashed up by a couple of influential tipsters and he’s just 7-2 now. This race has fallen to well-backed three-year-olds in each of the last two years and Ben Vrackie is one of only two runners from that age group, the other being Austrian School, who will probably go and win now.Earlier, the Flying Childers looks hot but 14-1 is too big about the progressive Well Done Fox (2.25), from the Hannon yard that has won this four times since 2010. Forcing tactics didn’t help him when he was down the field in the Molecomb and he did better when held up in touch at York last time. That was a lesser race but has been a good pointer to this one over the years.At 6-1, Saunter (3.35) is the one that appeals in the Doncaster Cup, in which he faces some ageing rivals whose best days are surely behind them. A smaller field and a deader surface than he met in the Ebor may help.\u0026nbspThere are each-way possibilities about 16-1 shot Knife Edge (3.55) at Sandown. Two years ago, he won the German 2,000 Guineas for Marco Botti, then disappeared to Hong Kong. He’s back with James Fanshawe and travelled nicely on his reappearance at Chelmsford before finding little. We might see a bit more this time, with the yard in fine form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cbe4ef3ad2c5d6a63978fb6524d0875ab24b6b4/480_696_3684_2210/master/3684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa69cd2f5f29b65b4835fd370036fa2c","title":"natalia osipova pure dance review","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonThe ballet superstar plots a course from classic to modern with six pieces that evoke eeriness, desolation and giddy joyMuch is made these days of ballet dancers being flexible. Not ankles-up-by-your-ears flexible – although that helps – but stylistically flexible. You train for years moulding your body to fit classical ballet’s narrow prescription, then spend the rest of your dancing life breaking out of it. Many dancers try contemporary rep, but Natalia Osipova is rare in pursuing concurrent careers at the top of world-leading ballet companies (Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre) and as her own artistic director, commissioning new work.The test is whether Osipova can convincingly shed her ballerina’s skin to inhabit these contemporary worlds. Across this evening of six works – four new commissions, one UK premiere and one “heritage” piece – the answer has to be yes: Osipova’s dancing looks freer and more expansive than I’ve seen it before.Pure Dance reunites Osipova with her favourite partner, David Hallberg, and he is a refined presence in Antony Tudor’s The Leaves Are Fading, from 1975. In fact these leaves are swirling, as if kicked up on the breeze, moving in continuous circles like the ribbon of a rhythmic gymnast. Coy half-smiles and sweet memories play on Osipova’s face as they dance with an oh-so-delicate touch.Part of becoming a chameleonic dancer is choosing great people to learn from. In Iván Pérez’s new work Flutter, it’s the brilliant Jonathan Goddard, a dancer whose seemingly boneless body takes on a joyous levity.Osipova can’t match Goddard’s utter naturalness but there’s great pleasure as the pair come repeatedly rushing forward to the edge of the stage, with giddy faces, in a manner that can only be described as gambolling.It’s in Roy Assaf’s Six Years Later (2011), dancing with Jason Kittelberger, that Osipova departs farthest from familiar turf. A mildly unnerving piece that manages to make Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata seem deeply eerie, it gives us a worn-in and perhaps worn-out relationship two people who know each other so well they fall together into dextrous phrases, perfectly in tune. Their slightly hunched bodies lean on and support each other, but they’re also frustrated, needling, Osipova batting her lover’s body with her shoulders in a futile argument that no one is winning.The depressing realism of this romantic cul-de-sac makes Alexei Ratmansky’s Valse Triste, a more balletic take on the rollercoaster of a relationship, look stagey by comparison – but it’s an interesting conjunction.Osipova ends with a solo, Ave Maria (set to Schubert) by the Japanese choreographer Yuka Oishi. The choice of music is almost trite, Osipova plays up to its emotion with full commitment, her panoply of facial expressions played to the back rows. There’s something about Osipova here reminiscent of a very different artist, the flamenco dancer Rocío Molina – the improvisatory feel, the awkward angles segueing into scrolling grace, the stubborn drive of her dancing.Like Molina, Osipova is seeking modes of expression beyond her classical roots, and proving herself a very 21st-century dancer.

At once, a satire of Hollywood culture (which is called “Hollywoo” after the D is stolen from the sign), BoJack Horseman is also a complex look at what it means to be happy and how the choices we make can have a profound impact on the happiness and wellbeing of others.The series’ insistence on probing existential anxiety at what it means to be a person (or horse or cat or any number of human-like animals that we encounter in BoJack’s colorful world) has earned the show a reputation for being particularly sad, despite also being a zany, offbeat comedy filled to the brim with sly humor. Certainly, many of BoJack’s most memorable and affecting moments come from the series’ insistence on not shying away from grief. Over the course of the show we encounter characters who try to make sense of personal trauma, and deal with both medical issues and mental health concerns in a world that is often vapid, celebrity-obsessed and indifferent to personal suffering.And yet, I think it’s too simplistic to suggest that BoJack Horseman’s appeal comes exclusively from the many ways that it explores sorrow. Instead, I’d argue that BoJack’s power comes from its brave insistence on accountability. Simply put, there is no other show on television today that holds characters as responsible for their failings as BoJack, and there is no other show that does so while also still insisting on the possibility that characters we know and love still have a chance at hope, renewal and change.This emphasis on personal responsibility has been a through-line since the first season when BoJack asks Diane how she felt about him after ghost-writing his tell-all memoir:“Do you think I’m a good person, deep down?” he asks her.“That’s the thing,” Diane tells him, “I don’t really believe in deep down. I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do.”Diane’s insistence that we can measure our kindness by very real actions is echoed in season three when we see Todd confronting BoJack: “You can’t keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it OK.” Later in that same conversation, when BoJack tries to excuse his actions, Todd goes on, “BoJack, just … stop. You are all the things that are wrong with you. It’s not the alcohol or the drugs or any of the shitty things that happened in your career or when you were a kid. It’s you, all right? It’s you.”The new season goes further in this interrogation of the ways our actions define us by looking directly at our societal obsession with male antiheroes and our continued fascination with and exoneration of famous men who do very bad things. Throughout this season, we see BoJack grapple with taking on a role for a TV series that seems to be inspired by his life (the set looks exactly like his very real house), while aspects of his constructed “antihero” character also seem to be seeping into his actual identity, while Diane, who is given the opportunity to become a writer on the series, grows sick with the realization that the bad behaviors she helped put on screen are now being romanticized by viewers.In many ways, the new episodes build on the emotional momentum that was established in the previous season, where we learned the backstory of BoJack’s abusive mother and how her own behaviors were shaped by childhood experiences that left her angry and traumatized. The show’s insistence on framing Beatrice Horseman’s narrative with tremendous nuance allowed us to see the horrors of child abuse and how familial trauma persists over generations, all the while showing how Beatrice is a woman (or horse-woman) whose very real despair clearly leads to her cruel and self-absorbed parenting style. Throughout the series, we see child BoJack, eager and wide-eyed in his little sailor suit, being verbally abused by his mother and father. But while the series encourages us to see BoJack’s own self-absorption as a response to a traumatic childhood, it also insists that BoJack not be given a free pass. In his heart of hearts, BoJack is never a “bad guy” per se, but his thoughtless choices often have very real impacts on everyone around him.Is it possible for a show about accountability to be as edgy as a show about the seedy allure of moral failure? For years now, the antihero saga has been the mainstay in prestige TV and dramas and there has been an overwhelming assumption that shows centering on the lives of good, earnest people are simply not as sexy. And yet, at its heart, season five shows how our love of bad behavior for its own sake has actually become kind of boring. Perhaps this is especially true in a world where kindness and compassion are often denigrated as being weak, and where “niceness” is often decried as merely bland and uninteresting. In contrast, BoJack Horseman’s greatest strength is its insistence that the work involved in doing the right thing is actually pretty compelling in its own right. It helps that the show’s clever animation and off-the-wall humor (one of the subplots of this season features a sex robot that blares “erotic” phrases at inopportune moments) is always genuinely funny.In one moving scene in the new season, BoJack reflects on how there is never going to be a happy ending in real life because the story – and, by extension, our stories – simply keep going. In the same way, the series, which I hope will be picked up for many more seasons, is less interested in providing a linear framework for understanding trauma, than in exploring what we do with the things we inherit. In this way, BoJack Horseman is the opposite of a sad show – it declares over and over again that each of us has the potential to grow, be better, change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71ac73c4a185b3e4818e65e15baa8c46b1a1a9f/1594_0_2656_1595/master/2656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c29d1ad0fe1f472cca79450387e18b5","title":"brexit worries from the irish border a panoramic photo essay","story":"Amid the growing tensions over Brexit and the border, photojournalist Charles McQuillan met people whose work takes them across the frontier. Many expressed fears about the future and the possible return of old isionsCharles McQuillan, a freelance photographer with the news agency Getty Images, used a panoramic film camera to shoot these images. He then built a darkroom in his garage to process the films. He says: “The most problematic issue with photographing the border is that there is nothing there to photograph. With that as a starting point, the basic concept for the picture essay was to show that uninterrupted space, and to include people who have a direct relationship with the border. And, more broadly, to show them in the landscape with the expanse of the open countryside around them and their place in it. The nothingness of it.“One of the privileges that comes with being a photographer is that it allows you access to people you would not necessarily meet, and it was difficult not to be moved by Betty, Eamonn, John, Brian, Emma, Johnny, Vincent, William and Catriona as I listened to their concerns about Brexit. Each of the subjects photographed were grateful for being allowed a voice, something many people in the province feel they no longer have.“My own memories of the border and the checkpoints are somewhat distant, but I can recall sitting on the back seat of my mother and father’s car wondering whether the raised hand of the guard would either beckon onwards or to stop. The mundaneness of the various checkpoints across the north, the armed soldier with his weapon trained on the car, all seem to have merged into one memory now. When stopped at the border, the question to my father was always the same: ‘Where are you coming from, sir, and where are you going?’ I can’t remember my father ever declaring anything.”Catriona attends nearby St Mary’s college in Derry. Her journey to and from school threads through the border.She says: “Ireland’s economy cannot afford to make the border anything more than it already is today – an invisible line that separates the country. At most, we will have checkpoints which will take a great step back into the past of Northern Ireland. My biggest fear is that it will damage my future education through travelling to university, affecting my pathway of study.”Farmer and landowner, Florence CourtThe popular boardwalk on the farmer’s land allows thousands of tourists to walk across the border every year as it meanders between County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland and County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland.A member of the Border Communities Against Brexit group, Sheridan predicts the UK will lose much of its wealth and status after Brexit. He says: “There is no such thing as a soft border. Over time, it will become a hard border by layer upon layer of legislation. The only practical solution I can see is to have the border in the Irish Sea.”Vice-chair of Newry Chamber of Commerce and TradeMarmion, who has two young children, owns a human resources business with offices and employees in Newry in the north and Dundalk in the south. She recalls recently explaining to her eldest child, while they were riding their bikes, that she was unable to use the road they were cycling on when she was young because of concrete blockades placed there by the British army. She says she has no idea what the border will look like after Brexit. “That’s the scary part – nobody knows. My greatest hope is that it would be ision-less and prosperous, not just for business and trade but for the navigation of everyday life.”When asked what concerns her most, Marmion says: “That the border would look like it did when I was growing up: restrictive and fearsome. Absent of both the freedom of movement and unlocked opportunity that my children deserve – and that I have enjoyed since 1998.”McKeegan crosses the border several times a week as he attends to the recently deceased from both sides of the frontier. He says: “If the politicians were children you would give them a smack and tell them to get their heads together to sort it out. There’s no reason in the world that they can’t come to some common-sense agreement. In relation to my sensitive line of work, can you imagine waiting in a queue at the border with family sitting in cars behind you as you carry their loved ones home? It’s undignified. You just can’t close the border off with a brick wall and red tape.”Holmes is a member of Donegal Action for Cancer Care, which is based in the Republic of Ireland but has access to nearby health facilities in the north. Without access to the new radiotherapy unit in Derry, which the Irish government invested in, cancer patients in Donegal face a five-hour journey to Galway.When asked what she thinks the border will look like post-Brexit, Holmes says: “There will be a serious ision of people who have lived and worked closely together for many peaceful years. Long queues, angry people, loss of jobs, missed appointments, flights and a younger generation who can’t understand why. They will now bere introduced to a time when hate and bigotry were rife and the possible return of paramilitaries. My greatest fear after Brexit is the serious loss of access to cancer services for Donegal patients at Altnagelvin Area hospital in Derry. Without these patients, the North West Cancer Centre will not have the critical mass to sustain the services needed for cancer patients in Derry and the surrounding areas.”McKevitt recalls how, in his youth, IRA snipers would shoot at the customs post from the hills, pictured behind him. He was sent by his parents to the US to avoid getting caught up in the violence that engulfed the province. His fireworks, gardening and fuel business sits on the land the former customs post used to occupy.He says he has many concerns about Brexit. “My greatest fear is of the government taking my land away with the return of the customs post. I’ve built up all of this and worked hard, what would I do then?”As a business owner whose oyster farm straddles both sides of the border, Lynch will be particularly affected after Brexit. He faces tariffs to ship his oysters outside of the UK to nearby Donegal, and indeed the rest of the Europe. He says: “I worry that we will return to the bad old days. I remember the border growing up as a child quite vividly, and I remember the two customs posts sat only a few yards apart from each other, and that you couldn’t cross the border after 10pm without special written permission from the guards.” To further complicate matters, the UK government claims jurisdiction over Lough Foyle to the high-tide mark, while the Irish government disputes this.Clifford, who lives in the Republic of Ireland, owns a fast food stand that trades along the border to lorry drivers transporting goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.He says: “I don’t know what’s going to happen after Brexit, no one does. My biggest fear is that I will lose my job, my livelihood, everything – and that, at the finish of it, the Troubles will come back.”Kilkeel is home to Northern Ireland’s largest fishing fleet. Cunningham is concerned that could soon change. He says: “My biggest fear is displacement of fishing effort. We traditionally fished in the bay of Dundalk, a few miles along the coast, but we’ll no longer be allowed in there. It’s a disaster for the inshore fishing fleet.“There are 40 small boats in Kilkeel harbour that seek shelter through the winter from the prevailing south-west winds. When Brexit happens, where will they go? Small boats exposed 12 miles out to sea, that’s life or death stuff. That’s not bullshit, that’s reality.”McQuillan says: “The portraits could have been shot digitally and much more simply with a wide-angle lens. However, the perspective would have become warped. Whereas a panoramic camera avoids curvature if positioned correctly, offers less distortion and is much truer to the eye with its even horizon and straight lines. Shooting film again for the first time in almost 20 years would also give the photographs a different look and feel to modern digital cameras, with the colours saturated and borrowed from a different time. However, the film came at a premium, with the size of the panoramic negative only permitting four exposures per roll.“The panoramic cameras, a Fuji GX617 and a Noblex u150, brought unique challenges. Focus could only be accurately accomplished with the aid of a tape measure. Flash could not be synced to the Noblex because of its rotating drum lens. To further complicate matters, fingers placed incorrectly when holding the camera would fall into frame if not careful. This was something that only became apparent when I was confronted with the negatives in the darkroom, which I built in a corner of the garage to iron out the camera’s idiosyncrasies and quirks. The only downside to shooting on panoramic format was having to go back to what once seemed a full-frame digital camera. I found that the view was much more restricted than had appeared before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f576c0bc88a96344c216354a846661f6d39b4a1/0_139_5242_3145/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ef9de21d560157adc9b8750d86ae066","title":"sweden remains in political limbo after all votes counted","story":"One-seat margin separates two established blocs, with far right waiting in the wingsSweden’s ruling centre-left bloc holds just one more parliamentary seat than its centre-right rival, election authorities said, with all votes now counted after an election that has left the country in political deadlock and facing weeks, if not months, of talks to form a new government.Stefan Löfven, the Social Democrat prime minister, rejected a demand from Ulf Kristersson, the Moderate party leader, to step aside and help the centre-right alliance form a viable government, saying it would be “illogical” for the larger bloc to facilitate an Alliance government. “You can discount that idea absolutely,” Löfven said.But Kristersson, the centre-right’s candidate for the premiership, said it was “natural” for the Alliance to now seek a mandate to build a government. “We want the government to respect the result and resign,” he told a news conference.The Christian Democrat leader, Ebba Busch Thor, said “the Alliance is the government alternative that is clearly larger than the Social Democrats, and clearly larger than the current government” of the Social Democrats and Greens. Löfven, however, is counting the former communist Left party, which backed the outgoing coalition in parliament, as part of his centre-left bloc.The prime minister had earlier said he believed the election result marked the end of Sweden’s traditional system of political blocs, which has been severely destabilised by the steady rise of the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats.He wants to form some kind of coalition or cross-bloc deal with the smaller Centre and Liberal parties but both have so far indicated they would prefer to stick within their bloc, aware that splitting the Alliance could condemn the centre right to years in opposition or as minority members of Social Democrat-led governments.A “grand coalition” of the Social Democrats and Moderates could also lend credence to the Sweden Democrats’ claim to be the only true opposition. The other parties are so far holding to their pledge not to negotiate with the far-right party, which has promised to use its parliamentary votes to sink any government that does not give it a say over policy, particularly on immigration.“Our enemies have really forced us into a life-and-death struggle for our culture and our nation’s survival,” Mattias Karlsson, the Sweden Democrats’ parliamentary group leader and chief ideologue, wrote on his Facebook page. “There are only two choices: victory or death.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b8053d6b0102ec10640d9cf81419b99eb8f176/288_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff1a723f7dcd9099c44654113f30ae5b","title":"techno fest in ship graveyard aims to revive vanished aral sea","story":"Uzbek electronica jamboree seeks to lure waters back to parched sea bedThey’ve tried dams, dykes and dialogue over the years in vain attempts to reverse one of the world’s most stunning environmental disasters – the near-total disappearance of a sea that was once the size of Ireland.So it’s time for a different approach. On Friday, the deserted, dried-out bed of the Aral Sea in a remote part of Central Asia will echo to the sound of an electronic music festival, as activists try to raise awareness of the catastrophe, and put the sea back on the map, figuratively, if not literally.Visitors to Moynaq, a forlorn Uzbek town, are usually disaster tourists coming to gawk at the desolation of the apocalyptic landscape, where the carcasses of ships rot on sand once covered by the world’s fourth-largest lake.But this week, revellers have been descending for the festival of electronic, techno, avant-garde and dance music. DJs from Moscow and Berlin will mix music “that teleports you mentally to other places”, organiser Otabek Suleimanov enthused. It will very possibly be the first electronica festival to be held in a ship graveyard.“It’s great!” said Farukh Sharipov, a 25-year-old graphic designer standing on the quay on Thursday under the burning sun, seeking a spot to pitch his tent after flying in from the capital Tashkent and driving two hours across the desert to Moynaq.“The whole world should know about the Aral catastrophe … Not everyone pays attention to an ecological catastrophe, but if we come here to party then people will come and start taking an interest.”A lawyer who moonlights as a DJ, Suleimanov dreamt up this quixotic event to draw attention to the plight of the Aral Sea, which has shrunk to a tenth of its original size because of shortsighted Soviet policies.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIntense cotton farming that erted feeder rivers for irrigation has been blamed for the recession of the sea in the late Soviet period. The waters left behind a toxic, salt-encrusted, pesticide-poisoned land that poses a serious environmental and health hazard.The music for the festival will be pumped out beside a former lighthouse in Moynaq, a once thriving fishing port left high and dry when the waters disappeared from the town in the 1980s.Organisers are predicting a turnout of a few hundred hardcore fun-seekers – but although they are starting small, they have big ambitions: they hope the festival, which is free of charge, will become an annual event. In their wildest dreams, one day it will turn into a central Asian version of the Nevada desert’s Burning Man.That may be a pipe dream, but locals including hotelier Mahmud Akbarov are excited anyway. “This is wonderful!” he said. “More events like this should be held, to attract people here.”There are no big names playing, but there are some interesting acts – DJs include Orgatanatos, an Uzbek project producing “ambient, glitchcore, noise and other experimental styles” and Interchain, a Moscow punk-techno duo.The festival’s name evokes its environmental aspirations: Stihia, a Russian word loosely translating as “the elements” but with connotations of something “unstoppable”, Suleimanov told the  – like the drying up of the Aral, which split into two parts in the 1980s.Its northern part in Kazakhstan has been rejuvenated by a dam, but the southern Uzbek section is in a dire state: in drier years, it is just a narrow strip of water on the western side.Stihia has a mystical element as well as a pragmatic one: Suleimanov sees the music-makers as akin to the rainmakers of the area’s ancient nomadic tribes, although “rainmakers were using drums, and we’re using electronic music to call the sea back”.On Thursday afternoon, gazing out over the former seabed as he waited for the sound systems to trundle across the desert from Nukus, his main concern was that those making the trip to Moynak should have a good time. “It’s all about the aftertaste – how people feel when they leave.”Stihia looks set to rock not just Moynak but all Uzbekistan, a predominantly Muslim country of 34 million people that until recently was known as one of the world’s worst police states.Since long-ruling dictator Islam Karimov died in 2016, his successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been experimenting with a thaw often dubbed the “Uzbek Spring”.Under Karimov, Uzbekistan was a buttoned-up conservative state that frowned upon fun, discouraging everything from rap music to Valentine’s Day celebrations.Official backing for Stihia is a sign of the changing times – and Suleimanov believes the festival will send out some positive vibes about Uzbekistan by “telling the world: look, guys, things are changing – and if the government is supporting such a crazy idea as having electronic music in the middle of a desert, then you can trust that at least something is going well!”.The idea would have seemed “shocking” not long ago, said Sharipov with a chuckle. “Now this is kind of normal, because our society is becoming more open. People can just have fun, without being afraid of anyone.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

It said some products allegedly were off-loaded from Russian ships.At the end of August, Russia blocked publication of the report because it disagreed with the findings. Agence France-Presse reported that diplomatic sources at that time also said Russia blocked a US request that two Russian shipping companies and six of their vessels be sanctioned over oil shipments to the North.“Russia can’t be allowed to edit and obstruct independent UN reports on North Korea sanctions just because they don’t like what they say,” Haley said.“This is a dangerous precedent and a stain on the important work of the panel,” Haley said, calling for the initial version of the report – dating from early August – to be published.The news came as the US sanctioned a Chinese technology firm and its Russian sister company, saying they are both controlled by North Koreans and provide revenue to Pyongyang. It comes as the US is redoubling efforts to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.“These actions are intended to stop the flow of illicit revenue to North Korea from overseas information technology workers disguising their true identities and hiding behind front companies, aliases, and third-party nationals,” treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The US in July had demanded without success an end to all oil exports to North Korea, citing satellite photographs and expert reports to claim illegal ship-to-ship transfers had allowed Pyongyang to evade sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.In its original report the UN panel included the names of Russian ships and entities that had contravened UN sanctions, opening the way for international measures against them.Russia “obtained the removal of the main part of the paragraphs” concerning it, a diplomat said, speaking anonymously.“The sanctions committee gave in,” a move raising questions about its independence, he said.By blocking since early August release of the original document, Russia explained that the report relied mainly on American information and did not take into account a Russian analysis of the application of sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d4d98f92b0cd54ac604bdd63585e45a52a2fe2/0_19_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8659ed267eeb4d96a7184ce4c6f121e7","title":"florence hurricane latest live news updates weather path storm surge north carolina","story":"More than 300,000 people without power as ‘life-threatening’ storm lashes US central seaboard with damaging winds and storm surge Even though it leaves you exposed to the elements, experts say that people caught in flood emergencies are safer on the roof than in attics or crawlspaces, where they can more easily become trapped.With Florence moving at a snail’s pace of 5mph, we’re still waiting to feel the force of the storm here in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Nonetheless, the rain and wind is lashing at my hotel window with reports of minor damage to property a little further up the road. The centre is only around 65 miles away, but we’re going to be waiting until after midday before it crosses the state line down into South Carolina. By around that time we’re expecting wind gusts of around 65mph.

Check out these stunning images from German astronaut Alexander Gerst looking down on Florence’s eye from the International Space Station.Donald Trump’s Twitter is, for the moment, all business as it relates to Hurricane Florence.Earlier this week Trump responded to discussions about Florence and the administration’s response to storms last year to falsely claim that studies on the death toll from Hurricane Maria were inflated by Democrats to make him look bad.62 people, including an infant and many children were safely relocated from a hotel in Jacksonville, North Carolina after officials found potentially fatal structural damage to the building.About 12:45 AM, Jacksonville 9-1-1 received a call about damage to the Triangle Motor Inn at 246 Wilmington Hwy. A basketball sized hole was found in a corner room by an Officer. Firefighters later found life-threatening damage to the structure. Cinder blocks that were part of the structure were crumbling in some places and residents were still in many of the rooms.Hurricane force winds were a challenge, and Police and Fire had to force their way into some rooms.Portions of the roof were collapsed, allowing rain to flood some of the rooms.Using a host of vehicles, Jacksonville Fire and Emergency Services transported many residents of the facility. Some drove their own vehicles with police escorts.The occupants have been placed in a temporary space in the Center for Public Safety while work is underway to find shelter for the residents.The latest update from the National Weather Service says maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph with higher gusts. It predicts a gradual weakening later today and tonight. Other notable observations:Track: “The center of Florence will move further inland across extreme southeastern North Carolina and extreme eastern South Carolina today and Saturday. Florence will then move generally northward across the western Carolinas and the central Appalachian Mountains early next week.”Storm Surge: The water has the potential to reach 7-11 ft from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout with locally higher amounts.Rainfall: For Southeastern coastal North Carolina into far northeastern South Carolina, an additional 20 to 25 inches, with isolated storm totals of 30 to 40 inches. For the remainder of South Carolina and North Carolina into southwest Virginia...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.Tornados: A few tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina today.One thing to remember with large tropical events like Florence is that they are typically multi-stage flooding events. The initial storm surge and rainfall flooding is often followed by swelling rivers and streams in the days ahead as inland inundation eventually finds its way to the lowest ground. In North Carolina, Cape Fear River now is predicted to experience record flooding Monday or Tuesday, long after Florence has passed over.Wilmington has recorded a wind gust of 105 mph, its highest in 60 years and second highest ever observed.Khushbu Shah is in Wilmington where Florence’s powerful eye wall is making landfall.She says windows are rattling and rain is pounding in 2-3 minute increments at the hotel windows.

Mr Duffy, an Independent candidate, was speaking after Waterford City and County Council voted to place him on the ballot paper, adding to the endorsements he had already received from councils in Carlow, Wicklow and Meath. He joins Senator Joan Freeman, Sean Gallagher, president Michael D Higgins and a Sinn Féin candidate in the election while a number of councils have yet to vote on the matter and may yield more nominees. Five hopefuls addressed the council in Dungarvan on Friday morning, including Mr Gallagher, who had already secured his nomination and asked members not to put him forward for another endorsement. Four other candidates had spoken to the council when they met in July. The only other candidate to be proposed and seconded in Waterford was journalist and campaigner Gemma O’Doherty, who was backed by Independent councillors Sean Reinhardt and Joe Kelly. Sinn Féin’s Cllr John Hearne abstained and there were some absentees. Immediately after the vote, Mr Duffy said: “One one level I am so relieved to have crossed the line in achieving the nomination. I am also very humbled to get that support, from right across the chamber.” He said now that he has the required four council endorsements, he will not be asking any other council for support and will instead be asking the to back a different candidate. “I have spoken to about 450 councillors around the country and the amount of work, effort and time that you put in — I think it’s a shame it’s a secret to the broader world out there, the amount of work you do,” he said.Earlier, the members were addressed by another former “Dragon,” Peter Casey, as well as Ms O’Doherty, Sarah Louise Mulligan, and Newry-based businessman John O’Hare, who only entered the race on Thursday. Ms O’Doherty told the councillors she was seeking a nomination, “in the furtherance of my desire to serve the cause of truth, justice and integrity for, and on behalf of, the Irish people.” She said the country is suffering from a culture of “corruption and clientelism, which is having a deeply damaging effect on democracy and on the relationship between the politicians and citizens.”Ms O’Doherty highlighted issues including housing, healthcare, a free press, and corruption as ones that are important to her.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesAs MPs left Westminster on Thursday for a three-week recess to attend their party conferences, Theresa May’s allies had an unexpected spring in their step. The prime minister’s Brexiteer critics in the European Research Group (ERG) were looking foolish after their leaders distanced themselves from a few dozen members who publicly plotted against May on Tuesday night.The ERG’s image as a highly disciplined machine had already taken a hit when it cancelled plans to publish its own blueprint for Brexit amid disagreements over its contents. Some members had apparently suggested including proposals for a missile defence shield and for a rapid response expeditionary force to protect the Falkland islands.The ERG went ahead on Wednesday with the publication of a paper on the Border, launching it in the splendid library of the Royal United Services Institute on Whitehall. The paper had been eagerly anticipated amid a swirl of rumours that the ERG was preparing to back a bold move to resolve the dispute between London and Brussels over the Border backstop.When the Commons Brexit committee, including ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg, visited Brussels last week Michel Barnier told them how he wanted to “de-dramatise” the backstop.“We need the necessary controls but we don’t want in any way to undermine the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom. We need to look at the inidual controls that are necessary,” he told the MPs.“We need to see how and when and where these controls would take place. They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland. They could be done using technological means.”Downing Street rejected the idea of carrying out checks at British ports on goods going to Northern Ireland, prompting Stewart Jackson, David Davis’s former chief of staff, to tweet:“So @10DowningStreet is now actively impeding the EU in trying to find a solution to the Northern Ireland border problem in order to unlock a #CanadaPlus FTA? Unbelievable.”Instead of embracing the de-dramatised backstop, however, the ERG’s Brexiteers lost their nerve and produced a paper full of warmed-up proposals for technological and administrative fixes for the Border.Downing Street was taken by surprise by the ERG’s loss of nerve, revealing that if May had been asked about the paper during prime minister’s questions, she would have said that “we don’t believe that the answer is to move the Border” – something the ERG did not, in the end, suggest.A few hours later, a senior cabinet minister told me the government was united in its opposition to the EU’s version of the backstop, even in its de-dramatised form.“This is not just the DUP, it’s the Conservative Party, Remainers as well as Brexiteers. We can’t have Northern Ireland in a separate customs territory to the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said.British negotiators have yet to propose an alternative to the EU’s backstop text in the draft withdrawal agreement and they have been dragging their feet about providing Barnier with information about trade flows and current checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The Conservatives may be committed to what May likes to call “our precious union” but the unresolved issue of the Border serves another purpose in the negotiations. It remains a strong argument against the Canada-style free trade agreement favoured by the Brexiteers and could serve as a lever to persuade the EU to bend their rules on the single market and customs union to Britain’s advantage.British ministers believe that if Dublin doesn’t blink when confronted with the cost of a no-deal Brexit to Ireland, the other EU member states may agree to move final resolution of the Border issue from the withdrawal agreement into the negotiation of the future relationship. If it is still unresolved after Britain leaves the EU next March, the Border could become more useful still to Britain as it negotiates the terms of its future trading relationship with Europe.The idea of “la perfide Albion” is deeply engrained in the European political consciousness, summed up brutally by Charles de Gaulle in his memoirs:“Pour l’Angleterre ... il n’y a pas d’alliance qui tienne, ni de traité qui vaille, ni le vérité qui compte.” (For England, there is no alliance that holds, no treaty which is respected, no truth which matters.)Few of today’s European leaders would speak so harshly of their British interlocutors but as the negotiations approach their endgame, they won’t be taking any chances either.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It also set up a livestream ready for the event.Mr Musk offered a hint to the identity of the customer, displaying a Japanese flag in a tweet sent in response to speculation that the company founder would be the first passenger.The announcement is reminiscent of plans announced last year to send two passengers around the Moon using the company’s Falcon Heavy rocket to blast them into space. They would have ridden in a Dragon crew vehicle that SpaceX routinely sends loaded with supplies to the International Space Station.However, the project was apparently shelved after Mr Musk admitted that the company was still working out whether it would be better achieved with the BFR.The names of those two tourists - and how much they intended to pay - were never revealed.Mr Musk\u0027s hopes of one day flying to Mars rest with the BFR, which he hopes will be ready to blast off for the red planet in 2022, and its associated BFS space craft.The reusable rocket will have 31 main Raptor engines and the thrust to launch 150 tons of cargo to Mars.The tech entrepreneur says the BFR will eventually replace SpaceX\u0027s existing lineup of rockets, which are currently used for missions such as delivering supplies to the International Space Station.However, Mr Musk has also proposed using the vehicle for point-to-point journeys around the Earth, travelling from New York to London in 29 minutes, for example.Commuters complain they are being \u0026#39held to ransom\u0026#39 after train firm keeps 10 per cent of cash from lost walletsSouth Korea launches its first missile-capable submarine despite thaw with NorthLabour will reject any Brexit deal based on Theresa May\u0026#39s Chequers plan, confirms Emily ThornberryComment: This just confirms Putin\u0026#39s regime has absolutely no connection with truthHalf a world away: how The Royle Family baffled the BBC but touched the nationNo armed officers present to protect murdered PC during Westminster terror attack, inquest hears\u0026#39Venom highs\u0026#39: men in India get deadly snakes to bite their tongues for a buzzRevealed: The cheapest destinations for a long-haul holidayChurchgoer, 88, becomes Britain\u0026#39s oldest stalker after falling for younger woman after bonding over BibleThousands of prison officers expected to stage walkout as ministers seek injunction to stop \u0026#39irresponsible\u0026#39 strikeThese charts show extent of the violence prison staff faceSkripal suspects\u0026#39 interviewer hangs up on BBC after being accused of peddling Russian \u0026#39propaganda\u0026#39Future of Europe: is the EU\u0026#39s dream of expansion to the east dead?Russia\u0026#39s \u0026#39tourists\u0026#39 denial over Salisbury insults our intelligence, says Theresa MayMark Carney accused of spreading \u0026#39gloom\u0026#39 with no-deal Brexit prediction of 35pc house price crashHurricane Florence reaches the Carolinas as officials warn \u0026#39disaster is at the doorstep\u0026#39 - track the storm\u0026#39s path liveShocking moment a speeding van \u0026#39flies\u0026#39 into the air during roundabout crashTheresa May should quit after Brexit and hand over to a \u0026#39new generation leader\u0026#39, says senior Tory MPWho Wants to be a Millionaire? to return in 2019 with Jeremy ClarksonJustin Welby\u0026#39s bishops offer zero-hours jobs that Archbishop of Canterbury called \u0026#39evil\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit interest rate rise mark carney bank of england","story":"Created with Sketch.The governor suggested that, unlike after the referendum vote, rates may need to rise to curb inflationClick to followThe IndependentThe Governor said Brexit is the \u0027most significant\u0027 influence on the UK’s economic outlook and that the Bank’s job is to \u0027plan for the worst\u0027No-deal Brexit may force interest rate rise, says Bank of England governor Mark CarneyMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has suggested that interest rates may need to rise, rather than fall, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.In a speech in Ireland, he said Brexit is the “most significant” influence on the UK’s economic outlook and that the Bank’s job is to “plan for the worst”.No-deal could lead to financial crisis as bad as 2008, warns CarneyEurostar ‘will not run’ if there is a no-deal BrexitUK-made cars will not be ‘valid for sale’ in EU after no-deal BrexitThe governor had previously seemed to suggest that a no-deal Brexit could result in a rate cut to support the economy by making borrowing cheaper, as occurred after the Brexit referendum in 2016.But according to reports of a briefing that Mr Carney gave to the cabinet on Thursday, he fears that such a rupture with the EU could represent a severe “contraction of supply” capacity in the UK economy. This could mean\u0026nbspthat inflation would be in danger of getting out of hand without early rate rises, particularly if sterling plummeted again, pushing up domestic import prices.At that briefing, the governor also pointed to the results of last year’s banking stress tests that were judged by the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee of regulators to include the worst case scenario from a no-deal Brexit. This included a 33 per cent decline in house prices, relative to otherwise, over three years.It also modelled the impact of a rise in interest rates to 4 per cent.That would significantly increase the pressure on mortgage borrowers and raise the cost of finance for business borrowers.Interest rates currently stand at 0.75 per cent, the highest since the financial crisis, after the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\u0026nbspraised them again in August.Financial markets are currently expecting just one further hike by the end of next year.A rise in rates to 3 per cent would add about £300 to the monthly repayments of someone with a £200,000 25-year repayment mortgage.The government’s own internal\u0026nbspforecasts suggest a long-term hit to the UK economy of failing to conclude a free-trade deal with the EU amounting to 8\u0026nbspper cent of GDP. That implies a fall in productivity growth capacity due to weaker trade with the largest and nearest commercial partners.But many analysts warn the industrial and travel chaos likely to be unleashed by a no-deal scenario would also hit short-term demand, risking a recession –\u0026nbspsomething that would ordinarily prompt a rate cut by a central bank.The decision to raise or cut rates after a chaotic Brexit would not be made by Mr Carney alone – it is the nine-person MPC\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspwould decide.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”Amal\u0026nbspClooney\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeoffrey Robertson over the Elgin Marbles (Getty)The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”AFPGetty)Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

This could mean\u0026nbspthat inflation would be in danger of getting out of hand without early rate rises, particularly if sterling plummeted again, pushing up domestic import prices.At that briefing, the governor also pointed to the results of last year’s banking stress tests that were judged by the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee of regulators to include the worst case scenario from a no-deal Brexit. This included a 33 per cent decline in house prices, relative to otherwise, over three years.It also modelled the impact of a rise in interest rates to 4 per cent.That would significantly increase the pressure on mortgage borrowers and raise the cost of finance for business borrowers.Interest rates currently stand at 0.75 per cent, the highest since the financial crisis, after the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\u0026nbspraised them again in August.Financial markets are currently expecting just one further hike by the end of next year.A rise in rates to 3 per cent would add about £300 to the monthly repayments of someone with a £200,000 25-year repayment mortgage.The government’s own internal\u0026nbspforecasts suggest a long-term hit to the UK economy of failing to conclude a free-trade deal with the EU amounting to 8\u0026nbspper cent of GDP. That implies a fall in productivity growth capacity due to weaker trade with the largest and nearest commercial partners.But many analysts warn the industrial and travel chaos likely to be unleashed by a no-deal scenario would also hit short-term demand, risking a recession –\u0026nbspsomething that would ordinarily prompt a rate cut by a central bank.The decision to raise or cut rates after a chaotic Brexit would not be made by Mr Carney alone – it is the nine-person MPC\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspwould decide. But the governor’s view is generally held to hold significant sway in its meetings.Mr Carney had been due to step down at the Bank of England in June 2019.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower.

Initially, authorities suggested the hole had been caused by space debris – but that conclusion appears to have been largely rejected, amid suggestions that it was in fact done by a human, either on Earth or in space.Since then, speculation has been rife about how the hole came to have been made and whether it could indicate any more general problems for the crew on board the space station. The issue was found in part of the spacecraft that also includes the capsule that will carry the astronauts back down to Earth.The mystery has led to conspiracy theories including a fast-spreading and baseless story that Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts drilled a hole in the space station to force the evacuation of a sick crew member.The bosses of Roscosmos and Nasa met to discuss the strange incident and agreed they would work together to find the cause of the leak. But any conclusions would not be shared until there is a final resolution, Nasa said.“The Administrator and the General Director noted speculations circulating in the media regarding the possible cause of the incident and agreed on deferring any preliminary conclusions and providing any explanations until the final investigation has been completed, Nasa said in a statement.“They affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation. They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.The commander of the International Space Station said that it was a shame and somewhat embarrassing that people were suggesting the crew might have had something to do with the hole.I can unequivocally say that the crew had nothing do with this, astronaut Drew Feustel\u0026nbspsaid during a space-to-ground interview with ABC News.

The aim of the plan was to allow frictionless trade to continue between the EU and UK after Brexit.If you leave the Union, you are of course no longer part of our single market, and certainly not only in the parts of it you choose.Mr Juncker\u0026nbspdescribed the conduct of his chief negotiator Michel Barnier as “masterful” and reiterated that the official\u0026nbsphad the “unanimous” support of EU member states – who Britain has tried to split off in order to get a better deal, so far unsuccessfully.\u0026nbspThe president’s rejection, which echoes the position of Mr Barnier and diplomats from\u0026nbspmember states, could raise the prospect of\u0026nbspBritain exiting without a deal, because UK government ministers have been clear that they view the choice in talks as one between Chequers and\u0026nbspno deal.Elsewhere in his wide-ranging speech, Mr Juncker, whose term ends after the next European elections in spring 2019, said the EU could easily “impose its position on others” when it spoke with one voice.“When we are united we Europeans, as a union, have become a force to be reckoned with that you cannot do without. Some in Europe were unhappy with the agreement that I reached with President Trump. Some were surprised by it, but there shouldn’t have been a surprise. Whenever Europe speaks as one, we can impose our position on others. Where necessary, Europe must act as one,” he said.‘Poor quality’ Brexit plans at key department risks billions of poundsUK will reject any EU offer of a ‘blind Brexit’, says HammondMay’s Brexit plan ‘substantially worse’ than status quo, says JohnsonThird of UK export firms have already lost business due to BrexitIn what might be interpreted as a veiled dig at British plans to set up its own satellite system after it leaves the EU, Mr Juncker said: “No single member state would’ve been able to launch the satellites that 400 million users around the world are already benefiting from. No member state could have done that on its own.”Elsewhere in the speech Mr\u0026nbspJuncker\u0026nbspsaid his commission would bring forward new rules to ensure elections free from third-party interference, and outlined plans for enhanced trade between the EU and Africa.He also suggested reforms to the EU’s governance structures,\u0026nbspscrapping the requirement for unanimous European Council votes on taxation and foreign policy. That plan is likely to face significant opposition from members states, some of whom are likely to view it as a power-grab.In a veiled reference to US president Donald Trump, he also warned: “Europe can no longer be assured that the commitments entered into in the past will still be respected in the future. Yesterday’s alliances may no longer be tomorrow’s alliances. Today’s world needs a strong united Europe.”Mr Juncker\u0026nbspsaid he wanted to continue work on European defence integration, but denied he was creating an EU army.“If Europe were to unite all the political, economic and military might of its nations, its role in the world could be strengthened,” he said.“This is why – despite great resistance at the time – I reignited the idea of a Europe of Defence as early as 2014. And this is why I will continue to work day and night over the next months to see the European Defence Fund and Permanent Structured Cooperation in Defence become fully operational. Allow me to clarify one important point: we will not militarise the European Union. What we want is to become more autonomous and live up to our global responsibilities.”Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

BrexitCitizens could be hit with painful roaming charges after no-deal BrexiTories backing far-right Orban to boost Brexit, says Muslim councilKeir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, said: “The only reason the government is talking about no deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal.“With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first.”The threat to the Eurostar was revealed by Nathalie Loiseau, France’s minister for European affairs, who said it was “correct” that both trains and planes from the UK would be barred.“If we reach no agreement this is what will happen, among other things,” she told an event in London.The warning came one week after a secret Treasury document acknowledged there were questions about “rail access to the EU” if there is a no-deal Brexit.But No 10 refused to discuss what was meant by the reference on the “Operation Yellowhammer” document, photographed as a minister carried it into a Whitehall meeting.The government has previously acknowledged that planes would be grounded without a post-Brexit agreement, while insisting the prospect was remote.Asked about the risk to Eurostar services, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “It’s in everybody’s interest that that should not happen.”Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, speaking after a three-hour cabinet meeting, said: “We have agreed all of that plan of action with unanimity.“I think we need to be honest about this. In the event of a no-deal scenario, which is not what we want, we would face short-term risks and short-term disruption.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/dog-beer.jpg  width= 1966  height= 1474  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/10/dog-beer.jpg","title":"wetherspoons price rises brexit no deal tim martin","story":"Created with Sketch.Pub chain said it will hike prices rather than cut costs on staff and serviceClick to followThe IndependentWetherspoons warns of price rises as boss repeats call for no-deal BrexitJD Wetherspoon has reported a jump in sales in the last year, but warned prices are likely to rise over the coming 12 months. The discount pub chain said like-for-like sales went up 5 per cent in the year to 29 July, while revenue rose 2 per cent to £1.69bn, and pre-tax profit increased by 4.3 per cent to £107m.Tim Martin, the group’s chairman, used the results statement to reiterate his support for a hard Brexit. “There will be a huge gain for business and consumers if the UK copies the free trade approach of countries like Singapore, Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Israel, by slashing protectionist EU import taxes (‘tariffs’), on leaving the EU in March next year,” he said. “If parliament votes to end tariffs and rejects the Chequers deal, consumers and business will benefit additionally by avoiding a cost of £39bn, or £60m per UK constituency, in respect of the EU orce payment\u0026nbsp– for which there is no legal obligation.“Unfortunately, some iniduals, businesses and business organisations have mistakenly, or misleadingly, repeated the myth that food prices will rise without a deal\u0026nbspwith the EU. “In fact, the only way prices can rise post-Brexit is if parliament votes to impose tariffs.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uyghurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uyghurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uyghurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesUm Majid, left, tries an improvised gas mask on family members in her home in Binnish in Syria\u0027s rebel-held northern Idlib province as part of preparations for any upcoming raids.

I left them in so I could see.“It’s really frightening how quickly it happened. I was only swimming for about 20 minutes, yet it cost me the sight in one eye.“When I got out of the pool, my left eye was irritated, so I went back to our caravan and took my lenses out, as it was hurting so much.”Over the next few days, Emma suffered headaches and blurred vision, but not wanting to ruin the rest of the holiday for the children, decided to wait until she got home to seek medical help.She was referred to the eye casualty unit at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital later that day where she was diagnosed with anterior uveitis - an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye - and was given steroid drops.I was using the drops, but three days later, I lost the vision in my left eye, as the bacteria had multiplied very quickly.“The blurriness was getting gradually worse and when I woke up on that day and I was in so much pain I couldn’t even open my eye.It really hurt but I was quite calm because I really thought it was going to be fine. I thought it was just a really severe infection.Her partner Dean called a taxi and immediately took her back to eye casualty where she was diagnosed with microbial keratitis and microcystic corneal oedema - meaning she had a swollen and infected cornea caused by a burrowing amoeba which then led to an infected ulcer covering her whole iris.Emma was admitted for five days where she received hourly drops to try to save her eye, but it didnt work.The condition had caused full thickness scarring to Emmas left eye, meaning that she could only see movement and light through it.“When I was admitted thought it would get better and get back to normal, she explained.“But, after a few days in hospital I was told by the doctor how serious it was and that the vision would never be back to what it was.“I was shocked, but at the time, I was in too much pain to really take it in.In the following year, Emmas vision deteriorated further.In April 2016, however, she was told that she would be a suitable candidate for a cornea transplant - where the damaged tissue is removed and replaced by healthy tissue from a donor.Emma said: We hoped my eye would heal, but it just kept getting worse. I struggled to live with just one eye and eventually, doctors agreed the cornea transplant was my best option.”After a two month wait, she was taken for her transplant at the centre for sight in East Grinstead, West Sussex, on 1 June 2016.Most opticians advise that contact lense wearers wear swimming goggles for swimming - mainly to reduce the risk of contacts being dislodged.But swimming with contacts can result in eye infections, irritation and potentially sight-threatening conditions such as corneal ulcers .In fact, the FDA has recommended that contacts are not exposed to ANY type of water - including tap water, showers, hot tubs, swimming pools and lakes.If in doubt, take them out before getting wet.Emma was awake during the whole operation and says that the nurse continued to talk to her throughout.The waiting list isn’t very long, as the cornea doesn’t need to be matched like other organs, but it is a very unusual operation, as you are awake throughout and it is done under local anaesthetic.“They numbed my eye and I was told not to move at all. A nurse held my hand, so I could squeeze  I felt pain. I mainly remember just seeing colours and I could only feel the pressure on my eye and sometimes a tiny bit of pain.”It took less than half an hour and Emma was able to leave hospital later that day.She said: As it healed, I started to be able to see more and more. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to remove the full scaring.I can now see more out of that eye but it’s not completely clear. Before it was like looking through a big puffy cloud and now I can see things but they just aren’t perfectly in focus.I suffer from dry eye but it’s worth it to be able to see again.”She added: “My mum, Kim, was amazing throughout everything and helped to care for me while Dean looked after the children. I couldn’t have got through this without my family and friends.“I don’t think people realise the serious dangers of wearing lenses in water. I do still wear a contact lense in one eye but I am much more aware of the dangers.I wear a daily disposable contact lense because I prefer to throwing it away every day. I think everyone just needs to treat them with care.“I’m so grateful for whoever allowed their corneas to be donated as they’ve helped to give me my sight back.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000432156526-e1536606196495.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"strictly stacey dooley celeb island","story":"They have to mask their disappointment, I understand, but the words “Your partner will be . . .  KEVIN!” were no sooner out of the host’s mouth than he was off, pogo dancing round the studio, punching the air and screaming: “YAAAAAAAAAS YES! YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swt to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers  they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure  13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And  they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lt-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, dferent-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And  Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautul Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even  it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal .She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our orce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even  Barnier breathes le into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.IT’S easy to dismiss Boris Johnson’s call for tax cuts as a ruse to distract from his personal dficulties.

We should do the same — and put more money in pockets . . .Not drain more le out of the economy.PARLIAMENT’S seats must be reformed to make elections fairer. The logic is ­unassailable. MPs must not reject it out of self-interest.It’s not a plot by the independent Boundary Commission against Brexiters. Nor is it against Labour, who ­routinely end up with more MPs than they deserve because they need fewer votes to win safe seats than the Tories.Each vote must carry the same weight.So boundaries must change and constituencies must be evened up, regardless of the upheaval — or the senior politicians inconvenienced.

It will also make le more dficult in innumerable ways - affecting driving licences, passports and phone bills.Today is just a cynical ploy by the Government to make whatever pathetic little deal they bring back from Brussels look less bad in comparison.Emmanuel Macrons Europe minister warned that Eurostar trains and planes from Britain will be turned away from France in the event of a No Deal Brexit.In comments that came just an hour after the Government papers were published, Nathalie Loiseau insisted it was not Le Project Fear to warn of travel chaos that but it “would happen – among other examples”.Asked about the issue following a speech in London, she said: This is the reason we need to prepare for a No Deal because we cannot wake up and say to our citizens and businesses we thought it would never happen so we are not ready.Cabinet ministers met this morning to discuss the No Deal contingency plans which are designed to ensure Britain is ready for the possible collapse of talks with Brussels.Speaking before the plans were published, Dominic Raab warned rebel MPs they will have no choice but to back Theresa May - or risk Brexit chaos.He said Brexit rebels would have to be responsible and rubbished the idea they can force through an alternative plan by next March.Tory MPs from all sides of the Brexit ide have called for the PM to chuck her proposals set out at Chequers.But the Brexit Secretary said it would be impossible to replace Mrs Mays blueprint with a dferent type of trade deal.He told the BBCs Today programme: When push comes to shove it will be a binary choice between the deal we bring back and No Deal, and I think that will focus minds.Colleagues will look at the choices theyve got and theyve got to be responsible for that.During the interview he also hit out at firms such as John Lewis which blame their economic troubles on Brexit.Mr Raab said: I think there will be the temptation from some businesses that arent doing so well to blame Brexit and I think thats a mistake.He confirmed that we wont pay a £39billion orce bill  we dont manage to secure a withdrawal agreement.Mr Raab said: Its not a threat, its statement of fact as part of our No Deal planning.We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.DOZENS of Brexit-backing Tory MPs are furious with Theresa Mays Chequers plan, which would see Britain following EU rules for goods even after weve left.They have launched a huge campaign to persuade the PM to drop her proposals and replace them with a looser free-trade deal.Some hardliners are even trying to ditch Mrs May altogether - convinced that only a Brexit true believer can truly carry out the will of the people.But both efforts are massively complicated by the fact that we have just six months before Britain officially leaves the EU.Senior Brexiteers are in despair about the leadership chatter, warning that  the PM was forced out Remainers would seize the opportunity to delay or even overturn Brexit.And as Dominic Raab points out today, the short timeline makes it dficult for any plan other than Mrs Mays to take shape.If Britain and the EU do thrash out a withdrawal deal later this year, it will almost certainly be based on the PMs Chequers deal.MPs will have a straight choice when it comes to a Commons vote - support the deal as it stands, or back No Deal.Ministers are gambling that enough Tories will lose their nerve and vote with the Government to outnumber the rebels who team up with Jeremy Corbyn to try and defeat it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But images of Skripal and his daughter walking through the town show the weather to be mild with the ground free of slush.They claim: The Russians say they arrived in Salisbury on March 3, the day before the attack, but insist they left early then too due to snow.Boshirov said: On the 3rd we spent no more than an hour there.What we know: The pair were pictured on CCTV at a train station in Salisbury on that day. Despite claiming they only spent an hour there, authorities say they left after 4pm having arrived at 2.25pm. UK police believe the two were carrying out a practice run.They claim: They say friends had been suggesting that they visit Salisbury.What we know: They chose not to stay in one of more than 60 hotels and guesthouses in the city. Instead, they went back and forth on trains from London.They claim: The alleged hit men claim they “hadn’t heard” the name Skripal before the attack and do not know whether they walked by his house.Boshirov said: “Maybe we passed by it, maybe we didnt pass by it, I dont know, I hadnt heard this surname.”What we know: The pair claim they were in Salisbury to visit the cathedral – however, after leaving the train station they were shown on CCTV walking north-west towards the Skripal’s home, instead of south-east towards the church.At 11.58am on March 4, the pair are spotted in Wilton Road, less than a mile from Christie Miller Road, Mr Skripals address. Police say this was just “moments before” the attack.They then caught the train back to London at 1.05pm - having arrived in Salisbury at around 11.48am. The pair then fly back to Moscow from Heathrow later that evening.They claim: Petrov claims they wanted see nearby Stonehenge but it didn’t work out because of the slush.What we know: A spokesman for bus operator Salisbury Reds said: The tour buses ran as normal on Sunday 4 March.They claim: The men claim to have pictures of their visit to the cathedral. Conspiracy theorists had said British authorities faked the images of them in the city. Boshirov also said CCTV photos of them walking through Gatwick may have been faked because of the timestamp.What we know: They have failed to release pictures of them at the tourist sight but have admitted they were in the city, rubbishing conspiracy theories. Cops have already said there are two parallel channels at the airport.They claim: The alleged assassins claims they are midscale entrepreneurs involved in the fitness industry who deal in everything that comes to sport nutrition, vitamins, micro-elements, proteins and so on.What we know: Prime Minister Theresa May said that based on the body of intelligence the pair are officers from the Russian military intelligence service.They claim: The pair say they were in the country for a holiday.What we know: They havent explained why they had booked two alternative  flights home.1740: The pair arrive at London Victoria station by train from Gatwick.1800: They then travel on public transport to Waterloo station, and then to the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London, where they stay for two nights.Saturday March 31145: The pair arrive at Waterloo station, having left the hotel, bound for Salisbury.

Mark Carney also warned of a worst-case scenario where the pound plummets and the UK could be tipped into recession. Mr Carney briefed Theresa May and senior ministers on the Bank\u0027s planning for a clf-edge break with the EU at a special Cabinet meeting on Thursday to review the Government\u0027s no-deal preparations. It is understood he warned house prices could fall by up to 35% over three years, as sterling plummeted and the Bank was forced to push up interest rates.  According to reports, he compared the fall-out from such a chaotic departure to the 2008 global financial crash. Ministers were said to have listened in silence as he and Chancellor Philip Hammond spelled out the grim consequences for the economy. His bleak prognosis came as France said it could halt flights and Eurostar trains from the UK  there was no agreement when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. The Bank of England declined to comment on Mr Carney\u0027s briefing to ministers.  However it follows the Bank\u0027s latest annual stress test of the UK financial system in November 2017, which warned of a 33% fall in house prices in a worst case scenario. Today the head of business body the CBI warned a no-deal exit from the European Union would deliver a hammer blow to the British economy,. Carolyn Fairbairn warned against throwing everything up in the air by tearing up Theresa May\u0027s current plan, drawn up at Chequers, and seeking an alternative solution with fewer than 200 days to go.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Ms Fairbairn said I\u0027m afraid that this is happening in the here and now, so the urgency of stepping back from the clf-edge is growing daily. The hammer blow to our economy would be enormous and I think many smaller businesses can\u0027t properly prepare and that just doubles the potential impact  we go over that clf. We have to have a deal. Meanwhile, France\u0027s Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau, in London for talks with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, warned that Paris could halt major transport links with the UK in the absence of a Brexit deal. Speaking at the Chatham House international affairs think tank, she said EU member states were working on measures to ensure there was not chaos after Britain leaves on March 29.  Asked whether, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, it was a real possibility Eurostar trains from London could be rejected and planes leaving Britain turned back, she said: The consequences of a no-deal which you mentioned are correct. If we do nothing and  we reach no agreement, this is what would happen, among other examples.

After the results were announced, she tweeted: I want to thank all of the TeamCynthia volunteers, supporters, and voters who dedicated their time to championing the progressive message of our campaign. I’m so proud of all the work we\u0027ve done to build a New York that works for all of us.

Nixon, best known for her Emmy-winning role on HBO\u0027s Sex and the City, had been trailing Cuomo by 30 points or more in opinion polls. The race had turned increasingly bitter and expensive, as Cuomo spent 18 million to Nixon\u0027s 1.6 million, according to state figures.   Nixon, who has never held office, has said Cuomo\u0027s experience has not translated to good governance, Cuomo has said she is inexperienced and naive. In a contentious debate last month, Cuomo told Nixon to stop interrupting him, to which she responded: Can you stop lying? Cuomo, 60, was born into politics as the son of Mario Cuomo, a longtime public figure who also served as New York governor.  The younger Cuomo, a former Clinton administration official, controls the party\u0027s state machinery and secured endorsements from members of the party establishment. Before casting his ballot at a church in the town of Mount Kisco, Cuomo said New Yorkers must stand up to changes being made in Washington that he said ran counter to the state\u0027s values, according to local channel News 12 Westchester. There is a isiveness that is coming out of Washington that I think is cancerous to our nation, Cuomo said.  Nixon, 52, has touted herself as a democratic socialist and a champion of causes such as abortion access, better funding for schools and equal rights for gay and lesbian people. She greeted voters in Manhattan\u0027s Union Square on Thursday and cast her ballot at an East Village community centre. My family didn\u0027t have a lot of money, but I had opportunities that I don\u0027t see for the vast majority of kids today. We can change that, she appealed to voters on Twitter.

But these No Deal Brexit warnings suggest it\u0027ll turn into a head-scratching mess of hassle, faff and red tape. Tory ministers have published 28 new papers showing how they\u0027re preparing for the unlikely event there\u0027s no agreement with Brussels. And crucially, today\u0027s documents spell out how you the British public should prepare too. You could have to renew your passport, buy a driving permit and buy special mobile phone packages  the UK crashes out on 29 March 2019. Today\u0027s is the second batch of no deal papers after 25 were published last month, and there\u0027s at least one further batch to come.  Already critics claim they make a mockery of promises that Brexit would sweep away red tape. Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “Our smallest firms simply do not have the capacity or resources to deal with added costs and administrative burden that an unplanned no-deal Brexit will bring. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer added: The only reason the government is talking about no deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal. Today\u0027s papers were agreed after a marathon three-hour special Cabinet meeting on no deal, that heard from Bank of England governor Mark Carney.  EU chiefs have said a deal is possible by mid-November, but Theresa May is still trying to rally MPs round the main element of her plan for customs drawn up at Chequers. Up to 50 right-wing Brexiteer Tories met in Parliament this week and some openly discussed ousting the Prime Minister. That prompted a counter-meeting of a similar number of pro-May MPs in Parliament last night. A new clash is also in the pipeline just days before the Tory conference, with The Times reporting Mrs May will convene a special Cabinet meeting to discuss a hardline post-Brexit immigration strategy to please the Tory grassroots. Meanwhile the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, has claimed Britain will REFUSE to pay its \u0026pound39bn Brexit orce bill in full  there is no deal with the EU. So what do the papers say? Have a read and judge for yourself. 1. You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter \u0027Schengen area\u0027 countries with a valid passport even  they only have a day left before they expire. But in the event of a no deal Brexit, after 29 March 2019 you may not be able to travel to these countries  you have less than six months left on your passport. The government is now advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months\u0027 remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, the technical note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  If there’s no deal, we’ll lose access to the EU’s Space Surveillance and Tracking service - the system that stops satellites crashing into each other. The system also provides member states with early warnings about satellites and debris from space vehicles falling back to Earth. We will, however, continue to receive space surveillance and tracking data from the United States. We\u0027ll just have to trust Donald Trump. This note doesn\u0027t include asteroids, which are monitored by a separate system. But regardless, Labour MP Jo Stevens of the Best For Britain group said: Theresa May used to say Brexit wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world - but actually it could be! 3. You could have to buy a \u0026pound5.50 licence for a French day trip  Motorists may need special permits to drive in the EU. UK licences are all visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, they may need an International Driving Permit. The \u0026pound5.50 documents would be sold at 2,500 post offices from February. Currently they\u0027re sold at fewer than 100, and earlier this year the National Audit Office warned the government was not ready. The number of permits issued would have to soar from 100,000 a year to 7million.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June 2017, meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreement  the UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing 85% of customers - Three, EE, O2 and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government warns.  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on 29 March 2019. Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advice  they will not finish by Brexit Day. The technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” Under a similar principle, companies applying to make EU firms insolvent or those seeking to chase small debts could also have to seek legal advice. 6. UK cars won\u0027t be automatically \u0027valid for sale\u0027 in the EU  British carmakers and firms supplying car parts from the UK would face more red tape to sell their vehicles and components on the continent. The paper says: “In a no deal scenario,  type-approval issued in the UK would no longer be valid for sales or registrations on the EU market. EC type-approvals issued outside of the UK, would no longer be automatically accepted on the UK market. This means that affected manufacturers would need to ensure that they have the correct type-approval for each market.” The Best for Britain anti-Brexit group claims this could be another blow to the motor industry - which employs thousands of hard-working Brits. 7. Medicines and perfumes \u0027could become more expensive\u0027  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. So  we leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between \u0026pound109 and \u0026pound3,665. They will also need an import/export license, which costs \u0026pound24. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. But  there’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks won\u0027t be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. 8. Shopkeepers could be slapped with a bicycle ban  UK shops will face fresh red tape or could even be banned from importing a string of items such as bicycles, cooking utensils or furniture. The change affects ‘non-harmonised’ manufactured goods. This means goods which have strict standards in UK law, which aren’t matched across the EU as a whole. Currently, a product made to fit one EU country’s standards can then be marketed legally in any other EU country. This is called “mutual recognition”. So a bicycle made to French standards can be marketed in the UK, even  it would not normally meet UK standards. But in a no deal Brexit, all these imports to the UK will have to meet UK standards. It will be up to inidual businesses to ensure their products meet those standards. The notice does not cover food, for which officials say “further information will be provided in due course”. 9. UK taxpayers could have to match billions in funding that used to come from the EU "},{"url":null,"title":"union chief mark serwotka recorded","story":"NewsMark Serwotka suggests Israel \u0027created\u0027 Labour anti-Semitism row in recording of PCS union chief\"I\u0027m not a conspiracy theorist, but I\u0027ll tell you what,\" Mark Serwotka was recorded sayingShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor10:51, 14 SEP 2018Updated10:59, 14 SEP 2018NewsMark Serwotka said I\u0027m not a conspiracy theorist, but suggested an aggressor could perform such an action to hide from the atrocities you are committing \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A recording has emerged of a top union chief suggesting Israel created a story that does not exist about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party .  Mark Serwotka said I\u0027m not a conspiracy theorist, but suggested an aggressor could go on the offensive and perform such an action to hide from the atrocities you are committing.  A tape emerged last night of the Public and Commercial Services union chief, a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn , making the comments at a fringe event during this week\u0027s Trades Union Congress in Manchester.  In it, he slammed the killing of dozens of Palestinians by Israel\u0027s military and cutting off aid, which makes it even more important to call for an end to the blockade of Gaza.  According to the recording, published by The Independent, he then added: Isn\u0027t it a funny old world where instead of being on the front foot, denouncing these atrocities, demanding an independent and sovereign state for the Palestinian people, that we have had a summer of asking ourselves whether leading Labour movement people are in any way anti-semitic.   Now I\u0027m not a conspiracy theorist, but I\u0027ll tell you what. One of the best forms of actually trying to hide from the atrocities that you are committing is to go on the offensive and to actually create a story that does not exist for people on this platform, the trade union movement or, I have to say, for the leader of the Labour Party. Mr Serwotka also attacked Donald Trump\u0027s decision to sht the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - a isive move that broke with a decades-old international position and triggered furious protests. The PCS represents around 200,000 members. Mike Katz of the Jewish Labour Movement tweeted: Top tip:  you want people to believe you think Labour Antisemitism is a problem, don\u0027t use a conspiracy theory involving Israel to explain why it\u0027s an issue.

Daring participants used a whole host of props - including footballs, boots and skis - to strategically hide their privates from prying eyes. Undergraduate Emma Teal said her fellow nudists had fun while posing for the cheeky fundraiser.  She said: We all really enjoyed making the calendar, although it did involve a lot of early mornings as we had to go to the locations when there weren\u0027t too many people about. Emma continued: “I\u0027ve been involved in quite a lot of charity projects over the years, from volunteering my time, to completing physical challenges to fund raise. So when I came to university I knew I wanted to join a charitable society, and creating a naked calendar with Cambridge Raising and Giving  society seemed like the most fun way to raise lots of money for great causes.”  The calendar will go on sale from October 10 and will cost \u0026pound10. Last year\u0027s edition, which was the first time the calendar was published, raised over \u0026pound10,000 for charitable causes. Funds raised this time around will go to a host of charities including Beat Eating Disorders, Mary\u0027s Meals Papyrus and the Cambridge Rape Crisis Centre.  Students at the renowned institution are no stranger to nakedness.  Each year Cambridge runs a Best Bum competition which sees dozens of entries from fearless scholars.

Alisha Anderson, from Bransholme, Hull, says she has been left with burns to her face and suffering from depression after the attacks. The year nine pupil who attends Kingswood Academy, was reportedly first attacked on a footpath as she walked to school on the morning of September 6.  She says an older girl strangled her for around 90 seconds as two others watched and egged her on, reports Hull Live .  Alisha was saved by a woman passing by who alarmed the alleged attackers and caused them to flee, the schoolgirl said.  Describing the first encounter, Alisha said: “They just strangled me for no reason. They were saying I had been picking on someone even though I haven’t. When I asked them who they wouldn’t tell me. “I had a red mark on my neck which turned into bruising. I went to school as normal after that and told the teacher who rang my dad.” Alisha was targeted once again on Sunday, September 9, by the same group of girls who punched her in the face at around 4pm after chasing her down Biggin Avenue. Then, on Wednesday, September 12, the gang, which Alisha says is made up of 17-year-olds, attacked her again by pinning her down in an underpass near Cleeve School and holding a lighter to her hand and her face. After three attacks in seven days, Alisha is now too terried to leave the family home and the sequence of events has made her depressed. She said: “It was very scary to have that happen to me and I am scared to go outside in case these girls find me. I can’t go outside my own house without getting hurt. “It’s made me upset and depressed. I just want them to go away.”   Alisha’s father Damian Colville, 43, who has posted about the attacks on Facebook and informed Humberside Police, says his daughter has been targeted after vicious rumours were spread about her by former friends.  The dad-of-five said: “Ex friends of hers have been spreading rumours that she has beaten a five or six-year-old bain and we’ve had gangs of 10 to 20 people outside my door before. “It’s not true at all because  it was I would have definitely had one of their parents or somebody here but we’ve had nobody and no police here. “It’s just annoying and there is no need for it, especially when she has done nothing to anybody. Mr Colville said he is now constantly worried about his daughter’s wellbeing and fears for her safety whenever she ventures outside from the family home. “I’m terried for her,” he said. “I don’t know  she will come back safe  I send her to the local shop. “If I can’t make it to follow her to school or take her there myself she has to go on her own. I’m having to try and swap things over and change things about so I can take her.  “It’s disgusting and  these girls can do what they have already done with no feelings whatsoever it just makes you wonder what else they are capable of. Next time they could be breaking her arms or legs and  she gets that depressed she could end up taking her own le. “She is already getting angry quicker with her brothers and sisters compared to how she used to and it’s just frustrating. You want your children to be able to get on with their lives but she’s not able to do that.”  Determined to find the culprits, Mr Colville is logging every incident with Humberside Police who are investigating the series of attacks made against Alisha. He says he will not rest until they are found and he had this message for the group of girls targeting his daughter.  “They need to just leave her alone,” Mr Colville said. “She has not done what they are saying and  she had I would have had the police here. “You need to give it up and let her get on with her le.” "},{"url":null,"title":"guide best new ebikes plus","story":"AdvertorialFind your nearest cycle route using our new tool - plus the bikes you can use to ride it without breaking a sweatWe\u0027ve put together a list of some great eBikes and some longer routes to enjoy them onShare\u0026nbspByDave Masters12:49, 4 SEP 2018Updated11:13, 14 SEP 2018Advertorial\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of the great advantages of eBikes is their ability to get you further with less effort.

The National Cycle Network is made up of some 14,000 miles of routes and spans the whole of the UK - with half the population living within a mile of their closest route. You can find your nearest one simply by popping your postcode into our handy cycle route finder below.   Below we\u0027ve also showcased some of the best eBikes on the market - and picked some great routes to really get the benefit out of them!

Gerry McDermott, 63, was fuming when he realised he had misplaced his wallet, containing \u0026pound80 and all his bank cards, somewhere near the Swedish homeware shop in Warrington. The self-employed business owner frantically searched for it - even ing to Warrington the next day - but it was nowhere to be found, reports the Liverpool Echo . Two days later, Gerry received an unusual letter through his door from someone claiming they had found his wallet and wanted to  it. Gerry said he initially thought the letter had been written by a child because the handwriting was dficult to interpret.  The letter gave an address in Croxeth where Gerry could go to collect his lost wallet - but when he arrived he was surprised to find a young family who had only arrived in Liverpool last week. Gerry said: I went to IKEA on Monday afternoon to do a bit of shopping with my we, came out of the store and thought \u0027s*** - where\u0027s my wallet?\u0027 I couldn\u0027t find it. I even drove back to Warrington to scour the ground. Then on Wednesday, after I\u0027d gone through the process of reissuing all my cards, I got this note through the door saying someone had found my wallet. They had posted this letter to me.  I opened this letter and rang the number. A kid answered with a strange accent which I thought was actually American, saying come and get your wallet and bring something so we know it\u0027s you. I go over and it\u0027s a family of five with two young boys and a girl. They would not take a penny off me. There was 80 quid in this wallet and all my cards which are contactless - they could have had a field day.  The family, who did not wish to be named, arrived in Liverpool last week from Sweden, where they had been living since emigrating from Kurdistan in 2003. Gerry said: They are obviously a really nice family. People have a poor view of immigrants and I want to redress the balance with this.

Kelly Burndred went from 20 stone to just 10.5 stone, but her new slim figure did not bring her the happiness she had craved and she felt like there was nowhere else to turn. The 37-year-old became a dferent person plagued by even darker thoughts as the pounds dropped off following a gastric bypass in 2015.  Kelly\u0027s husband Gareth set up a support group in her name after she hanged herself, and has now warned how losing weight cannot solve depression, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports.   The mum-of-one\u0027s fixation with her size, which started as a young girl, was a symptom of her own internal struggle with her mental health. After two unsuccessful suicide attempts, Kelly took her own le in April this year. Gareth, 37, from Chesterton, Staffordshire, said: “Kelly had suffered most of her le. On the outside, she was very bubbly and confident and had loads of friends. But inside, she was struggling. “After our daughter was born she had crippling post-natal depression but she overcame it, or so we thought.  “We hoped, after the gastric bypass, that Kelly would find the happiness she craved. But her depression got much worse. She had blamed all her problems, all her le, on her weight. So when she became thin, and she wasn’t happy, she felt like there was nowhere else to turn. “I want to stress how important it is to speak out. I just hope that Kelly’s story, and the support group, will help to save another le.” Gareth and Kelly met on New Year’s Eve 2001 in a nightclub.  He said: “We were two opposites, and yet we just clicked. I was quiet and shy, and Kelly was loud, bubbly and chatty. “As I got to know her better, I realised that Kelly’s confidence was just a front. Deep down, she was very insecure and unhappy with the way she looked.” Two years on, they had a daughter, Jess, now aged 14. Gareth said: “Kelly had been told she would never be able to have children because she had polycystic oies so when she fell pregnant it was a huge surprise. We couldn’t wait for our baby to arrive.  “Kelly loved being a mum, but she showed signs straightaway of post-natal depression. She didn’t want to leave the house and she became very withdrawn and anxious. “She wouldn’t put Jess to bed because she was afraid something might happen to her during the night. I put Jess to bed every night. She didn’t trust herself as a mum and it was hard. “I tried to support Kelly, but I felt she was pushing me away. Our relationship suffered and we went through a really bad patch. “But in time, the depression eased and we became closer again.” And in 2008, Kelly proposed.  Gareth said: “Kelly was around a size 26 when we got married, but to me, she looked stunning. I know she was unhappy with her weight, but it just didn’t matter to me. “She had been bullied all through school because of her weight. It had always been a problem for her. She got down to a size 16 after one diet but it all crept back on.” In 2010, Kelly was awarded a forensic science degree at university. Gareth said: “I was really proud of her. She got a job at the council and she had loads of mates, she was really popular.” By 2014, Kelly’s weight had hit 30 stone. She was referred for gastric bypass surgery in March 2015.  Gareth said: “The surgery was a big step and it was a worry, but I knew how desperate she was. I just hoped this would help to make her happy.” Kelly seemed to cope well with the surgery and her weight dropped to just over ten stones. But her hair fell out, which was a recognised side effect. Gareth said: “She had a weave done, to cover up her bald patches. When I collected her from the salon she looked so young and beautul and I told her how much I loved her. I will always remember that moment.” But following the surgery, Kelly’s character changed. Gareth said: “After the weight loss, Kelly changed mentally as well as physically. I really felt as though she was two people and I knew she felt the same.  “She would say: ‘I know I should be happy now, but I’m not.’ She was scared of reaching her goal weight because she didn’t want the journey to end. “Now she had got what she wanted, she didn’t want it. All her le, she had blamed everything on her weight, and now she was thin and she realised her problems were still there. “Her depression became much worse.” Kelly also struggled with excess skin left by her weight loss. Gareth said: “She was very self-conscious about her excess skin and she refused to let me see her naked. She asked for surgery but the GP couldn’t help.” Eight months ago, Gareth was woken during the night to find Kelly running a bath and carrying an extension lead into the bathroom. She admitted she was planning to kill herself.  He said: “I was panic stricken. I began keeping an eye on her and we asked for a mental health appointment, but there was a two-month wait which was incredibly frustrating. “I began keeping a close eye on her. But another night, whilst I was sleeping, she slipped out of the house. I had to call the police and they found her, not far away. She admitted she had been planning to jump from a bridge. I was out of my mind with worry. “Kelly’s parents, Bryan and Doreen, kindly offered to pay for a private consultation and in April she finally saw a consultant. She was prescribed medication and I finally felt a sense of relief. I really felt she was making progress. “Two days later, there was a TV programme about a Hollywood star’s suicide. “Kelly made a point of us watching it together. Looking back, I wonder  this was a warning sign. I wonder  it is something I could have picked up on. “The next night, Jess was staying over with her grandparents. Kelly and I watched a film, and we had a couple of glasses of wine and afterwards, we made love. It was a really special evening.  “Again, looking back, I wonder  she had planned this – knowing what was coming next. I just don’t know. “Late that night, we lay in bed in each other’s arms, and Kelly said she couldn’t sleep and she wanted to go downstairs. I made her promise to come back to bed in an hour. I didn’t want her up all night, worrying. “I could hear her downstairs, I thought maybe she was on the phone, and eventually, I drted off to sleep.” Gareth woke early the following morning for work, and Kelly’s side of the bed was empty. He said: “I just thought she had slept downstairs. I went to find her and I saw her, lying on the floor, behind our French doors. But I still thought she was asleep. “I went over to her and said her name. But, as I touched her leg, it was stone cold and I panicked. I was pleading with her to wake up. “I grabbed my phone to call an ambulance. I felt certain the paramedics would save her.” Kelly could not be saved and she was pronounced dead that morning aged just 37.

Emma Jenkins, from Bournemouth, was on holiday in Scotland when she took a dip in the caravan park\u0027s on-site pool. But the 39-year-old kept her contact lenses in, allowing microscopic bacteria to get into her eye and destroy her cornea - leaving her blind in one eye. She explained: “I had no idea that wearing contact lenses in the pool was so risky. I left them in so I could see. It\u0027s really frightening how quickly it happened. I was only swimming for about 20 minutes, yet it cost me the sight in one eye.  When I got out of the pool, my left eye was irritated, so I went back to our caravan and took my lenses out, as it was hurting so much. “Over the next few days, I was getting headaches and my vision was very blurry. Trying to enjoy the rest of her week-long holiday in October 2013, so as not to ruin it for her children and partner, Dean Keith, 30, Emma waited until she got home to see her doctor. Referred to eye casualty at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital later that day, she was diagnosed with anterior uveitis - an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye - and given steroid drops. She continued: “I was using the drops, but three days later, I lost the vision in my left eye, as the bacteria had multiplied very quickly. The blurriness was getting gradually worse and when I woke up on that day and I was in so much pain I couldn\u0027t even open my eye. It really hurt but I was quite calm because I really thought it was going to be fine. I thought it was just a really severe infection.  Dean, a hospitality supervisor, called a taxi and immediately took her back to eye casualty, where she was diagnosed with microbial keratitis and a microcystic corneal oedema – meaning she had a swollen and infected cornea, the clear window on the front of the eye. “It caused a massive ulcer that covered my whole iris, she said. They admitted me for five days with hourly drops to try and save my eye, but it didn’t work and I was sent home on November 1 2013.” The condition had caused full thickness scarring to Emma’s left eye, meaning she could only see movement and light through it. She said: “When I was admitted thought it would get better and get back to normal. But, after a few days in hospital I was told by the doctor how serious it was and that the vision would never be back to what it was. I was shocked, but at the time, I was in too much pain to really take it in.”  In the years that followed, Emma’s vision in her left eye deteriorated further. Then, in April 2016, she was told she would be a suitable candidate for a cornea transplant - where the damaged tissue is removed and replaced with healthy tissue from a donor - in a bid to restore some sight. She explained: “We hoped my eye would heal, but it just kept getting worse. I struggled to live with just one eye and eventually, doctors agreed the cornea transplant was my best option.” After a two month wait, Emma was taken for her transplant, at the centre for sight in East Grinstead, West Sussex, on June 1, 2016. She explained: “The waiting list isn’t very long, as the cornea doesn’t need to be matched like other organs, but it is a very unusual operation, as you are awake throughout and it is done under local anaesthetic. They numbed my eye and I was told not to move at all. A nurse held my hand, so I could squeeze  I felt pain. I mainly remember just seeing colours and I could only feel the pressure on my eye and sometimes a tiny bit of pain. The nurse spoke to me the whole time, telling me I was doing great. The procedure took less than half an hour and Emma was able to leave hospital later that day.

The cameras feature new LED infrared equipment and they look nothing like the traditional ones that drivers are used to seeing at the roadside. They face oncoming traffic and some motorists may not realise they are cameras at all. In addition to speeding, the equipment can catch drivers who aren\u0027t wearing a seatbelt or are using their phone, eating, drinking or smoking when they\u0027re meant to be concentrating on the road, Devon Live reports.  The technology, part of the new Safety Camera Partnership, is meant to snare speeding drivers more effectively. A cluster of cameras has been set up along Gdynia Way, which leads into into Plymouth city centre in Devon. The cameras face oncoming traffic, while an accompanying LED box system is positioned 20 yards before them. How do average speed cameras work?  The multiple cameras  are set at separate locations along a stretch of road  and are synchronised to record the exact time that each car passes using number plate reading technology. Then a computer will work out the average speed between the cameras to determine  the car was over the speed limit. Some people wrongly think that each camera records a driver\u0027s speed as they pass each camera before the computer works out the average speed as the car passed every camera - this explains why some drivers think they can speed up between the cameras and slow down as they pass them. But doing this is likely to land you with a fine - the cameras simply record the time you pass them and the computer works out how long it has taken you to pass the distance between them. Do the cameras work at night?  Yes. They are fitted with infra red illuminators to ensure they work night and day, and all weathers. Can the cameras run out of film? No. Unlike some other speed cameras, average speed camera information is saved to a computer. Can the cameras catch motorbikes? Yes. The cameras are equipped to capture all types of vehicles. If a vehicle changes lanes will they avoid any fines? No. The cameras calculate for lane changes. But this myth can mean people dangerously switch lanes increasing the chance of crashes.

Michelle Pearson, 36, was left in a coma after two lit petrol bombs were tossed inside her family home in Salford, Greater Manchester, last December. Her children Demi, 15, Brandon, eight, Lacie, seven, and three-year-old Lia all died after suffering smoke inhalation and burns in the devastating fire. This morning, the youngsters were carried into their funeral service in themed coffins - and in age order - by their heartbroken loved ones. Michelle sadly could not leave hospital to attend the church service due to unforeseen medical circumstances - but a message from her was read out.   In the moving tribute - her first since the deadly attack - she described her beloved children as so close, the Manchester Evening News reports.  The grieving mother said: They were the twinkle in my eye, now they are angels in the sky. One day we will be reunited together forever. She also mentioned each of her kids in turn, saying of little Lia: “She is dead clever, big blue eyes and a smile that melted your heart.” She added of Lacie: She loves to dance and sing. She would turn the TV on and just sing and dance along. It makes me smile just thinking about it.” Michelle described Brandon as a little architect in the making.  He promised me he would build me a house, she said in the tribute. And of Demi, she said: “We did a lot together. She was my best friend.”  The tribute was read to the emotional congregation inside St Paul\u0027s Church in Walkden after the children\u0027s colourful coffins were taken inside. Mourners had earlier struggled to fight back tears as Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Lia were carried into the service, while bagpipers played Amazing Grace. The procession had started on Jackson Street in the Walkden area - the same road the murders took place in just a fortnight before Christmas. The siblings were carried through the streets - lined by well wishers - in four stunning horse-drawn carriages, featuring flowers spelling out their names.  Three carriages were white, with the one carrying Demi rainbow-themed. Hundreds gathered to bid a heartbreaking farewell and crowds fell silent as the procession led by bagpipers and drummers filed past.  While Demi’s coffin had a music theme, Brandon\u0027s had a Avengers one, Lacie\u0027s a My Little Pony one and Lia\u0027s a Peppa Pig one. Among the mourners were the firefighters who had battled to save the family\u0027s lives after the petrol bombs were hurled inside.  They faced on the night one of the hardest jobs they ever faced, area manager Ben Levy said. Ahead of today\u0027s funeral, a Pearson relative had written on Facebook: Well today’s the day, let’s finally put these beautul souls to rest. The procession left at 10am and was due to travel through St Mary\u0027 Park and to Bridgewater Primary School, where Brandon and Lacie had been pupils. It was then due to stop for a minute, before continuing to St Paul\u0027s.  Mourners were asked to wear black and pink for girls and black and blue for boys, while a family member told  there would be plenty of family speeches. Afterwards, the siblings are due to be laid to rest together at a private burial. Seriously ill Michelle had been determined to take the huge step of leaving hospital today to say an emotional goodbye to her four children. The mum, who was described as still critical by loved ones in July, only recently managed to talk again and has been struggling to eat. She has spent months fighting for her le, has battled a number of infections and has even had one of her eyes stitched shut because of her injuries.  Last month, a relative told us she would be attending the funeral from the hospital and that the family hoped it would be a nice, peaceful day. The relative said: The public is welcome to walk behind the horse and carriages up to the service. They are also welcome to the service and can line the streets in a mark of respect, however the burial and wake are private. We just want it to be a nice peaceful day and to give the kids a really good send-off. They added: Michelle will be attending. She will have to go from the hospital.  But yesterday, Michelle\u0027s mother Sandra Lever wrote on Facebook : Due to unforeseen medical circumstances Michelle want be able to attend the children\u0027s funeral on Friday .   Other users said they were heartbroken and gutted for the mum. One replied: We will all make her proud Sandra and give them the best send off big hugs and kisses too Michelle we all love her n miss her loads keep fighting iron lady xxxx . Another said: Aww gutted for her hope she gets better soon x. At the time of the fire, Michelle screamed Not the kids! Not my kids! before being overcome by the smoke, heat and flames that had filled her home. She was rescued from the property along with youngest daughter Lia - but the little girl tragically died in hospital two days after the incident. Demi, Brandon and Lacie, who had been sleeping in a front bedroom when the house was petrol-bombed, all perished in the blaze, a court heard.  The beautul children suffered cardiac arrests and died as a result of a combination of smoke inhalation and burns following the fire. Despite her injuries and grief, Michelle was said last month to be making progress - with her proud relatives supporting her each step of the way. The relative told us: It\u0027s a slow and long process but it will get better. Today\u0027s funeral took place nine months after the arson attack - and four months after two men were jailed for le for the children\u0027s murders. Zak Bolland, 23, was handed four le terms and told he must serve at least 40 years behind bars by a judge at Manchester Crown Court in May.  David Worrall, 26, was ordered to serve a minimum term of 37 years in prison. Bolland was also convicted of three counts of attempted murder relating to Michelle, her son Kyle Pearson, 17, and his pal, Bobby Harris. However, Worrall was found not guilty of three counts of attempted murder. A third defendant, Courtney Brierley, 20, was found not guilty of murdering the children, but convicted of the alternative of manslaughter in each case. She was handed 21 years in a young offenders’ institution. Bolland had admitted reckless arson, a charge denied by the other two. The court had heard Bolland had been involved in a petty feud with Kyle.

Ruslan Borishov and Alexander Petrov gave an interview to Russian state TV channel RT yesterday after Met Police said there was enough evidence to charge them with the attempted assassination of the ex-spy and his daughter.  The pair claimed they had flown in the UK from Moscow to visit Salisbury Cathedral, staying at a hotel in Bow, east London, but flew home due to poor weather. But their claims - which Prime Minister Theresa May has branded \u0027insulting\u0027 - don\u0027t stand up to much scrutiny.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: The last time Russian military claimed to be on holiday was when they invaded Ukraine in 2014. There are at least nine flaws with their story.  1. Traces of Novichok found in their hotel room   On Thursday the pair spoke exclusively to RT - Russia Today - which is a state-controlled TV channel. They were not subject to a forensic level of questioning by hosts who seemed happy to take them at their word. The most glaring omission was the discussion of Novichok traces discovered in the hotel room they stayed in in Bow, east London. 2. Why stay in east London on a visit to Salisbury? With a straight face the pair insisted: Our friends have been suggesting for quite a long time that we visit this wonderful city. But then why not stay there? The city has more than 60 hotels and guesthouses.  Instead the pair chose a budget hotel in Bow, east London and travelled into Salisbury on the Saturday and Sunday of their visit. 3. Snowy weather complaints Ruslan Boshirov claimed: It was impossible to get anywhere because of the snow. We were drenched up to our knees. You would expect two middle-aged Russian men to be more hardy regarding the weather but the pictures paint a dferent story of this heavy snow.  The pair can be seen happily walking the streets with a little slush on the sides of the road. And temperature-wise the mercury was rising on Saturday March 3, the first day they visited. By Sunday it was a relatively balmy 9C. 4. Pair headed in entirely wrong direction after arriving in Salisbury  The spire of Salisbury Cathedral can be seen from the train station. There is no excuse, then, for Borishov and Petrov to set off in entirely the wrong direction with CCTV capturing them walking past a Shell garage, close to the Skripal family home. While there on Sunday Met Police say they smeared deadly Novichok on the door handle. 5. Lack of holiday snaps A trip from Moscow to Salisbury - just to visit a cathedral - is quite the extravagance. But the Russian pair have not presented any photographic evidence of their holiday, although they do claim to have photos. But no CCTV places them at the 800-year-old cathedral, nor there other claims that they also went to a park, we had some coffee. We went to a coffee shop and drank coffee.  The claim they visited Salisbury to see its cathedral doesn\u0027t seem to add up, the Wiltshire city\u0027s bishop has said. Bishop of Salisbury Nicholas Holtam said he was not aware of any evidence linking Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov to the cathedral, and suggested that the Russian men might have benefited from a visit to the building and a viewing of its copy of Magna Carta. 6. Stonehenge buses NOT cancelled Petrov said the pair also wanted to see nearby Stonehenge, but it didn\u0027t work out because of the slush. A bus runs to Stonehenge, nine miles north of Salisbury, every day starting from Salisbury train station forecourt. And buses were running on March 4. A spokesman for bus operator Salisbury Reds said: The tour buses ran as normal on Sunday 4 March.  7. Bad timing If one were to believe the extraordinary story of their transcontinental visit to see a cathedral it would be sheer coincidence that, on that day, the Skripal\u0027s both fell critically ill. CCTV shows the two walking in the direction of the Skripal\u0027s home the day that Sergei and his daughter Yulia became critically ill. A high amount of Novichok was found on their door handle and traces of the same substance - produced in Russia - was found in their hotel room.  After arriving in the city at 11.48am they were at their target\u0027s house within ten minutes. They were there for less than two hours. Boshirov admitted : Maybe we passed by it, maybe we didn\u0027t pass by it, I don\u0027t know, I hadn\u0027t heard. I hadn\u0027t heard this surname, I didn\u0027t know anything about them before this situation, this nightmare with us, started. 8. Two  flights Boshirov and Petrov did not explain why they booked two alternative  flights from London to Moscow - on Sunday or Monday. On Sunday they went direct from Salisbury to Heathrow for their evening flight. But on CCTV they did not even have any luggage with them. 9.

Motorcyclist Andy Daynes said he caught the footage on his helmet cam while driving behind the van on the A11 at Attleborough, Norfolk, earlier this year. Andy, 35, of Hingham, Norwich said: I was actually on my motorbike behind him so I saw it all.  I pulled over along with some other drivers to see  he was OK. He had to be cut out of the van - but he seemed to be alright, he wasn\u0027t badly injured. It is quite a bad roundabout, he just didn\u0027t see what was coming because he was going so fast. He was on his own, he had a few cuts and bruises but the ambulance came straight away and took him to hospital. He just didn\u0027t see the roundabout coming.

Families stuck in their homes - or those whose loved ones are trapped - have posted urgent pleas on social media as teams in boats go from home to home in a race against time and rising floodwaters. There were unconfirmed claims on social media that bodies were seen floating in the water in New Bern, North Carolina, after a storm surge overwhelmed the coastal city. One desperate resident tweeted: If anybody could help... our cars is under water and so is our house stuck in attic. Phone about to die please send help. A local TV station, WCTI, issued a grim warning: If you must go to the attic you need to find a chainsaw  to cut yourself out so you don’t become trapped. The storm finally made landfall around 7am local time  after lashing the US East coast for hours.  The volunteer Cajun Navy group put out a call for boats, saying people who were trapped in their attics were running out of oxygen. About 200 residents - who either decided to stay put despite an evacuation order or were unable to leave - have been rescued and about 150 more were still waiting as water levels continued to rise in the early hours of Friday. The water rescue mission was launched as Category 1 Florence walloped the region with huge waves, torrential rain and powerful winds. Shocking video shot in nearby Belhaven showed water up to the second storey of one residence as waves crashed against the outer wall.           New Bern residents told how people were forced to climb onto their roofs or into their attics because the water was so high inside their homes. Those who were trapped on their roofs were in the dark and being battered by heavy rain and 60mph winds as they waited to be rescued by boat. People whose loved ones were trapped - including elderly parents and residents with young children - pleaded for help on social media. Many wrote that their friends or family members had mobile phones that had no charge left or were close to running out of power.  One Twitter user wrote: My sister and her familly are trapped! please send help! People in Sunnyside are in their attics waiting to be rescued. A Facebook user wrote:  and two children are trapped in house by 4-5ft of water filled to top level of porch, cars are all flooded. They need boat rescue asap. Local officials were overwhelmed by calls from people who were stranded, as rescuers went out into the monster storm and put their lives on the line to save those who didn\u0027t heed earlier warnings to get out of Florence\u0027s way. Seventeen people were stranded on one street alone in Fairfield Harbor in New Bern. The City of New Bern wrote on Twitter: Currently ~150 awaiting rescue in New Bern. We have 2 out-of-state FEMA teams here for swt water rescue.     More are on the way to help us. WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU. You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU. Emergency officials in Craven County, which includes New Bern, told CNN that it has received more than 100 calls for help from people stuck on the roofs of their homes and cars. Locals residents and volunteers, including the Cajun Navy, joined the rescue, asking people who were trapped or whose loved ones were trapped to call them or message them on social media and tell them where to go. Craven County Commissioner Steve Tyson wrote on Facebook how the Cajun Navy had rescued a family from a roof. He said he had contacted state and federal officials to tell them it was a le and death situation.  He wrote: I just spoke with Representative Mike Speciale. I explained we had le and death situations and had to Get state rescue and other resources in here immediately. He said he is on it. Senator Burr and Tellis need to get to New Bern. Light his office up in the am. That’s how you can help, light up their phones and get help here. Earlier, he wrote: We have got to have additional high water rescue in Craven County and New Bern asap. We have folks on roofs with rain and 60 mph winds we cannot get to. I’m asking all state and federal representative to get help here asap. Local resources are overwhelmed. The Cajun Navy wrote on Facebook: Calling anyone and everyone with a boat! We need boats and volunteers ASAP. We have families, elderly, children etc trapped in attics running out of oxygen. We need all hands on deck! Once this storm calms down its all hands on deck. We need anyone and everyone that has a boat. Please get ahold of our admin so we can get you out here! The calls have not stopped since Florence hit land. Staff at a local TV news channel, WCTI, were forced to flee the station in New Bern when it began taking on water.

The slow-moving storm crept toward the coastline, threatening millions of people in its path with record rainfall and punishing surf. Hurricane Florence weakened to a Category 1 storm late on Thursday night with little change in strength expected before it moves inland on Friday. Florence is about 60 miles  east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph , the Miami-based weather forecaster said.  The storm remained huge, unpredictable and potentially deadly ahead of its forecast landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, at mid-day on Friday. The centre of the storm is expected to hit North Carolina\u0027s southern coast Friday, then drt southwest before moving inland on Saturday. According to the National Hurricane Centre, this will allow enough time for almost 40 inches of rain to fall in some places.  North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference that the historic hurricane would unleash rains and floods that would inundate almost the entire state in several feet of water. The sheer size of the storm meant it could batter the U.S. East Coast with hurricane-force winds for nearly a full day, according to weather forecasters. An estimated 10 million people live in the storm\u0027s path, according to the US Weather Prediction Center, and coastal businesses and homes were boarded up in anticipation this week. More than one million people were ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia and thousands moved to emergency shelters.  Florence\u0027s maximum sustained winds were clocked today at 105mph after it was downgraded to a Category 2 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the NHC. The winds had been as high as 140mph earlier in the week. Jeff Byard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  warned residents the storm would bring a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast. Heed the warnings, Byard said.  Thursday The storm\u0027s centre was about 108 miles  east of Wilmington, North Carolina, at 3pm EDT but already some 19,000 homes and businesses were without power by mid-afternoon in the Carolinas and Virginia. Millions of people are expected to lose power from the storm and restoration could take weeks. The National Hurricane Centre also said the threat of tornadoes was increasing as Florence neared shore and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the heavy rains could trigger landslides in the western part of his state. Florence could bring wind-driven storm surges of seawater as high as 13 feet  and NHC Director Ken Graham said on Facebook they could push in as far as 2 miles .  Thursday 8pm Florence is expected to remain off the coast for the next few days, churning the coast with storm surge, high winds and flooding rainfall. Heavy rains were forecast to extend into the Appalachian Mountains, affecting parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. Emergency declarations were in force in Georgia, South andNorth Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Near the beach in Wilmington, a Waffle House restaurant, part of a chain with a reputation for staying open during disasters, had no plans to = close, even  power is lost.  Friday 4am Florence has weakened to a Category 1 storm, with little change in strength expected before it moves inland later on Friday. Florence is about 60 miles  east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph , the Miami-based weather forecaster said. More signicant weakening was expected over the weekend and into early next week while Florence moves inland, the NHC said. Le-threatening storm surges and hurricane-force winds are occurring along the North Carolina coast, with the threat of freshwater flooding seen increasing over the next several days, it added.  Friday 8am By Friday morning, the storm\u0027s wind speed is estimated to be around 100mph as the hurricane remains off the North Carolina coast. The storm, which is expected to be Category 2 by this time, will then start to drt left down the coast. It is unclear when or  it will make landfall. Some reports suggest it will remain in the ocean gathering strength by this stage.   Friday 11pm It\u0027s believed the storm will hover off the coast before making landfall. It\u0027s unusual for a hurricane to linger along a coastline and this could bring dire results as parts of the Carolinas could endure hurricane conditions for 24 hours. This will likely be the storm of a letime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that\u0027s saying a lot given the impacts we\u0027ve seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew, the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina said. The service also stressed the potential for “unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm.   Saturday 8am As it approaches the coast, it\u0027s estimated the wind speed will have reduced to less than 100mph. Florence is forecast to approach the South Carolina coast Saturday morning at 8 a.m. The storm could be reduced to a category 2 storm by the time it reaches land but this could result in an increase in rainfall to 40 inches in North Carolina. Florence is forecast to meander inland, slowly into South Carolina and could spend the weekend battering the Carolinas.

Jonathan Garcia, 32, and Vanessa Fernandez Arango, 30, were married in 2016 and immediately wanted to become parents.  After a period of trying without success, they began fertility treatment and, after falling pregnant, Vanessa started to enthusiastically share her experience on Instagram to her followers.  On posting a photo of her positive test for pregnancy, she wrote: The beginning of the end, the beginning of feeling alive, the end of suffering.  Vanessa, from Bilbao in northern Spain, had previously suffered two ectopic pregnancies, after which she said she had lost a little bit of myself, but you can recover from anything, or almost anything. During her pregnancy the couple regularly shared photos of their baby adventure together with fans, offering encouragement to others going through the same process. Before one procedure Vanessa posted a photo of the two dressed for surgery, saying: We couldn\u0027t be more united. Overcoming every obstacle until we reach our goal! We are warriors! And for those of you who haven\u0027t got there yet... you will! However, in the 38th week of pregnancy, events took a terrible turn and Vanessa began to feel unwell at breakfast, and after fainting she was rushed to hospital.  Hours later, to the dismay of her 2,700 followers, Jonathan posted the sad news as a tweet from her account. He wrote: This is Vanessa\u0027s husband. They have carried out an emergency Caesarean. The baby is in intensive care. Vanessa has died. You will understand that this account will now close. Thank you all for making her laugh. Vanessa had suffered a fatal cardiac arrest during surgery, although the baby named Alo had survived and was at first fighting for his le before recovering to a stable condition. The overwhelming reaction from fans of the happy Spanish couple was one of disbelief.

Ruslan Borishov and Alexander Petrov spoke to Russian state TV channel RT yesterday after Met Police said there was enough evidence to charge them with the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.  Despite the accusations against them, the pair claimed they had flown to the UK from Moscow to visit Salisbury Cathedral, staying at a hotel in Bow, east London, but flew home due to poor weather. They said they are the real victims after being accused of poisonings which took place in March.  His puffing and swallowing suggests stress Now, body language expert Judi James has studied footage of their interview, claiming they show signs of nervousness and irritation and could have rehearsed their answers in advance. She said: It\u0027s fair to say that the body language of these two men in this interview is a million miles away from the grinning, smirking rather self-satisfied looking guys we saw on CCTV in Salisbury. Keeping in mind cultural dferences that would have an impact on their body language both men display incongruent-looking signals here, meaning their words and their body language don\u0027t seem to add up. Petrov keeps his hands below the table which can be a useful ploy  you\u0027re trying to hide any \u0027tells\u0027 from the camera.  Although his sideways chair swivel looks like nervousness it can also be prompted by impatience or irritation. Despite his slumped shoulders his power and control signals look quite strong. His blink rate is slow, suggesting calm and at one time he performs nearly five chair turns between blinks. His eye contact with the interviewer is sustained and rather piercing at times and when he does shut his eyes it is in a very emphatic, dominant affirmative reply to a question. Boshirov is clearly the go-to man for a tourists guide to Salisbury and his body language suggests higher levels of anxiety as a result. His breathing looks shallow and his blink rate is faster.

Away from the capital’s brainwashed elite, we found ordinary North Koreans struggling to survive. But we were constantly shadowed by Kim Jong-un’s security agents. The gleaming buildings of \u0026shyPyongyang portray an image of North Korean perfection Kim wants the world to see. Alongside the magnicent tower blocks across the city stand proud \u0026shymonuments of the dictator’s grandad Kim Il-sung and dad Kim Jong-il. Propaganda banners adorn bridges and pavements instructing the people to honour their leaders’ “sacrice” fighting Japanese and US imperialists. But away from the city sparkle lies the true harsh reality of le under the Kims’ twisted version of socialism, where desperate peasant workers carry out backbreaking work and pick crops with their bare hands. And the Mirror was there to witness it after we gained unrivalled access to parts of the secretive country rarely seen by foreigners. During our exclusive eight-day stay we were able to travel more than 100 miles from the capital and saw first hand how the regime rules with an iron grip.  And as Kim showcases his \u0026shydevastating arsenal of military power in a muscle-flexing warning to the West, his ordinary subjects starve. Outside Pyongyang, home to three million of the brainwashed “elite”, lies a desolate countryside where 20 million farm workers scratch out a miserable \u0026shyexistence. Their toil remains the leblood of the nation while regime kingpins enjoy the fruits of their labour. Many millions of acres exist without even the most basic industrial machinery, in a land that claims to be one of the most advanced in the world and boasting of its ability to launch a nuclear attack on its enemies. The vast rivers which should be a bustling avenue of trade are devoid of activity, the scenery occasionally split up by a few labourers breaking rocks on the riverbed. Soldiers regularly survey the \u0026shypeasants’ work leading them to live in fear and act busy when they are near, even  there is nothing to do.  We saw one women pick up a stick and stare at the ground after being reprimanded by an official, a sign of the level of fear that exists in this dystopian dream-like nation. Kim’s nuclear ambitions have further crippled the country as \u0026shystringent sanctions have banned the trade deals it needs to survive. His meeting with US president Donald Trump promised to herald a new beginning for the country, with the despot vowing to dump his nukes and set his country on the path of economic development. And yet, despite the absence of the intercontinental ballistic missiles he has been so keen to show off in previous years, the warped a\u0026shyttitudes show no sign of fading. Western defence officials say North Korea is regularly employing \u0026shy“deceptive tactics to evade UN \u0026shysanctions” and have raised fears that Kim has no desire to deplete his nuclear capability. Satellite imagery of the Sanumdong facility near \u0026shyPyongyang has shown recent signs the regime is building one or possibly two ICBMs – the exact ones Trump wants Kim to give up or face even harsher global penalties.  But it would seem Kim’s loyal subjects stand by him too, which we discovered when at the behest of the regime we attended the incredible 70th anniversary celebrations of the country’s foundation on Sunday. One government official with us smiled broadly when asked  the lack of hardcore weaponry on show meant the regime was backing down to Trump. He said: “The Supreme Leader will never do anything that reduces our position when the threat against us is continual.” The Pyongyang parade involving 300,000 military and civilians was followed by a Mass Games in the world’s largest stadium featuring 100,000 performers, many of them children. It was a sight to behold. This was the best of the best and exactly what 35-year-old Kim and his cronies wanted us to see, believing we too would be convinced of both his and the nation’s power. He attended both events and waved enthusiastically to his subjects, whose deafening roars of support could leave no one in doubt of their devotion to their idol.  Kim’s regime contacted the Mirror after we exposed it for using child slaves to build railway lines in the country’s northern provinces in 2016. Following 18 months of tense \u0026shynegotiations, we managed to secure visas to enter in time for this week’s foundation anniversary. We were assigned senior officials from the Ministry of Information to act as our “guides”. They attempted to convince us of how the pariah state is an all-powerful yet inclusive nation, where everyone lives in “harmony and happiness to serve the country”.  While the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to the country a few thousand people a year can visit North Korea as “tourists”. Comedy actor Michael Palin, 75, next week releases a two-part \u0026shydocumentary that will apparently see him go “beyond the politics” in a bid to discover more about the everyday le of the secretive nation. But travelling with a tour company, like Palin, is unlikely to reveal the darker side to le that still exists.  The lack of free will was evident from the moment we stepped off the plane. We were given “press” armbands, not permitted to leave our hotel without our minders and kept in a constant state of limbo over arrangements for our stay. We would often be kept in the dark for hours and then need to leave at a moment’s notice. A complete ban on advertising, state TV stations dedicated to pumping out propaganda dressed up as news and \u0026shyentertainment, all bolster Kim’s surging popularity and \u0026shycontributes to the desensitisation of the entire \u0026shypopulation.  From as soon as they are able, children are ordered to \u0026shyrepeatedly chant the name of the “Supreme Leader” and devote their lives to serving him and the memory of the “great leaders” Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. This despite them presiding over years of devastating war, famine and isolation. But while the rest of the country struggles to survive, the city folk keep up the pretence of utopia, among the shiny buildings Pyongyang’s tallest is the 105 storey, 330m tall Ryugyong Hotel.

In BBC2’s Trust he suggests victim John Paul Getty III, known as Little Paul, came up with the plan for the kidnap in the first place. This week Little Paul’s we has confirmed for the first time he did discuss such an idea with her in advance of the crime. Gisela Getty said he speculated about his own kidnap, aiming to use the profits to create an arts colony paradise in Marrakech, where LSD would flood the water supply.  Gisela, now 69, admits: “We wanted to do something better with the money than they did – to make a better world, but it got us into very deep waters.” The money “wasn’t to make us rich. It was really to bring our vision into the material world”. This “vision” consisted of 10 “crazy ideas a day” cooked up by Little Paul, Gisela and her twin sister, Jutta Winkelmann. In their hippy world of nightclubs and political demonstrations, Little Paul shared a bed with both of the radical German sisters, known as the “It girls” of Rome, in his “Dungeon” – a squalid basement with no windows. The daughters of a Nazi SS officer, the twins were already famous in their native Germany when they moved to Rome in early 1973. At 23, they were seven years his senior, and the trio envisioned a left-wing utopia. In TV’s Trust, a dferent story is suggested that Little Paul owed money because he had run up drug bills with the Mafia, with him saying in one scene: “You can take me and get the money from my grandfather.” But Gisela maintains that he abandoned his plan, saying: “I think he was taken against his will, against his wishes.”  For four decades Gisela, mother of the actor Balthazar Getty with Little Paul as well as Anna from a previous marriage, has not broken the Getty family’s code of silence. But the death of Jutta from cancer last year and the release of fictional dramas of the story have made her speak out. The first was Ridley Scott’s 2017 film All the Money in the World – for which disgraced Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer, 88, as the miserly John Paul Getty. In interviews since the release of the 10-episode Trust in America earlier this year, Gisela says: “One day Paul said, ‘I have talked to people. I have this idea to let myself be kidnapped and then get a place in Morocco. I am his favourite grandson. It is all going to be a matter of a week or so.’” Gisela says no one, Little Paul included, really took the idea seriously. That was until the Mafia got involved. Little Paul was friendly with the gangsters who kidnapped him, Gisela says, selling paintings in exchange for drugs.  But then Gisela and Jutta’s lives came under threat. They were told by a Mafia boss called Ciambellone he wanted to invest in a film they were making, but he lured them into a trap. The twins were kept for two days by cocaine-fuelled captors. During their ordeal, they were tied up, threatened with rape and strangulation and forced to watch pornography. Ciambellone stabbed himself because Jutta refused to be his mistress. “There was blood all over the floor,” says Gisela, who later had an affair with Dennis Hopper.The twins managed to break free and insisted Little Paul cut all ties with his Mafia “friends”. Weeks later, he vanished. Little Paul had been thrown into the back of a van and put in a cave more than 300 miles south of Rome. The Mafia killed his pet bird and played Russian roulette against his head when a ransom note was rejected by his grandfather, who despite being worth 2billion had payphones for guests at his Surrey mansion. “I have 14 grandchildren,” he said. “If I pay a penny I’ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren.”  He suspected the plot was about Little Paul trying to extort money from him. Meanwhile, the victim’s father was desperately trying to get the ransom together. Then, in November 1973, a torn, bloody ear was sent to a newspaper. A letter read: “This is Paul’s first ear. If within 10 days the family still believes that this is a joke mounted by him, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.” He developed pneumonia after what was left of his injured ear became infected. His grandad eventually stumped up the cash but only as much as was tax deductible, lending a further 1million to his son Big Paul, John Paul’s father – as long as he repaid it plus 4% interest. Gisela says Little Paul, a “lovely naive boy”, never fully recovered from the “tragic experience” which left him physically and emotionally scarred. The ear in the post “was so terrying, beyond words”, she says. “It was the cruellest and most unimaginable thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tragic cyclops baby born one","story":"NewsTragic \u0027cyclops\u0027 baby born with one eye after mum was \u0027exposed to mercury during pregnancy\u0027WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: The child weighed just 5lbs after being born at the Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah Hospital in North Sumatra and sadly died just hours laterShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTaniya DuttaNeil Murphy13:33, 14 SEP 2018Updated14:07, 14 SEP 2018NewsThe parents were reportedly traumatised by the child\u0027s birth \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email An Indonesian woman shocked doctors when she gave birth to a \u0027cyclops\u0027 baby with one eye - but sadly lost her seven hours later.

hall","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCulture chiefs want to follow up the success of the V\u0026ampA museum by opening a multi-million-pound concert venue and conference centre in the city.Dundee Technology Park on the west side of the city is one of the council\u0026#8217s earmarked locations for the facility.Dundee City Council has held talks with prospective private sector partners about a 6,000 capacity arena, to consolidate the city’s growing reputation as a cultural destination.The local authority’s executive director of city development Mike Galloway said it was vital to maintain the momentum generated by the opening of the V\u0026ampA.“The important thing is whether we can get a facility like this from the private sector or is it a facility that needs huge pump-priming from the public sector,” he said.“If it is the latter, it will be dficult to do at this point in time.“We’d rather have a private sector and we’re talking to a few people who could do something commercial with music events and the conference market.”Council leader John Alexander said the authority was “actively” working on proposals.Asked about potential locations, he said: “If you’ve got the vision, you can deliver it in a number of locations.“It could be along the Waterfront or it could be on the outskirts of the city – the technology park is a potential venue.“There are a number of dferent areas in the city that are either vacant or with enough vision could deliver something of that magnitude.”There are still several sites available in the city’s £1 billion regeneration programme.They include District 10 at Seabraes, and Site 12 and Site 17 along the Waterfront, although those areas are currently reserved predominantly for commercial, retail and restaurant use.Craig McLaren, director of the Royal Town Planning Institute Scotland, suggested the most likely location for such a venue would be the city centre.“A key thing to consider is accessibility to a building like that,” he said.“You need good public transport links such as bus stops and train stations to encourage as many people as possible to take public transport.“Every city is dferent and each project has dferent implications but you will always need to think about the environmental impact and the impact on people living close to the development.“Of course, some people are always going to drive a car but with these sorts of venues a lot of the events happen in the evening, so there will be more spaces at city car parks a short distance away.“That’s why you find a lot of these things in city centre locations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/V_A-Dundee_Scotland_©HuftonCrow_082-588x564.jpg ","title":"french journalist says dundee is very well

Japanese architect.He said: “We’re here because of Kengo Kuma’s involvement and we want to announce the museum to Japanese people.“We hope our broadcasts will encourage Japanese visitors to come to Dundee.“This museum has captured global interest. That’s why we’re here.”Tristan De Bourbon Parme from Le Journal des Arts in Paris said the museum had surpassed expectations.“There was a perception that it would be an extension of the V\u0026ampA in London but now I understand that is not the case, and that this is a signicant museum in its own right,” he said.“I’m sure this is going to draw visitors from all over the world.“It is an amazing asset for Dundee to have. It will surely become a major tourist attraction and I can definitely see people from France coming to visit.“Dundee has become very well known on the international stage recently and there’s no doubt the museum has played a major part in that.“I’ve been in Dundee a couple of times before and each time I come I see another change and development.”If the shape of the outside of the museum is dficult for people to get their heads around, the inside is even more mind-boggling.The walls are lined with wood panels, in stark contrast to the concrete exterior, and the floor is made of Irish limestone.There are thousands of fossilised remains set in the stone, in a further nod to Kuma’s love of the natural world. 100vw, 580px\" /But just like the outside, the interior building twists and turns as you walk through it, with not one straight wall in sight.As you make your way from the entrance, which is virtually hidden at the far end of the building, into the main reception area, the building opens up – and a grand staircase takes you up to the vast exhibition spaces.Speaking at the unveiling of his masterpiece, Kuma said: “I am truly in love with the Scottish landscape and nature – I was inspired by the clfs of north east Scotland.“I hope the museum can change the city and become its centre of gravity.”Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “This building has made a signicant impact on Dundee even before it has opened.“It signies a renewed confidence, a renewed pride and a fire in the belly.“For too long our city has been seen as a poor relation but that is changing.“The people of Dundee have bought into the cultural led regeneration and they see this building as theirs.”Following the visits by journalists, a select group of people – who won competitions run by DC Thomson, including the Evening  – will become the first members of the public to get inside the museum on Friday for an exclusive tour.Then on Saturday the building opens up fully, with those who were successful in securing tickets becoming the first official visitors to the attraction.Sunday is also ticket-only, before the free-to-enter museum begins normal operations on Monday – though visitors will have to pay for certain exhibitions.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see  I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that,  I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and,  an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/09/KMIL1938.JPG-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"live blog excitement builds ahead of 3d festival concert to mark va dundee opening","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMembers of the public are seeing inside V\u0026ampA Dundee for the first time, ahead of the 3D Festival tonight.Community groups and competition winners are enjoying a look at Dundee\u0026#8217s new design museum.Primal Scream will headline the show tonight.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9a30ecdfc3a.jpg ","title":"new home needed for huge hand drawn aerial drawing of dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe team behind a huge aerial drawing of Dundee is on the hunt for a new home for the breathtaking work of art.London-based artist Carl Lavia, also known as Sketch, created the three-yard wide piece using ballpoint pens throughout last year and put it on show at The McManus in February.However, Carl and project manager Lorna Le Bredonchel are now looking for somewhere new to display the drawing, as their deal with The McManus is set to expire.Carl said he, Lorna and Balhousie Care boss Tony Banks – who bought the drawing for an undisclosed sum – are anxious to find a new permanent home for it as soon as possible.“Tony got in contact with Lorna and asked  she could find an alternative display space in Dundee,” said Carl.“She found one but this place can only display the artwork for one month.“Lorna and I would like to help the owner keep the artwork on public display in the city.“If no space is found, it will simply leave The McManus and be installed in a private space.“We would dearly like the piece to be kept on a wall where everyone can enjoy it.”Mr Banks, who has spoken about his desire to keep the work on display in the past, said: “My views have not changed since I bought the sketch, as it is so unique and original.“It is important that as many people as possible get the opportunity to view it.”Carl’s Dundee artwork depicts the city centre and landmarks such as Slessor Gardens, the V\u0026ampA, the Law and DC Thomson’s Meadowside building.In all, it shows about six miles of Dundee – and it captured the city’s imagination when it went on display.Leisure and Culture Dundee put the completed work on show at The McManus with an agreement to keep it there for six months.

of fraser fyvie provides fizz as youthful dundee united exit irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most signicant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited  from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the dference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he s to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his  capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Dundee-council-road-closures-VA-2-397x564.jpg ","title":"severe delays coming in to dundee due to city

the north","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs the early-season jockeying for position continues in a Championship that’s, so far, living up to predictions it will be the tightest for years, Dundee United can do themselves a lot of good by winning their next two games.Even  the last league outing ended in the minor disappointment of a draw at Alloa, there’s no denying, since their early-campaign troubles in the Betfred Cup, the past few weeks have seen the Tangerines show steady signs of improvement.The last three outings have produced two wins plus that draw and, in a ision where after just four rounds of fixtures only one team, Inverness Caley Thistle, remains unbeaten, that can be put down as a decent run of form.And,  United can extend that to five games without loss via victories over Morton at Tannadice this Saturday and at Falkirk a week later, there’s every chance they’ll be the form team in the second tier.If that is so, it would be a case of good timing because at least two of the three games that will follow could prove to be among the most crucial of the campaign.That run will see them come up against both Inverness and Ross County and, as tight as the table looks just now, it is signicant the Highland pair currently occupy the top two positions.Coming down from the Premiership and with the backing of mega-rich owner Roy McGregor, County were always expected to mount a strong challenge to  to the top flight.It’s been a case of so far so good, though they did go down 2-1 at Morton last time out in the league.And before arriving at Tannadice on the 29th of this month, their quality will be further tested by a visit to in-form Queen of the South this weekend and a derby against Inverness the following week.That the team from the Highland capital are also looking strong will come as no surprise to those who know the Championship.Although they didn’t even make the promotion play-offs last term, many at that level felt between Christmas and the end of the season Caley were the strongest of the 10 teams.They’re coming to Tannadice in just over a month, almost exactly a year to the day since their impressive victory would mark the end of Ray McKinnon’s time in charge of the home team. While a win for Caley this time is unlikely to produce the same course of events with current United boss Csaba Laszlo, it would be a major blow to his hopes of guiding the team to promotion.Sandwiched between those encounters with the teams from the far north, will be a trip to Ayr United and old boss Ian McCall.Long since recovered from a dficult period at Tannadice, over the past three years he’s worked wonders at Somerset Park, twice winning promotion to this level.His team were on fire at the start of the season, most notably when they headed for Dens Park in the Betfred Cup and destroyed Dundee 3-0.The Honest Men’s last league outing saw them come back down to earth with a bump as they crashed at Queen of the South in a 5-0 beating that included a 10-minute first-half hat-trick from Steven Dobbie.Over the next couple of weeks, it will be interesting to see  that was no more than a blip or an indication Ayr have been punching above their weight so far and, over the course of the season, will settle into their expected role of simply battling to stay in the ision.Whichever is the case, United will not expect anything they bring home from the southwest to come easy but,  it’s part of a haul of points from an extended good run, it will bode well for the remainder of the season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie

I’m concentrating on helping Peterhead do well and getting myself a bit of form, those are the main reasons behind it.”Peterhead boss McInally is delighted to have signed Dow and believes the move can benefit the player and the club.He said: “The family connection has helped and is a big factor because that’s partly why he’s been at Peterhead games.“But at the end of the day  he orced my daughter I would still want to sign him.“But there have been other factors. Simon Ferry spoke to him and told him that he would enjoy his football with us.“Ryan has had a really good pre-season and he wants to benefit from that with us. He doesn’t feel coming on as a sub is what he wanted to do. He’s putting his neck on the line a bit by wanting to show people that he can play.“If his spell with us does kick-start his career we will massively benefit from that.“If he plays as he can then he will do really well for us at this level.“He’ll hopefully bring the creativity and a bit of pace to our team. He dribbles well and he has a good football brain so he will bring a lot to us.“From the club’s point of view, we got lucky to a certain extent that he knows our set-up because he spoke to three or four other teams.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a leline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What are your views on improving these?DM: \u0026#8216Obviously these are vitally important for rural areas. What Argyll and Bute Council wants to do as part of the Rural Growth Deal is to have the highest possible broadband speeds.\u0026#8216You are not going to get people to live in or visit rural areas  they don\u0026#8217t get the level of connectivity they are accustomed to. It is right at the centre of the consideration in this deal and I am very supportive of it.\u0026#8217AA: Another potential obstacle to economic development in Argyll and Bute is transport links, given the region\u0026#8217s unique geography. Would you support the development of fixed links such as tunnels and bridges for this area?DM: \u0026#8216These are much more a matter for the Scottish Government, as roads and transport are devolved, but it\u0026#8217s self-evident that to get products such as seafood to market quickly you need to have those transport links.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m sure the council will be pitching to the Scottish Government to have those transport links improved. I also think it is worth looking at how other island communities deal with these sort of problems.\u0026#8217AA: Would Westminster support such projects financially after Brexit?DM: \u0026#8216Up until the point we\u0026#8217ve formally left the EU, all funding arrangements are guaranteed. Beyond that we will be looking to put in place the \u0026#8216Shared Prosperity Fund\u0026#8217, which will be the equivalent of EU structural and other funding.\u0026#8216We will shortly be consulting on the form the Shared Prosperity Fund should take.\u0026#8217AA: RBS has threatened to close its Inveraray branch, having already closed branches in dozens of other towns including Campbeltown and Rothesay since the turn of the year. What are your thoughts on this, from a UK government perspective?DM: \u0026#8216The first thing to say is that it isn\u0026#8217t possible, contrary to what some people have suggested, for the government to tell RBS what to do. While the government is a shareholder, it is not running RBS.\u0026#8216My own view is that the approach of RBS over these branch closures demonstrates that they do not place any importance on serving rural Scotland. I have encouraged people to play a full part in the consultations over threatened branches.\u0026#8216I do think we have to be very alive to the wider issues about people being able to get access to cash in rural areas. That\u0026#8217s something the government is very cogniscant of.\u0026#8216RBS have demonstrated no commitment to rural areas and that is very disappointing.\u0026#8217AA: Is Scotland ready for Brexit?DM: \u0026#8216I hope so. What we\u0026#8217re trying to do in relation to Brexit is get the best possible deal, and I still believe it\u0026#8217s possible to get a deal.\u0026#8216I want to see everyone rallying around the Prime Minister and her proposal, which meets the needs of Scotland by continuing to have close trading links with the EU whilst ensuring that we do, in fact, leave in acordance with peoples\u0026#8217 wishes in the referendum.\u0026#8216It will ensure that we leave the Common Fisheries Policy and Common Agricultural Policy \u0026#8211  but have that trading relationship with the EU.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"feorlins bake sale for nannie meg","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/09/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNine-year-old Feorlin Renton\u0026#8217s coffee morning was a great success, raising more than £750 for Macmillan Cancer Support.The Inveraray Primary School pupil ran and hosted a coffee morning in Nicoll Hall in memory of her grandma.Feorlin said: ‘Three years ago my Nannie passed away.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car.

It is a place precious to many who come to seek solitude and appreciate the remote and beautul landscape. It is impossible to mitigate the visual impact. Its presence alone would remove the wilderness and scenic qualities valued by many.\u0026#8217The area is designated ‘Wild Land’ and ‘Area of Panoramic Quality’ and lies within the Inner Hebrides and The Minches Special Area of Conservation , she said, and is \u0026#8216rich in rare wildle\u0026#8217, such as harbour porpoises, dolphins, and minke, killer and sei whales.\u0026#8216The plan shows Acoustic Deterrent Devices  would be used to deter seals. Cetaceans can be displaced by ADDs at ranges of 7km. The cumulative impact will be devastating to these species.\u0026#8216Impacts from lice, disease, pesticides and waste, to not only wild fish, but other marine le is unacceptable. The estates on Islay and Jura work hard to conserve and enhance their local native populations.\u0026#8216The proposal is flawed: there has been no consideration to the exposed nature of the site and the high potential for escaped stock and mooring instability of the cages.\u0026#8216There has been no hydrodynamic modelling, no benthic  biology survey submitted, maximum stocking biomass has been increased to levels for which further investigations are needed and fallow periods are unsustainably short. Impacts to other wildle have not been considered.\u0026#8216A promise of six jobs, whilst sacricing a rare wild landscape and unspoiled marine habitats, is not appropriate nor sustainable economic development.\u0026#8217Stuart Cannon, managing director of Kames Fish Farming Limited, said it is \u0026#8216an environmentally responsible company which has produced high quality, sustainable fish for more than 45 years.\u0026#8216We are very much aware there is a balance to be struck, and would not want to place a site where there would be risk to the amazing bioersity we have on the west coast.\u0026#8216We have withdrawn applications in the past where the scientic assessment of the site has suggested the site is not suitable.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13243376.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_260418funky.jpg","title":"ayrshire clubbers could tv club","story":"NewsAyrshire clubbers could be on TV with Club MTV filmingMTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet11:58, 14 SEP 2018NewsFurys nighclub in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailClubbers in Ayrshire will have the chance to show off their moves to the world.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her le now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a orced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no le, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my le was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horric surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building. It depresses me, but I can\u0026rsquot see any other option but to approve this as pretty much all options have been reasonably explored, so it\u0026rsquos with a heavy heart that I vote with the officer\u0026rsquos recommendation.\nGalashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison also supported the recommendation to allow the demolition but said he would be sad to see it go, adding: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a huge emotional issue in terms of buildings and things which are of historic signicance.\n\u0026ldquoI worry about the future of built environments. Take our capital city for example. There are some huge historical buildings, and the upkeep of these buildings is hugely expensive.\n\u0026ldquoWhat are we going to do with them? They can\u0026rsquot all be Wetherspoons.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a sad reflection of society that many have gone that way. I prefer to see it demolished rather than see it degraded, and that\u0026rsquos a sad thing to say.\n\u0026ldquoI just want to stop the continuous pain of it degrading and just see it go, so I\u0026rsquom happy to support the demolition, but it is tinged with regret and sadness.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pop-up-bobs-are-putting-brakes-on-borders-speedsters","story":"POP-UP \u0026lsquoBobs\u0026rsquo are helping improve road safety in the Borders, according to police chiefs.\nSince the start of the year, cardboard cut outs of officers have been deployed in speeding hotspots around the region.\nAnd bosses at Police Scotland say they are having a positive impact.\nSpeaking at Friday\u0026rsquos meeting of the Police, Fire and Rescue and Safer Communities Board, Chief Inspector Andy McLean said: \u0026ldquoRoad safety is an issue which is very close to my heart.\n\u0026ldquoWe have a number of projects in place to help make our roads safer.\n\u0026ldquoThe uptake in the Drivewise scheme has been signicant, which is great because it helps people improve their driving skills.\n\u0026ldquoThe pop-up Bobs have also been very well received.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service .\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of le, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots. It was answered and delivered by these two brave and ambitious local ladies, who with the community at heart, saved Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Post Office.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"photos-group-of-flamingo-chicks-hatch-in-oxton","story":"A GROUP of flamingo chicks have hatched at a Borders conservation centre.\nNews of the arrival of the Chilean flamingo flock was confirmed by Bird Gardens Scotland.\nThe newborns\u0026nbspwill form part of a new visitor attraction in Oxton, near Lauder.\nThe chicks hatched from eggs laid by the established Chilean flamingo flock at Chester Zoo.\nThe flock at Chester had a breeding success earlier in the summer, leading to a number of surplus eggs.\nThe eggs in question were incubated by the Bird Section in Chester prior to being carefully transported to Bird Gardens Scotland in Oxton, to hatch.\nIts not been confirmed how many chicks there are.\nFollowing on from hatching, the eggs will take 30 days to develop into healthy flamingo chicks, also known as flaminglings.\nMark Haillay of Bird Gardens Scotland said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos an incredible moment when you first hear a flamingo egg grunt at you and you know that within 48 hours there will be a chick asleep, resting after its epic journey from inside the egg out into the world.\nLike many other types of bird, flaminglings have an egg-tooth on the tip of their beak which they use to gradually scratch and chip away at the shell creating an opening large enough for them to wriggle free of the shell and out into the world.\nThe flaminglings will be hand reared in Oxton, fed every two hours round the clock with a specialist liquidised diet fed through a syringe.\nThis mimics the beak-to-beak feeding which would occur in parent reared birds parent flamingos produce a rich saliva  and dribble this into the chick\u0026rsquos beak providing all the water, nutrients and energy they need to grow and stay healthy.\nMark added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos incredibly exciting to think these little balls of grey fluff will grow to be majestic flamingos.

the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his family le and his day-to-day dealings with the public in a series of diaries.\nIn 2014, some 40 of Dr Muir\u0026rsquos diaries were presented by his descendants to the Scottish Borders Archive

early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer  members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again ening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel dferent and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real dficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.

However, after a break from swimming she ed to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that le is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing  we measure it by days passed.  Yet  we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long le, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of le. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo le shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our le.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my le \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as  it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautul warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your le, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnicent and beautul? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in dferent ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered  everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I ed I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautul or special.  We can pepper our daily le with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you  ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"deal-over-land-for-new-prestonpans-cemetery-in-final-stages","story":"  The local authority has confirmed it is close to securing a deal for land in the town to ease the pressure on Prestonpans Cemetery, which is nearly full.

They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

Solicitor Jamie Baxter, defending, said: \"He has held employment with Glasgow City Council as a driver for children with special needs for 19 years.  \"As a consequence of this it is likely that his job will be terminated. He is already suspended and subject to an ongoing investigation.\"  Sherf Gillian Wade, who found McIntosh guilty of assault after a trial, fined him \u0026pound750.  She told him: \"It was a most unfortunate incident to have taken place and you are now suffering the consequences of having a conviction for assault on your record.  \"This will be very much felt by yourself. It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My we Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my we woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My we was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans ing from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"snps-ian-blackford-signals-decision-on-indyref2-not-in-october-but-by-end-of-year","story":"  The SNP\u0027s Westminster leader made clear it would be \u0026ldquopresumptuous to set out a definitive position until the terms of any Brexit deal were known.  This means that Nicola Sturgeon will not be in a position at next month\u0026rsquos SNP conference to give a clear view on Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional future because the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will still be unknown.  This is likely to disappoint many Nationalists, including those who this weekend will gather in Glasgow for a Hope over Fear Yes rally.  The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos future agenda, published last week, stated: \u0026ldquoAt the end of the period of negotiation with the EU, and when the terms of Brexit are clearer, we will set out our judgement on the best way forward for Scotland at that time, including our view on the precise timescale for offering people a choice over the country\u0026rsquos future.  It is widely thought that any deal with Brussels will now not be sealed at the October 18/19 European Council but could come at a special summit pencilled in for November 13.  This will be followed by ratication by parliaments across the EU as well as the so-called \"meaningful vote\" at Westminster on the final deal, possibly before Christmas.  However, Mr Blackford was clear that, as the informed debate on the economics of independence continued following the publication of the Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report, no decision on when or whether to call for a second independence vote could be made until after the details of a deal were fully known.  He told reporters at a Westminster briefing: \u0026ldquoThe judgement we have made is we can reflect on what the options are for Scotland once we know the Brexit outcome. Now, some time ago there was an expectation that would happen in October but that is probably unlikely in October\u0026hellipIt will be presumptuous of us to give an outline of what we will do until we know what the Brexit destination is.  \u0026ldquoThere has to be clarity. You can\u0026rsquot do it in a vacuum\u0026hellipWe have to be clear what the outcome is going to be\u0026hellipWe will know by the end of the year.  When it was suggested that the First Minister would, therefore, not announce anything definitive at conference, the Highland MP replied: \u0026ldquoI understand why people in the SNP and the wider Yes movement, perhaps more widely than Scotland, want to know what the future opportunities will be for having a debate and a formal decision on Scotland\u0026rsquos constitutional future.  \u0026ldquoI am grateful there is now an informed debate which is taking place on some of the economics of the question of Scottish independence, let\u0026rsquos continue that debate and that debate can be informed of the circumstances that we know Scotland will be in post-Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"russians-claiming-to-be-salisbury-suspects-say-they-were-just-tourists","story":"  The men, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, appeared on the Russia state-funded RT channel and resembled the suspects shown on CCTV stills, which were released by police investigating the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, the former Russian spy, and his daughter Yulia.  They claimed they were now victims and were in fear of their lives.  Petrov said: \u0026ldquoOur friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town.  He went on: \"Well, we went there on March 2, then went to a railway station to see the timetable. We arrived in Salisbury on March 3 and tried to walk through the town but we lasted for only half an hour because it was covered in snow.  \"Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn\u0027t do it because there was muddy slush everywhere.

We got wet, took the nearest train and came back [to London].\"  Boshirov said: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos the famous Salisbury Cathedral, famous not just in Europe, but in the whole world. It\u0026rsquos famous for its 123-metre spire, it\u0026rsquos famous for its clock, the first one[of its kind] ever created in the world, which is still working.  \"We spent no more than an hour in Salisbury, mainly because of the lags between trains.

When asked by RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan whether they had a counterfeit bottle of designer perfume, which the police said contained the nerve agent, Borishov replied: \"Is it silly for decent lads to have women\u0027s perfume? The customs are checking everything, they would have questions as to why men have women\u0027s perfume in their luggage. We didn\u0027t have it.\"  The men\u0026rsquos comments were published on RT\u0026rsquos webpage. The station said it would air more of the interview later. Ms Simonyan made clear the two men, \u0026ldquothe real  Petrov and Boshirov, had contacted her offering an interview.  On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin called for the two men to speak with the media during an economic conference in Vlaostok. The Russian President insisted they were innocent and \u0026ldquocivilians, contradicting accusations by Scotland Yard that they were agents of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, which Mr Skripal used to be a member of.  Asked about the RT interview, Downing St declined to give any new comment.  Detectives believe it is likely the two Salisbury suspects, thought to be aged around 40, travelled under aliases and that Petrov and Boshirov are not their real names.  Officers formally linked the attack on the Skripals to events in nearby Amesbury where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, were exposed to the same nerve agent.  Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July, just over a week after the pair fell ill.  A police officer who visited the home of the Skripals shortly after the attack, Nick Bailey, was also left critically ill from exposure to the substance."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8679116.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-minister-determined-to-improve-faltering-lifeline-ferry-services-to-scotlands-islands","story":"  Concerns about ferry services resurfaced after it emerged journeys\u0026nbspto and from Arran are to be disrupted till Sunday after one of the two vessels that cover the route was suddenly withdrawn from service while the other suffered ramp damage.

As a result, all sailings operated by the MV Isle of Arran were cancelled from Tuesday to Sunday inclusive.  Around half of the timetable services between Ardrossan and Brodick will now be running.

Ministers listened in silence as he outlined how inflation and interest rates would rise while unemployment would more than double.  One source at the meeting said: \u0026ldquoAll of the predictions were grim and the numbers were chilling.  Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake, on behalf of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: \u0026ldquoWe are facing a Brexit no-deal house price collapse.  \"The Conservatives used to be the party of the property owning democracy now that epithet lies in tatters as they are the party of hard Brexit and economic disaster.  The deeply gloomy forecast by Mr Carney, dubbed the \u0026ldquohigh priest of Project Fear by Brexiteers, is certain to be rubbished by the pro-Brexit faction.  It came as the latest tranche of technical notices released by Whitehall threw up the prospect of more hard impacts from a no-deal.  These included:  *British motorists face having to get new driving licences to drive across Europe  *travellers with passports close to the expiry date might be denied entry to the EU and  *free mobile phone data roaming on the continent \"could no longer be guaranteed\"  the UK crashed out of the European bloc.  Meanwhile, Nathalie Loiseau, the French Europe Minister, warned planes and Eurostar trains from the UK could be turned back in the event of a no-deal Brexit a claim played down by Downing Street.  Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Constitutional Affairs Secretary, emerged from yet another meeting with UK Government ministers on Brexit, saying that a no-deal was \u0026ldquounthinkable given the \u0026ldquoabsolute chaos that would ensue and warned that it was now threatening to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  \"There is a real problem in the time, effort and resource it\u0027s absorbing and, of course, there is a danger that becomes self-fulfilling. Organisations and businesses are preparing for a no-deal.  \"If the momentum behind that were to continue to increase, then it might just happen. It needs to be ruled out,\" he declared.  The Argyll and Bute MSP said the technical notices laid bare the \u0026ldquocrippling costs and needless red tape a no-deal scenario would bring.  He added: \"A no-deal Brexit should be unthinkable, which is why it should be ruled out,  necessary by extending the Article 50 process.\"  David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, who also attended the Joint Ministerial Committee, said Mr Russell\u0026rsquos warning of a self-fulfilling prophecy about a no-deal was an \u0026ldquointeresting insight into his own psyche.  He explained: \u0026ldquoIt probably gives us an understanding as to why there is so much talk about independence by the SNP and the Scottish Government  they believe just the volume of activity creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is most definitely not the case.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just behaving in a responsible way as the timescale moves ever closer to the point at which we will leave the EU. We had hoped we would have reached a conclusion to the process at the October Council, it looks as  that will go on until November, which would be another month closer to March 29.  \u0026ldquoThese are just responsible actions, declared Mr Mundell, stressing: \u0026ldquoThey are not the level of action compared to the effort we are putting in to get the deal.  The raft of technical notices was published after the Scottish Secretary joined his senior colleagues for a three-hour no-deal Cabinet, chaired by Theresa May, which ran through the preparations for a no-deal.  But the CBI warned the notices showed firms would be \u0026ldquohit with a sledgehammer  there were a no-deal and underlined the extent of disruption consumers could expect  \"ideology wins over evidence\".  \"Then, attention can turn to the vital task of finalising our future economic relationship with the EU,\" she added.  Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that key questions remained unanswered.  Elsewhere, Moody\u0026rsquos credit ratings agency in a report forecast that Britain would fall into recession, the pound would collapse and shop prices would rocket in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  \"We still think the UK and the EU will eventually reach an agreement to preserve many - but not all - of their current trading arrangements, particularly around trade in goods,\" said Colin Ellis, Moody\u0027s chief credit officer and co-author of the report.  \"However, the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without any agreement has risen materially,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-technical-notices-main-points","story":"  The declaration came after Whitehall released another tranche of 28 technical notices on what might happen  Britain crashed out of the EU without an agreement.

We then found that SNP political advisors, paid for by the taxpayer, were neutering these answers.  \u0026ldquoAll this must be swept away.

So, my coffee was lost for want of a 2p piece.  I did eight years\u0027 labour in a coffee shop and I can tell you this much, I would have made the 2p up.  \u0026ldquoJobsworth, I whined to the taxi driver, all the way back to work in a funk.  My barista jobsworth absolutely pales in comparison to the hard graft put in by a manager of a Toby Carvery who denied a terminally ill woman a small plate.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos right. The rules of a chain roast dinner restaurant are sacrosanct. One must take what one is given and be glad, even when one is dying.  A woman in Merseyside visited her local Toby Carvery and asked for a child\u0026rsquos plate. Lynn Deer has terminal stomach cancer, resulting in most of the organ being removed. She hasn\u0026rsquot, you\u0026rsquoll sympathise, much of an appetite.  Child\u0026rsquos plates are for the under-12s and there will be no exceptions. She tried to show the manager a medical card but the lady in charge was not for turning. I tell you what, I didn\u0026rsquot expect to spend my Wednesday afternoon in a minor Twitter spat with Toby Carvery but the chain\u0026rsquos pathetic, mealy-mouthed non-apology left me seeing red. They appreciate my feedback.  Jobsworths are the scourge of polite society. What can we do about them?  In this instance, staff cannot be taught empathy but they can have disability awareness drummed into them, so let\u0026rsquos hope\u0026nbspsome staff training is afoot.  Good customer service matters so much because bad service is to steal someone\u0026rsquos time. It\u0026rsquos a mini manslaughter \u0026ndash who among us has time to give away? You are taking a little piece of someone else\u0026rsquos le.  Ma Stewart was a bit stressed about catching her train the other week and, because of her hearing loss, didn\u0026rsquot realise she was shouting at the station staff member.  Instead of taking umbrage, the ScotRail worker helped her through the barrier, turned to me and said, \u0026ldquoYou go with her, allowing me on to the platform without a ticket and without me having even asked.  What a dference it made, that small, thoughtful gesture.  We have an increasingly elderly population, a society that is increasingly moving online. It seems odd to me that my older neighbour won\u0026rsquot set up a direct debit for his council tax but, on reflection, it\u0026rsquos a day out to pay it in person with guaranteed human interaction.  Imagine that you\u0026rsquore a person\u0026rsquos only face-to-face connection that day and you make them feel bad, you rattle them, you deprive them of something they were excited for.  This all resonates so much because I was once that jobsworth. Back in my coffee shop days, while I\u0026rsquod have let you off with coppers, I was as compliant with company policy as they come.  We\u0026rsquod been told not to give cream in coffee because it curdled. I mean, it doesn\u0026rsquot, does it? But what I was told, I believed.  Every morning the back of 6am a taxi driver would come in for his coffee with cream. Would I give him it? Would I coco.  When he insisted, I would give him a cup with an 80/20 split \u0026ndash in favour of the cream.  I shudder now to think of how he must have dreaded to see me. An irritating little madam setting his day off to a tense and fat-laden start. I am filled with shame.  I saw him not that long ago on Sauchiehall Street and wanted to chase after him to apologise. Of course, that would have been awkward for him and serve only selfish me.  So what changed? Maturity, mainly. But for many jobsworths, age is no excuse.  How to encourage everyday kindness to strangers? I think it starts small and spreads, as mawkish as that may sound. Send it out in waves, each little act at a time.  But it\u0026rsquos vital to go in at the top. Our current insecure labour market does nothing for the discouragement of jobsworths. The pressure is twofold:  your work is precarious, why care? And  you\u0026rsquore at risk of a short term contract being renewed, there\u0026rsquos no incentive to risk using your initiative and overriding company policy.  So, be kind, complain and compliment. Be kind to staff but complain furiously to companies that implement ridiculous policies. And compliment where a job\u0026rsquos well done.

Mr McEwan is alleged to have \"withheld information\" from the influential Treasury Select Committee when he denied that he was aware of any criminal activity within the bank by its workers.  Police Scotland are investigating criminal allegations in relations to a former employee of its RBS Restructuring unit.  Mr McEwan has now defended his comments in a letter to Treasury Committee chairman Nicky Morgan, claiming the activities in question fell outside the period under discussion at the Committee\u0027s January hearing, which related to the now-defunct Global Restructuring Group .  RBS\u0027 Global Restructuring Group  has been accused of pushing firms towards failure in the hope of picking up assets on the cheap, but was left off the hook in a recent ruling by the regulator.  The criminal activity being probed by police is said to have taken place between 2014 and 2016.  Mr McEwan said: \"We would entirely reject the suggestion that the Committee may have been in any way misled by the evidence that I gave during my appearance before you in January.\"  But Ms Morgan said his explanation was \"unconvincing\".  She said: \"When asked in January  he was aware of any criminal activity at GRG, Mr McEwan withheld information of relevance and interest to the Committee.  \"His letter to me implies that this was not inadvertent, but because he considered that the criminal allegations and police investigation in question were not related to the subject matter of the Committee\u0027s session.  \"The Committee is unconvinced by that explanation. It expects clarity and openness from witnesses, and Mr McEwan\u0027s evidence fell short of that standard.\"  She also hit out at the tone of the RBS chief executive\u0027s letter saying the Committee is \"concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair.\"  She added: \"Mr McEwan\u0027s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS\u0027 culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.\"  He could now be hauled back to Parliament to face MPs.  Ms Morgan said: \"If the Committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him.\"  Anyone seen to be lying in evidence to a select committee could face a substantial fine or imprisonment, though it has rarely been enforced.  Mr McEwan said he was \"disappointed\" by the Committee\u0027s response.  He said: \"It is obviously of the utmost importance to me that the Committee is confident that it can rely on the accuracy of my evidence.  \"I replied to the Committee\u0027s questions in good faith and claried my position in writing.  \"I am confident that when the legal process has run its course, this will be seen to be a unique case.  \"There continue to be clear constraints as to what can be disclosed as we would not want to prejudice an ongoing police investigation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-closing-in-on-brexit-deal-with-brussels-suggests-raab","story":"  The Brexit Secretary issued a statement following an \u0026ldquoextended phone call this morning with Michel Barnier about the latest progress both sides\u0026rsquo teams had made on the Withdrawal Agreement and the framework for the future relationship.  \"While there remain some substantive dferences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship, said Mr Raab.  \"Looking ahead, we agreed to review the state of play in the negotiations following the informal meeting of heads of state or government of the European Union in Salzburg next Thursday, and we reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion.

In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.

VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most erse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural signicance and interest.

It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new le.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the dference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gt that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a le free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gt – enjoying le to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive dference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new le basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gt.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my le and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gt.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"temporary closure for post office","story":"        Kemnay Post Office will close temporarily from the start of next month.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 14 Sep 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Friday 14 Sep 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously dficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business. The support and encouragement I have received from the team has really helped me to progress my business.\"\u0026nbspTo enter, apply online at www.createhighland by October 31.Friday 14 Sep 2018 2:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Friday 14 Sep 2018 2:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautul, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the dference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Friday 14 Sep 2018 2:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

The Milnfua Rt Raft crew took third place.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what,  any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment ing from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza .

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634555.1536848138!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n            \n                                      \t   \nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,             imgUrl = wrapper.find.data           \u0027                 .                                \n\t        \n            \n                      \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    St Mary\u0026rsquos say goodbye to Mr Timothy Doyle                \n            \n            \n                \n\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n            \n                                        \t\nNews\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                                                \n                    \n            \n        \n                                        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n                    \n                \n                    Education Authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols                \n            \n            \n                \n\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland  to school in the coming days.\n            \n                                        \t\nEducation\n                                              \n                    \n\n        \n\n\n    ,                    imgUrl = wrapper.find.data              \u0027                        .                        .                                                \n                \n                        \n                                              \n            \n                                  \n                                    \n                    \n            \n        , Sinead Sweeney  Jack Rice , Christopher Beattie , Amy Gray    and Shannon Ferguson  have all been selected to take part in prestigious British Council programme, and will spend a year studying business in the USA.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

mary s say goodbye to mr timothy doyle","story":"\nSt Mary\u0026#8217s Primary School, Banbridge, was shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of their much esteemed colleague and friend, Mr Timothy Doyle. \n\n                \nTimothy dedicated 30 years of his le to the teaching profession and shared his expertise and knowledge with pupils, teachers and parents.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe had a passion for Mathematics and imparted a love of this subject to all who had the privilege of knowing him. It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional le. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘le and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountul fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautul, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these dferent organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the dference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day  it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identied all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them  they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however,  we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or  Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed  the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105  the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause signicant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and dfered substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"claim dup leader foster asked for loyalty of mlas during onetoone meetings","story":"\n Hi

This is not the first time this has happened and MLAs were not asked the question which you suggest.\"\n\nThe DUP source told the Nolan Show that Mrs Foster is in a \"dark place\" because of the RHI scandal that has engulfed the DUP and that it was \"50/50\" she will continue as leader of the party.\n\nMr Nolan said a number of senior figures within the party had made similar claims. \n\nPolitical commentator Alex Kane said he \"wasn\u0027t surprised\" at the claim. \n\nMrs Foster was Minister for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  when the RHI scheme was launched.\n\nThe botched green energy scheme allowed people to make signicant profits due to subsidies being set at a higher rate than the cost of fuel.\n\nMrs Foster has denied any wrong-doing over the scandal.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"film reveals pope john paul ii effect on northern ireland peace process","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Suddenly I was taken seriously.\n\n“Weeks after his visit, I had been visited by senior Labour MPs and Father Edward Daly.\n\n“I was the first IRA man to publicly turn away from the IRA in 1977, and after the Pope’s visit, scores of other prisoners left.\n\n“To put the Pope’s visit in context, 28 days before the visit, Mountbatten was killed along with 18 soldiers.\n\n“I believe that was the closest Northern Ireland had ever come to civil war.”\n\n\n\nProtestant leaders in the documentary say that speech was the break, where they first separated the Catholic Church from the IRA\nDavid Naglieri\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film focuses on the Pope’s famous appeal in Drogheda: “On my knees I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and  to the ways of peace,” in front of a quarter a million people, and argues this sowed the earliest seeds of peace.\n\nMr Naglieri said the film-makers discovered handwritten letters from Father Alec Reid to John Hume, which directly quoted the papal message.\n\n“Through researching, at first we found a lot of cynicism – people said the violence continued for two decades after the visit, and superficially it didn’t have much effect – but for us it was a lot of peeling the onion,” he said.\n\n“The thesis is not that the Good Friday Agreement wouldn’t have happened  he didn’t come, but we’re tracing the ripple effects of the Pope’s visit.\n\n“For instance, Protestant leaders in the documentary say that speech was the break, where they first separated the Catholic Church from the IRA.\n\n“However, the strongest case for the impact of the visit is the letters from Father Alec Reid.\n\n“On May 19 1986 Father Alec Reid writes a seven-page letter to John Hume and references the speech in Drogheda twice, pointing to the part about dialogue being the way forward, and this ultimately sparks the secret meetings between John Hume and Gerry Adams, which lead to the peace process.\n\n“The words germinated in the minds of peace makers, and without that happening Good Friday doesn’t happen.”\n\nJohn Paul II In Ireland: A Plea For Peace will have a limited theatrical release with Omniplex cinemas in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in late September.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes,  a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"move beyond a sticking plaster approach to northern ireland powersharing mps tell bradley","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

dock the pay of Assembly politicians while the long-running impasse continues were welcomed by the Commons Northern Ireland Committee.\n\nBut it cautioned against using civil servants in the absence of a ing legislature at Stormont, saying they should not “continue to be expected to make determinations that in a ing democracy fall to Ministers”.\n\nLast week Northern Ireland Secretary Mrs Bradley announced a plan to cut Assembly members’ pay and bring forward legislation giving greater clarity around civil servants’ powers to make decisions in the absence of a ing Executive.\n\n\n\nCivil servants should not continue to be expected to make determinations that in a ing democracy fall to Ministers\nCommittee chairman Andrew Murrison\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nPowersharing collapsed early last year in a row over the DUP’s handling of a botched green energy scheme and a dispute over identity issues like the Irish language has seen repeated rounds of negotiations fail.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Friday released Government responses to a report on devolution it published in May, which had urged Mrs Bradley to increase the tempo of ministerial decision making.\n\nCommittee chairman Andrew Murrison said the Government had “started to think about plugging the democratic deficit” by acting on MLA pay and moves to restore the Policing Board.\n\nBut he added: “We are glad that the Secretary of State has acknowledged that more clarity is needed on the powers of civil servants to take decisions in the light of recent legal challenge.\n\n“However, whilst we keenly await further detail on this, we are clear that civil servants should not continue to be expected to make determinations that in a ing democracy fall to Ministers.\n\n“There is no evidence in the Government response to our report, nor in the Secretary of State’s comments last week, to suggest that talks to restore devolution are imminent.\n\n“We must move beyond a sticking plaster approach and do more to facilitate sustainable governance in the region with proper accountability and scrutiny mechanisms.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds in Westminster \n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week Democratic Unionists leader Arlene Foster warned the Government not to “subcontract” its role in restoring power sharing after calls were made for independent mediation in the dispute.\n\nMeanwhile, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill met Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney in Dublin and said it was disgraceful an Executive was not in place.\n\nShe added: “The reason we have not had it is because of the British Government and their toxic relationship with the DUP.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts ballinderry road closed over incident","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

In the interim,  it is similar to previous industrial revolutions, it seems likely there will be a period of technological unemployment, dislocation and rising inequality.\n\n“Given that it could happen more rapidly, the challenge of workforce adjustment could be more dficult.\n\n“The shts required in employment from jobs involving heads to those with hearts and hands could be far greater each year than seen in previous episodes.”\n\nHe noted that rates of pay growth in the UK were below pre-financial crisis averages of a decade ago, largely reflecting continued weakness in productivity growth, and said uncertainty around Brexit has had a dampening effect.\n\nHe reiterated that the Bank of England was well prepared for a range of potential Brexit outcomes.\n\n“The Monetary Policy Committee will respond to any persistent change in the outlook to bring inflation sustainably back to 2% target while doing what it can to support jobs and activity.\n\n“The appropriate policy response is not automatic and will depend on the balance of the effects on demand, supply and the exchange rate.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"how art hidden on the edge of books has found new fans after tweet goes viral","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

🤯 \npic.twitter/nwVKf8Eilm\n\n— Chris  \nSeptember 5, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn the video, the revealed picture shows people by a lake surrounded by a handful of buildings. \n\nHis surprise was echoed by others on the platform as it racked up a huge social score – 26,000 likes, 9,000 retweets and more than half a million views.\n\nIt spawned hundreds of comments on the mastery of the art and a general consensus that people will be out searching for such artwork in libraries. \n\nThe clip came from a short video showing the craft by Cornell University in New York state, which still has only a fraction of that reach, just over 11,000 views. \n\nIt shows artwork credited to Miss CB Currie on the edge of a 1925 copy of Rudyard Kipling’s Kim from Cornell University Library’s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book is unique, says Cornell, because it includes a laid-in photo of the scene depicted on the page edge. \n\nThe video was created by university archivist Evan Earle in 2015. \n\nBut don’t be expecting to see this style of artwork on new novels.\n\nIn 2017, the UK’s Heritage Crafts Association listed fore-edge painting as “critically endangered” on the Radclfe Red List of Endangered Crafts. \n\nOnly three people were known practitioners of the art and there were no trainees trying to master the skills to keep it alive. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"woman who went viral rapping missy elliott performs with the star herself","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The media captured the events of the day relaying it to a mass audience via TV and radio, and subsequently it became known as the day the Troubles began.\n\nThe event is being held as part of the Speeches Strikes and Struggles series which has been running throughout the year, led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and supported by the Esmee Fairbairn Collections Fund. The programme aims to open archive materials up to new audiences and offer a iety of perspectives on what was an immensely signicant era.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said it would provide a unique opportunity to hear first-hand accounts from some of the people who led the civil rights campaign. \n\n“The Duke Street March changed the course of local history by initiating a movement against the civil oppression which had affected the lives of so many people across N. Ireland. People took to the streets to demonstrate that they were not prepared to accept the ongoing violation of their civil rights which had become the accepted way of le here.\n\n“50 years on we live in a very dferent society thanks to the actions of those who were prepared to stand up against oppression.

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is ided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style mot. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date. As the two rings from Bright dfer little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement. If the rings were in circulation for a reasonable  of time it is even possible that they could have been owned and eventually lost by the castle\u0026rsquos occupants.\n\nMeanwhile, a fragment of Viking \u0026lsquohack silver\u0026rsquo, dating back to the ninth or 10th century, has been discovered near Drumbo.\n\nExperts say the piece, which is less than 2cm in , would originally have been part of a larger item such as an arm ring or bracelet.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Scientist elected as international council member  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA CARRYDUFF scientist has been awarded membership of a prestigious international body for food science and technology.\n\nProfessor Margaret Patterson has been elected as one of the seven council members of the International Union of Food Science and Technology .\n\nIUFoST represents more than 150,000 food scientists and technologists in over 60 countries throughout the world.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

there was a \u0026#8220tsunami\u0026#8221 of RHI applications coming, with huge budgetary implications \u0026#8211 but he cannot recall whether he mentioned that to his boss, the then finance minister, Arlene Foster.\n\n                \nDr Crawford said that in his communication with fellow DUP Spad Timothy Cairns he was effectively telling him “there’s a tsunami coming here – you need to move”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe said that in early summer 2015 as he was made aware of major emerging problems with the RHI scheme he could not recall whether he had informed his minister – the then finance minister, Mrs Foster – about the potential problem coming from their former department about a scheme which they had overseen.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen asked how likely it was that he had told Mrs Foster, he said: “I cannot recall. It would be wrong for me to say here whether I done [sic] it or not. I regularly kept the minister up to date with issues, but she was in a new department, we had all sorts of issues with welfare reform and all sorts of challenges coming through the finance department so...”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nWhen pressed on the issue, Dr Crawford added: “It’s something that I should have done. Did I update her verbally on it? I just cannot confirm that, one way or the other.”\n\nBarrister Joseph Aiken said that Mrs Foster has told the inquiry that Dr Crawford did not tell her about the issue.\n\nMr Aiken then read to Dr Crawford an email which he sent to Mr Cairns where he said that over-spending on the scheme “would be to Northern Ireland’s advantage” because it would mean getting more than our fair share of the UK pot. Dr Crawford defended the rationale behind what he had said, saying that there were reasons why Northern Ireland should get more.\n\nAs in the first four days of his evidence, Dr Crawford repeatedly used phrases such as “I can’t recall”, “I’m at a loss to know how that conversation went”, “I don’t know”, “I can’t say” as he conveyed a lack of clarity about many key details, leading to detailed questioning from the inquiry as it attempts to piece together what happened.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n

News Letter can reveal.\n\n                \nThe maximum number of seated places has been slashed from around 900 seats to around 400 between 8am and 9am, our analysis of the old and new vehicle capacities as compared against the old and new timetables shows.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nA reader sent this picture in that she had taken at Connswater to accompany a letter complaining about over-crowding on the route that she had used for 30 years without ever having to stand, but was now standing almost every day.

The new Gliders have a bigger overall capacity, 105, but far less seating, 46\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nThe News Letter has worked this out by comparing the timetable of the old number 4 bus, which operated between Ballybeen/Dundonald and the city and the new Glider timetable.\n\nThe old number 4 route had 12 double deckers travelling at the height of the morning peak, between 8am and 9am \nsee panel, below, for timings from Knock, where all previous number 4 buses stopped, and the city centre\n.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere are now nine to 10 \n\n Gliders that travel the route between Dundonald and Belfast city centre at that time in the morning rush hour.\n\nThe double decker buses had 74 seats and room for 18 people standing — a total capacity of 92 passengers.\n\nThe Glider can hold more people overall, 105, but far fewer people sitting — a total of only 46 seated .\n\nThat means that at the very height of the morning rush hour seat capacity has fallen radically from a potential 888 people seated to a mere 437.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe overall capacity, including people standing, has also fallen notably, albeit more modestly, in that busiest hour, from some 1,104 people overall to 997 people.\n\nThe figures help explain why the peak-time service has been beset by reports of people crammed into the vehicles.\n\nThere would have been a huge increase in standing in the vehicles even  passenger numbers had stayed the same as previously, but Translink claim that the route is attracting new passengers, which makes the overall drop in capacity even more stark.\n\nOur figures assume that that an average of 9.5 Gliders leave Dundonald between 8am and 9am —half of the 19 services that Translink say run 7am-9am . \n\nSo our analysis gave them the more generous of the figures they supplied – ie, we assumed that half of those 19 services run between 8 and 9am.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTranslink said:  “We can confirm that there are 19 Glider departures from Dundonald Park \u0026ampRide to the city centre between 7am and 9am, , then every 6-8 minutes from 9 to 5pm becoming less frequent until the last service from the east at 11.06pm. The current peak timetable schedule would be comparable to the previous  operation.\n\n“We have a fleet of 30 vehicles and around 24 are required to operate at morning peak periods. Early indications suggest the new service has attracted more people on board the Glider, and over the last week we have operated two additional Glider vehicles on the eastern corridor providing additional capacity to ensure all halts are served along the route.”\n\nIt said the Glider has “many of the features of a tram” and caters for more standing “to enable greater capacity while the three sets of double doors, make it easier and faster for people to get off and on compared to a standard bus.”\n\n\n• The News Letter has used the old double decker bus timetable as comparison, leaving from Knock, which is where standing is now the norm into Belfast on the Glider. We have also used Knock as the comparison point because an exact comparison is not possible because not all the previous number 4 buses originated at Dundonald Park and Ride.\n\n\nThe timetable which ended this July had 12 depatures from Knock, Monday to Friday, between 8am and 9am.\n\n\nThey were at:  0801 , 0803 , 0810 , 0818 , 0819 , 0827 , 0833 , 0838 , 0841  0849 , 0857 , 0858 . \n\n\nWhile the Translink used single decker buses on the route off peak, at peak times they iniably used double deckers.\n\n\n• More below but \n\n\nclick here for a letter from a user who is angry at the over-crowding\n\n\nTranslink said in their statement to the News Letter yesterday: “This is a large and complex project for the city the service is still bedding in as people become used to the changes the service brings.\n\n“We also continue to make refinements each day to ensure we have the right capacity, at the right time, and at the right place.”      \n\nThey added:  “We have been very encouraged by the positive feedback overall and we would ask for patience as we work through any teething issues to build on these early results.”\n\nBefore the launch of the service, Translink told this newspaper more about its aims with the new service: “Glider vehicles are designed to carry more people than any of the existing Translink bus fleet. Gliders have capacity for 105 customers — 46 seated and 59 standing and include a designated wheelchair space and access ramp separate space for people with prams and a iety of seating types, including priority seating.”\n\nTranslink also said then: “ The Gliders provide seating for over 40% of their maximum capacity while trams typically only provide seating for around 30% of their maximum capacity. \n\n“Based on average car occupancy commuting into Belfast, one full Glider vehicle could potentially replace 87 cars, helping to reduce congestion and improve air quality along the routes.”\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                                            \n\n    \n\n

and then set out that the capital cost of the boilers would be paid off by the end of year three – with RHI payments to continue for a further 17 years.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn example calculation showed that a boiler owner could expect to get an annual RHI payment of £12,930 per year, with additional fuel savings of £16,437 – meaning RHI income of about a quarter of a million pounds over the 20-year scheme.\n\nMr Aiken put it to Dr Crawford that anyone receiving such a document may be unsure as to whether the claims in it could be accurate and asked him: “How likely is it that [he] – [to] his brother and the special adviser to the minister who brought the scheme that he’s thinking of participating in – didn’t put this document in front of your nose to say ‘Andrew, surely that can’t be right?’”\n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, I’m very clear that he didn’t put it in front of my nose. \n\n“I had no discussion with him about this document, I’d no recollection of ever seeing this document ever before I’ve already said that when I was special adviser I was based in Belfast, I lived in Belfast. Yes, I went home at the weekends and I would have been in regular contact with my family – I’m not distancing myself from that – but I do not have any recollection of seeing this document or having any discussion around it.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPressed by inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin, Dr Crawford said: “I didn’t see the document”, before immediately correcting himself to say: “I’ve no recollection of seeing the document”.\n\nThree months later, Dr Crawford received a ministerial submission about the expansion of the RHI scheme to domestic properties. On the cover of the submission, Dr Crawford wrote the words “what about the non-domestic scheme?”\n\nAt that time he also planted a question to his own minister by getting DUP MLA William Irwin to table a written Assembly question asking  there were any plans to make the RHI less lucrative.\n\nAndrew McCormick, who at that point was the most senior civil servant in Mrs Foster and Dr Crawford’s Stormont department, told the inquiry that when looking back on events it now appeared to him that “well before the problems with the scheme began to emerge , Andrew Crawford appeared to be interested specically in the tarf. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While the origin of the flaw with the tarf still appears to have been a genuine mistake, it is possible that, like many in the private sector, he became aware of the issue relatively quickly.”\n\nHe said that Dr Crawford’s “early interest” in the level of subsidy was evident on a number of occasions, including his planted question to Mrs Foster.\n\nDr Crawford initially told the inquiry that he had asked the question because he wanted to “publicise the fact that there was [sic] not going to be any cost controls introduced to the non-domestic scheme at this stage”.\n\nBut Dr McCormick said: “I have not seen any evidence that suggests that officials were recommending or concerned about costs controls at that stage, so it is not obvious to me why Andrew Crawford felt a need for the point to be publicised”.\n\nDr Crawford also sent an email to huge poultry processor Moy Park in November 2014 saying that the “changes [likely to apply from summer 2015] are not likely to have a negative impact on Moy Park growers”, something Dr McCormick said was striking because he did not believe there was any hint of retrospective changes to the scheme which would have meant Moy Park required such reassurance.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen asked yesterday  there was any reason why people should be suspicious of what he was doing in that period and that he may have known by late 2014 that the scheme was far too generous, Dr Crawford said: “At this stage, I remain [sic] that I wasn’t clear about the tarf rate – the attractiveness, as you describe it, of the tarf. I can’t say more than that.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Why would any reasonable bystander seeing that not be curious – not suspicious that’s the word that’s been used – but curious as to why you were doing that?”\n\nDr Crawford said: “Well, obviously it was raised I’m not sure who by in terms of...”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Don’t worry who raised it. Why would anybody not be curious about why you were doing these two things – you’re organising the question, and you are contacting Moy Park?”\n\nDr Crawford said that people were “piecing together pieces of information from over a period of time... there has been a large number of pieces of literature put in front of me in terms of submissions and all the rest of it what’s happening here is that he’s pulling out two particular comments or an Assembly Question and pulling them together.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “That’s right. They are taking two particular elements. So I’ve asked you why anybody wouldn’t be particularly curious about it. Now I want to ask you why did you arrange the Assembly Question.”\n\nDr Crawford went on to say that he could not now say what prompted the question but that it may have been a newspaper article. He said that the Moy Park message came as the result of a request from the company.\n\nUltimately, Dr Crawford’s brother got a quote from another company – which he accepted, installing two boilers – which showed that between fuel payments and RHI payments he would be getting about £32,000 per year for 30 years.\n\nDr Crawford again said that he was never shown that document.\n\nDr Crawford’s cousin Richard Crawford has six boilers and another cousin John Crawford has three boilers.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n
