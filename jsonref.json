Pictured is Ram Caspi, Netanyahu\u0027s lawyer, arriving at the Justice Ministry\u0027We are sure that once we present our findings there will be no choice but to close the case. He added: \u0027We believe and know that at the end of the day all the three cases must be closed.\u0027   The sessions are expected to extend over four days. And it could take several weeks for the attorney general to render his final decision. However, legal experts say the likelihood of an indictment is very high given the mountains of evidence collected by police over years of investigations and the prosecution\u0027s seeming consensus of pursuing a trial.Although Netanyahu would not be required to step down if charged, he will face heavy pressure to do so.          President Reuven Rivlin (right) selected Netanyahu last week as the candidate with the best chance of forming a governmentHe hasn\u0027t been able to muster the required 61-seat majority in parliament to build a coalition government and faces stiff resistance from those he will need to back him.President Reuven Rivlin selected Netanyahu last week as the candidate with the best chance of forming a government. That move came after Rivlin failed to broker a unity government between Netanyahu and Blue and White leader Benny Gantz in recent days. A unity government appears to be the preferred option for both sides, but they remain far apart on who should lead it first and what such a constellation would look like.          That move came after Rivlin failed to broker a unity government between Netanyahu and Blue and White leader Benny Gantz (pictured) in recent daysNetanyahu and Gantz were set to meet again today before Gantz abruptly cancelled, signaling the likely breakdown of the talks.In such a case, Netanyahu will probably inform the president he cannot form a government. Rivlin will then likely offer a chance to Gantz, who faces equally long odds of doing so. If he too doesn\u0027t succeed, Rivlin can select another legislator or he can set in motion what would be unprecedented third elections.According to the final official results from the September 17 elections, Blue and White finished first with 33 seats in the 120-seat parliament, just ahead of Netanyahu\u0027s Likud with 32 seats. Netanyahu edged Gantz, however, 55-54 in the number of lawmakers who recommend him as prime minister, leaving both short of the magic number of 61. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80c0b370cf556295a967629e1a9507bb656ede1d/377_649_3461_2076/master/3461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a46270d753aa5942f6cfb5dd8870023","title":"vorsprung durch techno the glory days of berlin clubbing in pictures","story":"When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, empty industrial spaces were soon filled with the sounds of banging techno, from illicit parties that went on for days.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

The idea that a naturally arising flaw – “a succinosis, a cavity, a fault” – can allow ancient insects to be caught in a tree’s resin helps him assimilate the fact of death. The glitch that caused his aeroplane to plummet, the sea’s erosion of the coastline, his mother’s tumour: all are part of life’s hidden pattern of growth and decay. Holding the amber up to the light, “igniting the fiery dynamo within”, he marvels that “something so beautiful … could be made out of a fault”.While Rourke doesn’t hold back from the visceral horror of a long illness, there are moments of exquisite understanding between mother and son. When she talks of “the beautiful intrusion” of dust motes in a Hammershøi painting, “messing up the otherwise beautiful composition”, it reinforces his belief that “the best things, the things that speak to us the most, are the mistakes”. He must accept his mother’s flaws and her inevitable passing, in order to love her completely.Occasionally overschematic with its central metaphor, Glitch is nonetheless an unflinching depiction of a son trying to solve the mystery of a parent’s life, as well as coming to terms with his own contradictions. It is a wise and tender novel.• Jude Cook’s second novel Jacob’s Advice will be published by Unbound.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First, BlogWriter shows it’s never too late to read Graham Greene:Just finished Graham Greene’s The Power and the Glory, almost half a century after I first became aware of its existence. A great author, he compels you to step into his characters’ shoes and live their agonies and tribulations from the inside. And then he leaves you thinking.The Perils of Perception by Bobby Duffy is a “must-read”, says rgilyead:The Gene: An Intimate History by Siddhartha Mukherjee has impressed Tempusfugit:His Emperor of All Maladies knocked my socks off and educated me about cancer. This is doing just the same about the gene and genetics. I often look out to the stars and think ‘How has all of this come about?’ This book has me looking within and getting answers to the same question. How these singular building blocks come to work together to create such complexity is fascinating - and elegant and beautiful.Miriam Toews “always brings the goods”, says katcalls and Women Talking is “no different”:Here, the women of a Mennonite community debate whether to leave their home after finding out that a group of men in their community has been tranquilising and raping the women and children of the village. It is based on the true story of a Mennonite community in Brazil. Some sentences here hit me very close to the bone and I had to sit back and take the occasional breather. A gripping read.An utterly bleak vision of contemporary Australia. The Doll, a pole-dancer in Sydney’s King’s Cross, is mistakenly identified as a terrorist after a scare about three bombs in a Sydney Sports Stadium. (In Australia you could blow up the Opera House and get away with it, but blowing up a sports stadium is just unforgivable.) A media pile on, led by a sleazy TV journalist, Richard Cody, convinces the country and the government and opposition that the Doll is a major terrorist, when all she has done is slept overnight with a young Arab, also mistakenly identified as a terrorist … what is truly disturbing about this book, set in the too-real sleaze and corruption of early 21st century Kings Cross, is that with the current overreach of Australia’s terror laws, which Flanagan brilliantly exposes, it could happen to any of us.Finally, NicolaVintageReads brings us an image to consider from Alexandra Fuller’s new memoir Travel Light, Move Fast:‘Hippos often come up to the lawn in front of the pub to graze at night in any case, they’d dispensed with the need for a mower. ‘Careful not to walk up a hippos’s arse in the dark’, Dad always warned if I left my barstool to venture into the pub’s ablution block.’You may have read Fuller’s earlier books, my favourite of which is Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness, where she recalls coming of age in a family of white settlers in Zimbabwe in the early seventies. Sadly, she loses her beloved father in this volume but his presence pervades the pages. Her mother, “Nicola Fuller of Central Africa” is still very much alive and has more than a touch of Nancy Mitford about her. Fuller is unsentimental and often amusing about a tough life and her love of the country she grew up in.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

US manufacturers posted the biggest contraction in September since the end of the 2009 recession, reflecting a slowdown in the US and global economies made worse by the tit-for-tat trade war with China.The news followed surveys across Europe showing manufacturers reducing the number of shifts and and reducing workers’ hours. UK factory output output fell in September for the fifth month in a row to register the longest downturn since 2009, despite a boost from firms stockpiling goods and materials to cope with a no-deal Brexit and the likelihood of border delays.The IHS MarkitCips manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) increased slightly to 48.3 from a six-and-a-half-year low of 47.4 in August to remain below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction.A survey of UK construction on Wednesday only added to the gloom as builders in the commercial sector joined civil engineers and house builders in cutting back on new work.The World Trade Organization said the manufacturing slowdown was more closely aligned with the continuing spat between the US and China over import tariffs that had dragged on for more than 18 months.It warned that the outbreak of tariff wars pose a threat to jobs and living standards as it slashed its forecast for trade growth during 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39b34473fd12bf1ab943a6847a77ad56b818e366/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e30d92de0a8c4c35d5b8ccc5f546639","title":"tesco chief dave lewis ken murphy","story":"Ken Murphy from Walgreens Boots Alliance will take over as retailer’s boss next summerThe Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, has announced his surprise departure after five years at the helm of the UK’s biggest retailer.The former Unilever executive said he had completed the turnaround plan he set in train following the company’s 2014 accounting scandal and would leave the company in a “position of strength”. He will be succeeded next summer by Ken Murphy, a Boots lifer who most recently was the chief commercial officer of its American parent Walgreens Boots Alliance.“My decision to step down as group chief executive is a personal one,” said Lewis. “I believe the tenure of the chief executive should be a finite one and that now is the right time to pass the baton.”The 54-year-old made it clear that he did not have another job to go to and was “not discussing options with anyone”. “I want to take some proper time out with my family and recharge my batteries,” he said. “You pass this way only once.”The Tesco chairman, John Allan, said that it was with regret that he had accepted Lewis’s resignation. “Dave has done an outstanding job in rebuilding Tesco since 2014 and he continues to have unwavering support from the board,” Allan said.Murphy, an Irishman, studied at University College Cork, before going on to qualify as an accountant. Allan described him as a seasoned leader with “deep commercial, marketing and brand experience within retail and wholesale businesses”.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black described Lewis as “the bloke that saved Tesco which should go down as an enormous achievement in British retail history”. He said Lewis’s departure would be a loss to the group leaving Murphy with “big shoes to fill”.Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said Lewis was able to say he was leaving with his “mission accomplished” but questioned why Tesco had chosen an external candidate to succeed him.“What Dave Lewis will do next is unclear but the bigger question is why Tesco overlooked an array of internal candidates and have gone outside and appointed Ken Murphy from Boots (aka ‘Ken who?’) as the new boss,” said Bubb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6aa002cb62c0aaa7d14ef738011001580bfdafa/0_288_5528_3317/master/5528.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef99a3a5eaeda474319b5f4769389dc0","title":"eu imposes hen welfare standards on egg imports for first time","story":"Conditional trade agreement covers eggs from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and UruguayA trade agreement to import produce into the European Union is set to be conditional upon animal welfare requirements for the first time.Eggs imported from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to member states will only be duty-free if the hens are kept in line with EU standards under the provisional terms of the new EU-Mercosur trade agreement.Previous EU free trade deals have included aspirational provisions on animal welfare, such as the 2014 EU-Ukraine association agreement, but this is the first time the elimination of tariffs have been conditional upon particular standards being upheld.Provisionally agreed in June 2019 after some 20 years of negotiating, the EU has signed a trade agreement with the Mercosur nations - Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The agreement will cover a combined population of 780 million, making it one of the largest ever trading bloc arrangements by size.EU\u0027s exports to the Mercosur countries totalled €45bn in 2018. Goods travelling in the other direction amounted to €42.6bn in 2018. The EU is the biggest foreign investor in the region - €381bn in 2017. Trade in services between the two regions was valued at €34bn in 2017.Critics of the deal have said that it has taken too long to sign, and that with the climate emergency, a deal that will facilitate the easier shipping of animal products across hemispheres conflicts with the EU\u0027s stated aim to reduce greenhouse emissions.As a result of the deal, EU companies will save €4bn worth of duties per year. Since 2014, EU trade agreements with 15 countries have entered into force, notably with Canada and Japan.Campaigning organisation Eurogroup for Animals welcomed the condition – which it hailed as “an important turning point in EU trade policy” – but criticised the absence of a similar prerequisite for meat and egg product imports, and called for the approach to be extended.The RSPCA said the announcement that the agreement would be conditional on meeting EU animal welfare standards established “an important precedent” and was a highly significant move.“It is the first time animal welfare standards have been incorporated into tariffs in an EU trade agreement, and something the RSPCA has been advocating for 15 years,” a spokesperson said.“We urge the UK to do the same as it leaves the EU, by rolling over this particular trade agreement and including those welfare standard conditions in any future post-Brexit free trade agreements.”The agreement was quietly made public in a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at the European Parliament last Wednesday, after a leaked document seen by the  suggested the EU had made the demand back in 2016 during the drawn-out negotiations with Mercosur.“There is a cooperation provision in the agreement on animal welfare issues with the very clear objective to improve the level of animal welfare, particularly in the Mercosur countries, to bring them up to our world leading standards,” said John Clarke, director of international affairs at the European Commission’s directorate-general for agriculture and rural development.“For the first time in any trade agreement, we have a condition attached to the export of eggs from Mercosur. They can only be exported at zero-duty if the Mercosur producers meet European standards for laying hens.”Copa-Cogeca, a group that represents European farmers, called for greater work to be done to ensure states with bilateral trading agreements have reciprocal animal welfare standards.“This is central for us, as currently animal welfare is not a universally accepted concept amongst our trading partners,” a spokesperson said. “Some of our trading partners have committed to align their animal welfare standards with the EU, but all too often they have failed to do so.”The British Egg Industry Council said that while the announcement represented “a step forward” it wanted to see the same animal welfare conditions apply to egg products and eggs used as ingredients in food exported to the UK.European Commission sources downplayed the significance of the trade condition and said it would not have a major impact as shelled egg imports from Mercosur countries were limited.Both sides are now preparing the final version of the trade agreement, the largest the EU has ever struck in terms of tariff reduction, before it is submitted to EU member states and the EU parliament for approval.From 2012, farmers across the EU were no longer allowed to keep hens in barren battery cages, within which movement is extremely restricted. However, the cages were often replaced with more spacious versions and a large proportion of the EU’s 500 million hens remain caged for their entire lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/447d1b5b661627f0c5973c496895a7598d57f442/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36a00b315050378f610837722be94f30","title":"alexander skarsgard i spend hours thinking what kind of shoes would this guy wear","story":"The actor talks about 90s style, itchy jumpers and how he pays much more attention to his characters’ outfits than his ownThis is a suit I wore while filming On Becoming a God in Central Florida. The guy I play, Travis Stubbs, works in an office cubicle in the early 90s. He is stuck in a job he hates and not happy about where he is in life, but he has aspirations. He wants to look like a successful businessman but he doesn’t have much style or taste. Bad style in the early 90s gives you a plethora of horrible, horrible outfits. It was one of my favourite characters to create in terms of the look and the hair. It’s always fun when you create a character who looks different from the way they feel. He has bought into a pyramid scheme, so in order to recruit more people he wants to look important and successful. We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo.Going to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: “What kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?” It’s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit – if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot.In my personal life, I don’t pay much attention to what I wear – it’s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don’t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day. That is not to say I’m not interested in clothes – it can be fun to dress up for an event – but that’s a special occasion. I never “put together an outfit” if I’m just running around New York or Stockholm. I have always been allergic to clothes that are not comfortable – as much as I love the look of a wool sweater, I can’t wear them because they’re too itchy. I gravitate towards soft fabrics.Alexander Skarsgård is the face of the new global campaign from Clarks shoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68ba04d5d75962dd2a9b8e8a03e0c328b4df512/0_0_2153_1199/master/2153.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbb5381a24f02ade024b92ff09a94512 480w","title":"tottenham hotspur bayern munich champions league match report","story":"There were 55 minutes on the stadium clock and a look of pure bewilderment on the faces of Tottenham’s defenders. They had just been shredded for the second time in three minutes by Serge Gnabry, Bayern Munich’s former Arsenal winger and, despite having carried the fight to the Bundesliga champions, they were staring at an irretrievable 4-1 deficit.Remarkably, it was only the beginning of the pain for the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, and his team on a night when serious questions could be asked of their character. It has been a difficult season for them so far, with off-field issues from the summer hanging over into the opening weeks. Pochettino has repeatedly given the impression that he has been fighting with one hand tied behind his back. Here, he could do nothing to stop the onslaught as Gnabry and Bayern twisted the knife.This was Gnabry’s night and he finished it with a four-goal haul, as Spurs wilted shamefully in the closing stages. For his hat-trick, he raced away from Jan Vertonghen to collect a long ball from the substitute Thiago Alcântara. He needed only two touches before he swept past Hugo Lloris and, after Robert Lewandowski had added Bayern’s sixth – the striker’s second of the evening – Gnabry beat Lloris yet again.It is incredible to think that Gnabry once spent an unhappy loan spell at West Bromwich Albion under Tony Pulis in the 2015-16 season. He has developed into a world star since leaving the Premier League and he lit up a pulsating night with his pace and precision.Gnabry’s opening goal was arguably the pick of the bunch the first time he sent shockwaves around the stadium with his acceleration, which took him away from Serge Aurier’s slide tackle on halfway. In what felt like the blink of an eye, he had reached the edge of the Spurs area before he cut inside Toby Alderweireld and buried a shot into the far corner.The result reinforced Bayern’s position at the top of Group B and it left Spurs with only one point from their two ties, after the 2-2 draw at Olympiakos a fortnight ago. They have it all to do in order to reach the knockout rounds for a third season in succession but the more immediate challenge is to come to terms with what was a humiliation. The scars will run deep for some time and the fear is that they could derail their season. In their 137-year history, Spurs have never conceded seven at home and never before have an English team been so badly beaten at home in Europe.It felt like a trick of the imagination that Spurs had taken the lead through Son Heung-min that they were the better team for the first 30 minutes and that Pochettino was not guilty of too much exaggeration when he said that he felt in his most upbeat mood of the season at half-time.Spurs played with tempo at the outset and it was no surprise when Son put them in front, having gone close on two occasions in the early running. Both of those chances were laid on by Tanguy Ndombele, with the first being the clearer one. Son should have scored but he would make amends. Dele Alli pressed Corentin Tolisso and it was Moussa Sissoko who provided the incision. Son’s low finish had too much on it for Manuel Neuer.Gnabry had shot too close to Lloris in the second minute – the first sign of his threat – and, although Bayern equalised through Joshua Kimmich’s beauty from distance, Spurs had their chances in the first half. Harry Kane rounded Neuer only for David Alaba to clear while Ndombele was denied by Neuer after Aurier’s clever pull-back.Lewandowski’s goal on the stroke of half-time was the turning point and, if nothing else, it highlighted the slender nature of the margins at this level. Tolisso won the ball as he lay on the ground and Lewandowski took a touch, spun and fizzed a low shot into the corner from the edge of the area. Lewandowski has scored in every game of Bayern’s season – apart from the German Super Cup defeat against Borussia Dortmund, which has been their only loss. He is a byword for efficiency.Niko Kovac, the Bayern manager, was compassionate in victory, saying that his team had simply taken an unusually high percentage of their chances and it should be noted that, after Kane’s penalty to make it 4-2, Sissoko and the substitute Christian Eriksen went close for Spurs. As strange as it sounds, Pochettino’s players believed they could fight back at that point.Yet it was a Pochettino soundbite that hung heavy in the air. It was the one about his players giving up once Gnabry had completed his hat-trick. It was unacceptable. The boos from the home crowd rang out with feeling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049ec5fe1f690e74f0c2a08f4467f8365038b100/0_99_3479_2088/master/3479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4193b65e7bbc2bfacc29e7e16444c21","title":"red bull salzburg anfield liverpool scouting system mane keita champions league","story":"Liverpool’s Mané and Keïta came via the Austrian club whose scouting system is virtually peerless in Africa and beyondWhen Lee Kawanu knew Red Bull Salzburg were keen to sign two of his best young players, he was happy to wait. Plenty of established European giants had made big offers for Patson Daka and Enock Mwepu but the owner of Kafue Celtics, in Zambia’s second tier, knew there was something more suitable in the pipeline. The Austrian champions had been trailing the pair, who were stars for their country at Under-20 level, for some time and Kawanu had heard enough to believe that, if the interest became concrete, this was the move they should hold out for.In the end it materialised. “I just loved the way their setup is, how their scouts work, the way the management treats the players,” Kawanu said of the visit he subsequently made to confirm his impression. “It was fantastic, so I felt it was the perfect place for my boys to develop.”Kawanu is hardly alone in that. While Salzburg’s corporate trappings and position in the wider Red Bull empire may not make them cuddliest proposition for football romantics, many inside the game would say their approach to spotting and nurturing young talent from across the globe sets a standard. The squad that walks out at Anfield on Wednesday night will be one of the youngest, most erse and most meticulously assembled in top-level football. It is likely to include the two Zambians, two Malians, a Cameroonian, a South Korean, a Bosnian, a Norwegian, a Hungarian, a Dane, a Frenchman and a Japanese everyone on that list is aged between 18 and 24, and their presence in the Champions League marks a triumph for a system that is virtually peerless in leaving no stone unturned.Against Liverpool they will come up against two of their highest-profile successes in Sadio Mané and – fitness permitting – Naby Keïta. Those two players were 20 and 19 respectively when they arrived in Austria, having made their professional debuts in France. They are rightly the poster boys for young African players who want to make it in Europe, and serve as shining examples for the role Salzburg perform like few others: polishing young talents and creating stars.But the club’s reach goes much further than Metz or Istres. Much of their present-day work in Africa is conducted with the help of Frédéric Kanouté, the former West Ham and Tottenham player, and his agency, 12 Management. They brokered the deals that took Daka and Mwepu to Salzburg, and also brought the thrillingly gifted Malian forward Sékou Koïta from USC Kita in his home country. The relationship gives Salzburg access to places other clubs have long neglected or simply passed over, opening up pathways from African domestic football to a high level in Europe that had become vanishingly rare.“If you look at Zambia’s example, very few people know our league is one of the better ones in Africa – more organised and higher paid than most of the west African leagues for example,” Kawanu says. “But when someone like Frédéric says, ‘There are two boys here you really should look at’, Salzburg will be straight on the plane to have a close look. I do think they make an effort to look where others might not they are interested in the talent rather than the name of where the players come from.”Daka, a 20-year-old striker, has scored six league goals this season while the 21-year-old midfielder Mwepu, a lifelong Liverpool fan, has played his way into contention for involvement at Anfield. Both players arrived in 2017. Like most of Salzburg’s young arrivals from smaller leagues, they were road-tested at what the club calls “co-operation players” in loan spells at FC Liefering, a second ision club that essentially works as a feeder operation.“There are two key parts from our perspective: the way they scout and the way they handle players,” Kawanu says. “They are quite direct and hands-on in how they deal with the boys, and really honest. I think that’s a unique way of doing things. Most European clubs are strictly about results: you get the player there and they have to perform. Salzburg come to Africa, watch the boys play, meet their parents they make such an effort. We’re talking about the head scout and team manager coming all the way to do that. I think it’s what makes them stand out.”Amadou Haidara, the RB Leipzig midfielder who arrived at Salzburg straight from Mali, is an example of a player who has progressed via this route to one of Europe’s biggest leagues. They have a special handle on the African market but the form of Erling Braut Haaland, the brilliant Norwegian striker who scored a hat-trick on their group stage debut against Genk, and the 18-year-old Hungary midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai demonstrate that their tentacles are well embedded closer to home. The latter spent a brilliant season and a half at Liefering after joining from MTK Budapest he has not looked back since his promotion to the first team last season and will be scouted by most of the continent’s leading lights when he plays Liverpool.Mwepu’s brother Francisco, a physical striker whom Kawanu likens to Romelu Lukaku, has spent time on trial at Salzburg but remains at Kafue Celtics for now. Kawanu hopes others follow and says nearly two decades of work in Zambian football have been made worthwhile by the fact local players can legitimately dream of the steps Daka and Mwepu may take on Wednesday. Red Bull may be a grindingly familiar name but its first football club is approaching the Champions League by taking the unknown more seriously than anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e220001f7f511af4357921302a63e04230e5501/70_26_1090_654/master/1090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad0c9ce9dd3806130c6e6148fda6ac1a","title":"which premier league footballer has the most vowel heavy name","story":"Plus: songs sharing names with teams, when Southend played a league game at Wembley and more“Amanda Palmer released a single called Leeds United, and The Divine Comedy a track called Queen of the South – what’s the highest-charting song to share its name with a football team?” tweets NotThatHunter.Let’s keep this in the spirit of the question and discount songs officially written for clubs – and unless the song title intentionally mentions a club, we’re also going to ignore them. So tracks such as Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé’s ‘“Barcelona” are out. It doesn’t leave us with much but here goes. Chris Warner writes: “‘One for the Bristol City’ by the Wurzels got to No 66 in the UK charts I believe.” It did, Chris. It was first released by Somerset’s leading scrumpy and western band in 1977 to unofficially celebrate the club’s promotion into the top flight but there are no records of whether it charted. It was soon after adopted as the club’s official anthem and the Robins run out to it to this day. A re-release in 2007 made it to No 66.Surely we can go higher than that though can’t we? Well, only if we head to Germany. “In 2000, Die Toten Hosen had a song called ‘Bayern’ which reached No 8 in the national charts,” writes Kristof, who also has a warning for us. “The chorus translates to ‘I would never join Bayern München’. Whether you like Bayern or not , it’s a terrible song, don’t ever listen to it, seriously.” We already have. It’s diabolical but we’re going to embed the official video anyway.We’re getting to the small print now, but it seems that David Southworth’s 96-game English season (last week) can potentially be topped …Here are Dan and James. “Assuming David’s 96 games are correct, there is potential for one additional game in the League One season,” they write. “If the teams finishing second and third are exactly level (on points, goal difference, goals scored, head to head, wins, goals scored in away games, best disciplinary, lowest red cards), then Regulation 9.8 of the EFL rules states:If the above procedures do not separate the clubs, then the clubs concerned shall play off a deciding league match or matches under arrangements determined by the League …Guidance: play-off matches as detailed above only take place in practice when directly involving automatic promotion or relegation places. Those involving home or away advantage in the play-off semi-finals may be resolved by alternate methods which are mutually agreed.“Therefore, if our hypothetical team loses the extra game, they have one extra League One game to play prior to entering the play-offs, making 97 in total.“Two side notes, the guidelines were not clear if a play-off would also be required to separate the bottom-placed team in the play-offs and the team that just missed out. If so, our scenario could equally apply to a League One team finishing sixth or seventh and winning the resulting play-off. There is also a possibility envisaged in Regulation 9.8 of more than one such additional game: ‘League match or matches,’ potentially resulting in a 98th game through a two-legged tie for example.”“A Southend-supporting friend claims the team once played a league game at Wembley? Is he having me on?” asked Stuart Jacks in April 2012.Ludicrously, he wasn’t. Southend were one of two teams – Brentford being the other – to play against Clapton Orient in Division Three (South) at Wembley back in 1930, owing to ground improvement work at Orient’s Lea Bridge Stadium. Their official website took up the story:Following a league match against Torquay (which the O’s won), officials from the Devon club complained about the perimeter fence being too close to the pitch. The Football League was duly asked to inspect the ground and agreed that alterations had to be made before any more games could take place, suddenly the Orient found themselves without a stadium to play in. Incredible as it seems Wembley was suggested and the O’s actually played two league games in 1930 against Brentford and Southend United, winning 3-0 and 3-1 respectively. To this day the Orient is the only Football League side to have played home games at Wembley Stadium!Since then of course, Tottenham Hotspur joined Orient in becoming league residents at Wembley.• For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here.“With regards to Barcelona’s €300 Griezmann-related fine, has there ever been a lighter monetary slap on the wrist for a football club versus club revenue?” asks Tony McGlennon.“I recently stumbled upon this article about Tony Hibbert signing for an unbeaten Sunday league team in 2017 and missing a penalty for them in a 1-0 defeat on his debut.

But where to start? Here are the key trendsModernist architecture is still a big focus for artists – as long as its Eurocentric and male-dominated history can be rewritten while its buildings are celebrated. Frieze Live is one of the fair’s main curated sections, and this year it features British artist Shezad Dawood’s performance piece. Dawood’s work draws on the work of Bangladeshi modernist architect Muzharul Islam, who combined the lessons of western modernism with a Bengali architectural language. It will also feature dancers (wearing costumes by up-and-coming designer Priya Ahluwalia) weaving through a backdrop of fabric hangings, and will be soundtracked by music from electronica act Patten, inspired by Indian poet, musician and Nobel prize winner Rabindranath Tagore, and jazz musician Alice Coltrane.Brutalism is also presented in the wider fair in Seher Shah and Randhir Singh’s collaborative project Studies in Form for Green Art Gallery’s booth, which shows buildings such as the Barbican in London, Akbar Bhawan in New Delhi and Dentsu Head Office in Tokyo, fragmented and reimagined as cyanotypes – one of the first photographic printmaking processes.The debate about museum collections and the ownership of artefacts has been addressed at art fairs before, but Jaanus Samma’s installation at the Temnikova \u0026amp Kasela gallery in Tallinn, Estonia, should be special. Samma is one of the most widely recognised artists from Baltic Europe and has represented his country at the Venice Biennale. His multimedia work shifts shape and style, often looking at national identity and Estonian history through the prism of queer theory. For Frieze, his installation Museum Display features curtains from a Soviet community centre, castrated classical sculptures and a rug made from traditional Estonian mittens.Rozsa Farkas, director of London gallery Arcadia Missa, says her booth will feature “young artists who think about the politics of representation and engage with figuration and symbolism as a means to open up a certain visual language to conversations on identity”. At Frieze, this means Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings’ collaborative work. Most recently featured in the Kiss My Genders show at the Hayward Gallery in London, this has explored queer social spaces and communities as places of resistance.It’s always interesting to see how blue-chip galleries approach new trends. Previous Hauser \u0026amp Wirth booths have been imaginatively curated (including by Mary Beard in 2017) but this year’s will be more conventional, and representative of current trends. Black American photographer Lorna Simpson and Japanese Gutai group artist Takesada Matsutani are joined by conceptual artist Jenny Holzer and recently “discovered” Phyllida Barlow. Senior director Neil Wenman says: “It’s the best of the best! Museum quality.” That’s one way to describe what was once overlooked by mainstream galleries. Let’s hope it leads to real change in the art industry, and not just nice things to look at at Frieze.British-Australian artist Nicholas Pope was a rising star in the 70s art world, representing Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1982. The same year, on a research trip to Africa, he contracted a rare form of encephalitis that resulted in permanent brain damage and a long career break. Now he has been rediscovered and the Sunday Painter gallery in London is showing his sculptural 1995 ceramic installation Yahweh and the Seraphim at Frieze. It veers between the religious and the profane, and his new work references religion in a woozy, sexy, at times grotesque way. This year’s main curated section is the exhibition Woven, put together by Cosmin Costinas, executive director of the not-for-profit Para Site art space in Hong Kong. The show looks at the legacy of colonialism through the textiles and weaving of artists and galleries mainly from south and south-east Asia. “The history of weaving is both rich and loaded,” Costinas says. “It was marginalised for a long time, in part because it was associated with women and outside a Eurocentric view of art.” Costinas’s selection is multigenerational and includes Indian artist Monika Correa, whose textile works  almost 60 years, and 30-year-old Filipino artist Cian Dayrit, whose weaving looks at the impact of colonialism, ethnography and mythology. Indian-American artist Chitra Ganesh’s presentation for Gallery Wendi Norris promises to be a visual overload of textiles, glitter, mirrored glass and faux fur. It takes Hieronymous Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights as a starting point and features superheroines, comic-book and Bollywood imagery, surrealism and queer theory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba424dd3346833b8524a4c7ac732de818de0eef4/0_246_4400_2639/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4437c2d08b7bd823bf653e717f09b87","title":"thomas cook visa refused boarding refund","story":"They lost their holiday and £2,400 after being wrongly refused boardingI booked flights to Mallorca for a family holiday in June through Thomas Cook. We have Iranian nationality and hold a UK residence permit and a UK refugee travel document. The Spanish embassy advised that I did not require a visa.We arrived at Manchester airport at 3.30am to be greeted by a Thomas Cook representative who refused to allow us to board our flight, telling us we were not born in the UK and therefore needed a Schengen area visa.Obviously, I know I was not born in the UK and I certainly did not need her to announce it so forcefully in front of a crowd of customers. This holiday was inexpressibly important to us after a stressful year, but we had no option but to return home. I’ve since checked with the Spanish embassy and have proof that our travel documents issued under the 1951 UN refugee convention entitle us to enter Spain without a visa.MB, ManchesterYou contacted me before the news of Thomas Cook’s crippling debts broke. Over the ensuing nine days I battled to extract redress from the company for your abysmal treatment. It blamed a “system error” and offered to refund your flights and associated costs, including accommodation you’d booked through another provider. It added a derisory £300 as goodwill between the three of you. Only after further badgering did it concede that you were owed compensation of €400 each for denied boarding under EU regulations. Then all went quiet. A week ago, it promised to look into why the money hadn’t reached you. Five days later it went into administration along with £2,400 it owed you.Since you paid by debit card you are not protected by the Consumer Credit Act, which holds credit-card issuers jointly liable for a breach of contract. Visa operates a similar chargeback scheme for debit-card users, but it’s a voluntary protection rather than a legal obligation and you have to claim within 120 days of the purchase.Your shocking experience is not uncommon. Following the 1985 Schengen agreement for a borderless Europe, airlines were effectively appointed as immigration controllers. They face fines of up to €5,000 if they are found to have carried inadequately documented passengers and pay to return them to the country they flew from.The inevitable result is that the airlines err on the side of caution and, if they are presented with documents they are not familiar with, it is cheaper to turn passengers away.This, of course, means that refugees and asylum seekers who don’t hold full EU passports are disproportionately affected. Judging from the cases that have come my way, they lose not only their holiday but their money, since airlines do not readily refund the fare unless a headline looms. It’s sickening that, due to Thomas Cook’s incompetence and prevarication, you’ve lost out once again.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

In the five months since my daughter Riri was born, we have barely been apart. Motherhood, for me, has been a meditation – a scrunchie-wearing, vomit-stained, oxytocin-induced trance. When Shaun, who is playing guitar at the London show, came over yesterday to rehearse, I could barely speak. Riri and I are codependent. I only know the language of nappy rash and baby-led weaning.My only consolation this morning was putting her in a new onesie. It has the cast of Frasier dressed up as Kiss on it, and it says “I’m Listening Tour”. I take photos of her as we wait for Caz, our tour manager, to arrive. Then I realise that Caz will arrive at some point. I rush upstairs to throw muslins into a suitcase. My guitars have been packed for days, gathering dust in the hall. At this point, I’d rather forget a guitar than a breast pump.As the van pulls up, I nervously eye the unbelievable pile of baby equipment on the doorstep. I had forgotten the key part of touring was loading and unloading. My Auntie Lesley, who has volunteered for childcare, is our only crew. She is a retired flight attendant and not a roadie. Riri is a baby, and not a roadie. I hand her to Auntie, and start lifting cases. Thanks to the muscle memory of past tours, this gives me a thrill.Twenty minutes into the drive, Riri takes her biggest ever shit. The Frasier sleepsuit is removed in a petrol station forecourt on the M25. We drive for six hours, stopping often for feeds. We are incredibly late for soundcheck. Then we are late getting to the hotel for the bedtime routine. Then I am late getting on stage, because I was laundering pooey clothes in the bathtub. “Hello everybody!” I say, forgetting the lyrics to every song.But my fans are my friends. They know I’ve just had a baby. They take their phones out and Google the lyrics. They laugh as my fingers land on all the wrong strings for the final riff of Dylan, and give thumbs ups when I start War again on the piano. At the end of the set, they line up to tell me, at the merch desk, that it gets easier. They tweet kind words of support, which I scroll through on the way to the hotel, my baby’s poo still under my nails. Then I run towards our room and lie beside her absolutely enormous and cumbersome sleep pod, holding her hand and murmuring that I will never leave her again.Our travelling party sounds like a mashup of 90s films – Four Women and a Baby. As well as Auntie, Caz, Riri and I, there is Bishi, the special guest at the shows. After breakfast, she meets us at the hotel lobby and shyly asks for a cuddle from Riri.“Did you sleep?” she asks, following up from the conversation we had yesterday when we met. Bishi, a genuinely friendly person, tried to get to know us. Even though her album, Albion Voice, is one of my favourites, I could only babble: “Riri is going through a sleep regression. She wakes up every hour.”The regression came on a week before tour. I fear it will get worse now that Riri is separated from her dad, who couldn’t get the time off work. Before we left for tour, I told him: “I’m sure it will be fine to combine touring and baby care, the two most exhausting things I’ve ever experienced.” On the road towards Newcastle, I hold Riri’s hand as she sleeps in the car seat, and nap for two glorious, unbroken hours. It’s the most rested I’ve felt in months.Soundcheck is also the longest I’ve been away from Riri. With a bit of headspace, I am able to talk to Bishi properly. She lets me handle her Ableton Push, and we debate the best EQ for her sitar. I feel almost normal. When the gig begins, I remember how to perform.At the end of the gig, my boobs fill up with milk. I check the time. Later, at the hotel, Auntie tells me that Riri cried at around 10:45. “I know,” I say.Tomorrow is our day off. Tour manager Caz’s parents have kindly invited us to stay at their house tonight, and Riri has a firm playdate with Caz’s two kids tomorrow. All this is taking place in Bedford, so tonight Riri and Auntie will hang in the dressing room during the gig. There will be no bedtime routine in a hotel.Just before soundcheck, I realise I didn’t load the nappies. I pop out to the van to get them. There are no windows in the boot of the van, and I fumble to reach the bag in the far corner. I hear a slam. In total darkness, I cannot feel a handle on the inside of the door.Because I am trying to use my phone less around the baby, I did not bring it, so I can’t call anyone or use the flashlight. Cold sweat gathers on my palms as I start pounding on the side of the van, yelling for someone to come. I can’t tell if the panic is because of the enclosed space, or because Auntie might get Riri hooked on formula while I wait to be rescued. After five minutes, an extremely nervous man opens the boot from the outside. He looks unsure of whether he’s just busted a human trafficking ring. I wave the diaper bag. “Forgot nappies! Hahaha!”After the gig, there is a club night. I beg the DJ not to turn the volume up until I’ve got the baby out of the building. She turns it down for half a second, then quite clearly makes it 12 times louder. (If you’re reading this, Dr Ho, Riri is safely in the dressing room with ears covered. Please don’t quit being our paediatrician.)I think about the concept of the “good-enough mother”. Sure, a perfect mother wouldn’t unload her infant through a club night on Friday in Birmingham, but maybe a good-enough mother would? Pondering this, I run down the fire exit, into the street.There is a new mum in the venue who has left her six-week-old at home. “I’ve just spilled all my breast milk in the Portaloo,” she says. “I thought you would understand my pain.” She is right. I can literally think of nothing more depressing than wasting a pumped feed. “You really can cry over spilled milk,” she says, as we hug.Manchester is a home-on-tour for me. I have a friend here, Bernie, who I have been staying with since my very first days of making music. Back then, her youngest child was eight. Now he’s an adult, and I am about to introduce her to my baby.I am almost shy as we park in the familiar drive, self-conscious about the changes that motherhood has wrought in me. But it is heaven to be back with Bernie. Tonight will be emotional. We have invited Nicky from the Earlies, who co-produced my first album, to the show. Bernie is coming too, with her daughter Alice.At the venue, Caz and I load our gear up the outdoor staircase, through pouring rain. After soundcheck, we drive back to Bernie’s to feed. Although it’s really, really annoying to carry a stage piano up slippery iron steps, I am amazed by us – two mothers with three children between us, rolling around Greater Manchester in our transit van. We have already admitted to each other that touring, even with a baby, is easier than being on primary carer duty.The gig is everything I hoped it would be. Just before Caz and I carry the equipment back down the stairs, I catch Nicky. When we made the album, 10 years ago, we finished every session at the pub. Tonight, we take our phones out and compare daughters. Then he goes home to get an early night. “School tomorrow,” he says.Until today, the gigs have meant less than three hours separation from Riri. Now I am going away for the entire day. As the taxi comes to pick me up for the Union Chapel, I feel as though I’m being dragged away for an execution (I’ve been listening to an Anne Boleyn audiobook).Caz has brought her three-year-old to soundcheck. He strides around the stage, clearly comfortable in a venue, handing his mum masking tape when she needs it.Tom, the pianist who produced First Love with me, arrives for soundcheck. His son is a year old, and we talk endlessly about sleep routines. Ed, our old friend and frontman for Stats, joins in. His son is 14 months. I am talking just to join in. I know nothing can help me.Since the night she went to a rave in Birmingham, Riri has fundamentally forgotten how to sleep. I feel like I am hallucinating from sleep deprivation. Thank God for my memories of Glastonbury 2009, or I wouldn’t believe that I could perform while feeling this tired.I’ve invited a lot of friends to the gig, and as the crowd begins to fill, I wander the aisles of the venue, looking for them. This is how I bump into Alex, who once booked me to play a gig in his garden. He is here with his partner and a tiny, tiny baby. I am immensely impressed. I should have brought my baby, I think. But I already suggested to Auntie that I strap Riri to my back for the shows, and was kicked out of the aparthotel.Without the baby, I am finally able to watch the other acts. Stats and Bishi are both extraordinary. I can’t believe I’m out so late! And at a gig!As my show begins, a voice in my head tells me I should be thinking about my child. Try to disassociate from the performance and think only about your baby, it suggests, seducing me. But Union Chapel is my favourite venue, and it’s sold out. This feels too good to give up. I give myself permission to focus.For the penultimate song of the evening, I bring on all the people in the crowd who mean the most to me – family and musical collaborators. For the briefest of moments, I forget that I am a parent. I forget that I am tired. I forget that I am at work. I forget that I need to get back early for the night wakings. I am a performer, I am surrounded by love.One last song, dedicated to Riri and her dad, then the spell is broken. I thank the audience, meaning it more than ever before – they got me out of the house. Then, because Caz, Tom, Ed, the promoter, my agent, and most of the venue staff have kids at home, we all get the hell out of there.• Emmy the Great is an ambassador for Parents and Carers in Performing Arts, an organisation that raises awareness of the challenges facing carers and parents working in the performing arts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f6bd3340dff3c4350e0cfd48c90cd8f76b5638f/0_130_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3edaf42592fbdc3d145b92554c825042","title":"jessye norman life in pictures","story":"Singing with Jon Bon Jovi, performing La Marseillaise in Paris, receiving a medal from Obama … we remember the many sides of the great American opera singer, who has died aged 74"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

Too quiet. After more than two and a half days in a drug-induced coma, the Conservative party conference was slowly dying on its feet. One minister after another making a second-rate speech to a disengaged audience. Everyone in a state of denial that things could fall apart at any time.Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the 66-year-old treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, had merely been biding his time. You can just imagine how he did it: locked and loaded and buzzing with amphetamines, bursting into the international lounge with another guest.“Er, does your friend have a pass,” the security guard inquired.“Don’t you know who I am?” Geoff snapped. “You’ll never take me alive.”“Show me your pass.”“There will never be a border post here. I will not surrender.”In the life and death struggle that ensued, Psycho Geoff was finally overpowered and subdued. Police and paramedics were summoned, while a huge crowd of journalists looked on. It had been by far the most interesting thing that had happened throughout the entire conference. Thirty minutes later, Geoff was sent home. On the proviso he didn’t tell any other MPs, otherwise they’d all be getting tooled up. Anything to get away.Less than an hour after one of the party’s senior MPs had been brought to heel by a gang of coppers and kicked out, the afternoon session on law and order began in the main hall. Sometimes the political sketch can only be a transcription service. Last year’s conference break-out star, Geoffrey Cox, had been billed to speak but the attorney general has since been exiled for giving the government duff legal advice and the audience had to make do with the more mediocre talent of junior minister Kit Malthouse.“The 20,000 increase in police numbers will be the biggest expansion since …” the hapless Malthouse’s voice tailed away. Since the Tories had cut police numbers by 20,000 nine years ago. Priti Patel emerged to make her first conference speech as home secretary as if she was hosting a TV awards ceremony. All sparkly eyes and Colgate smiles. Ting! It was just a shame that she fought a losing battle with the autocue. Her dimness is a thing of wonder. Sentences died away, to be followed by long pauses. There were no gags because Priti doesn’t do gags. Not effective enough. She much prefers nooses.“Today, here in Manchester, the Conservative party takes its rightful place as the Party of Law and Order in Britain once again,” she began. Er … run that past us again, Priti. Psycho Geoff on his way home to the Cotswolds in the back of a police car under armed guard. The prime minister has been accused of groping two women at the same time and channelling public funds to a woman with whom he had an affair. The government judged by the supreme court to have acted unlawfully over prorogation. The full-on search to find a way of getting round the Benn Act. Mark Francois committing crimes against his own sanity. Right now, it was harder to find someone in the Tory party without serious form.And … smile. Patel carried on. She was going to clamp down on foreigners. Because the very idea of a home secretary with immigrant parents was totally unthinkable. And she’d be chucking out Sajid Javid. Not because he had Asian parents, but because he was a bit rubbish. “When it comes to the intelligence services … what can I say?” she continued. As it happened, nothing. Intelligence and Priti aren’t often found in the same sentence.The biggest irony lay in the subtext. The bottom line was there seemed to be no law that Patel would not break to get the UK out of the EU. Boris and the constitution could have a free pass. Brexit trumped everything. Whatever it took. Even starving out the Irish. The speech wasn’t about the rule of law: it was pure populism. She just about refrained from bringing back hanging but she left it open as a possibility. That could wait till next year. Come to think of it, maybe it was time to build some amphitheatres and feed remainers to the lions.There was no place for the north London metropolitan liberal elite, Priti insisted. Her smile still intact. That didn’t sound like good news for Boris or Dominic Cummings. Not that she cared. She ended her speech with a prayer to Margaret Thatcher. Where there is love, let me sow hatred. This drew the loudest applause of the entire conference. For all her faults, Thatcher would be turning in her grave.As she left the stage, the PA system played “She’s so Priti, oh so Priti … she’s va-cant.” Psycho Geoff meanwhile contemplated his first night in solitary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/940ffb658c23307d5fad17f607d2fc7c0c4f8918/21_407_5722_3433/master/5722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=402a1c8de9348f2929575357a2a475ae","title":"ready text go typing speeds mobiles rival keyboard users","story":"Global test finds those using two-thumb technique can hit a blistering 38 words per minuteThink of it as an upside to spending hours on a smartphone. Thanks to all that dextrous thumb work, people can now type nearly as fast on a screen as they can on a keyboard.Researchers made the discovery during a study of typing skills in which more than 37,000 volunteers from 160 countries took a speed and accuracy test on their mobile phones.One volunteer thumbed out sentences on their mobile phone at a blur-inducing 85wpm, far exceeding the 52wpm that people typically reach on a standard keyboard. While the study involved participants from around the world, the majority were women in their 20s and about half were Americans.“One of the most surprising things we found is that some people can type surprisingly fast with smartphone keyboards,” said Anna Feit, a co-author of the study and computer scientist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. “We showed, at a large scale, that people who type using both thumbs are very much faster than those who use just one finger.”People who could remember when mobile phones were only good for phone calls were considerably slower than younger users, the study suggested. Teenagers tapped out sentences at an average of about 40wpm, while those in their 40s and 50s managed only 29wpm and 26wpm .“We see a clear trend due to experience in typing on these devices,” Feit said. “Young people are growing up with them and some do all of their typing on mobile phones.” On average, those who took part in the study spent six hours per day on their devices.Spending more time on smartphones only partly explains why people are getting faster at screen typing. Mobile devices are often improved with technical tricks that help people type more quickly, such as autocorrect and word prediction.The scientists found that autocorrect improved typing speeds by nearly 9wpm, but word prediction slowed people by 2wpm, distracting them and making them choose suggested words.“If you want to be fast, make use of both your thumbs and turn on autocorrection, even though it might be annoying at times,” said Feit. “And then just keep using it.”The researchers from Aalto University in Finland and Cambridge University, will present their work at the International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services – itself something of a typing test – in Taipei, Taiwan, on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ba82aaa48df5a06218fc48dbae5096dc05f6de3/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9911b80a07f207e6d9eebee7493bba9e","title":"alcohol sales rise near scottish border after minimum pricing","story":"Study shows MUP led to overall fall in alcohol consumption and a surge in sales near CarlisleSupermarkets close to Carlisle and Berwick reported a surge in alcohol sales after minimum unit pricing was introduced in Scotland.Minimum unit pricing (MUP) came into force in Scotland on 1 May 2018, in an attempt to cut Scotland’s higher-than average alcohol consumption and high death rates from alcohol-related diseases.It bars retailers from selling alcoholic drinks, including beers, wines, spirits and ciders, at less than 50p per unit of alcohol. The Welsh government is also introducing minimum pricing and its cross-border effects will be closely studied by ministers in Cardiff.The NHS analysis of the impact of MUP on retailers found this meant sales of cut-price drinks such as ciders or own brand vodka fell in Scotland, while overall consumption of alcohol fell slightly.A study in the British Medical Journal last week found that MUP led to alcohol consumption falling by 1.2 units per person per week, equivalent to a measure of spirits or half a pint of beer. The impacts were greatest on the heaviest drinkers, whose consumption fell by 2 units.The study, carried out for NHS Scotland by Foresight Economics over the first eight months of minimum pricing, found MUP had some impact on sales and profits, but that was cushioned heavily by a growth in sales of premium drinks with higher margins.Some shops saw their profits go up, but none cut prices of other products to compensate customers.The study found there was no evidence of so-called “white van runs” where vans were stocked up in English supermarkets with cheaper drinks for sale in Scotland, despite the fears of some retailers’ bodies before MUP came into force.However, there was evidence that Scottish residents who work in or visited English towns close to the border appeared to buy far more alcohol in some stores than before.That was not uniform: three of the five unnamed supermarkets near the border who were interviewed reported no change in their sales, and there was no evidence of a substantial fall in sales for Scottish shops near the border.Two reported a “substantial increase” in sales, which tailed off slightly later last year but were “still well above normal”. Morrisons owns the supermarket closest to the border north of Berwick and Asda the supermarket nearest Scotland north of Carlisle.The study said that could have been due to the hot weather last summer and the football World Cup in Russia, but it found comparable stores in other parts of England did not see such rises.Andrew Leicester, from Frontier Economics, said a far more robust picture about the effects of MUP on businesses would take some time.“The short-term impacts of MUP on the Scottish alcoholic drinks industry seen in this study are difficult to differentiate from other factors affecting the market – such as one-off events like the World Cup and periods of good weather,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868c2288b70dcc5ff13e68331bbc6b87d5bdab38/0_232_4730_2839/master/4730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c197390e46580111355461e346b922","title":"france usa rugby world cup match report","story":"• Tries from Huget, Raka, Fickou and Serin and Poirot see off USA• MacGinty lands three penalties but Eagles run out of steamNow this was fun. France beat the USA 33-9, and scored five tries doing it, four of them utterly glorious. The last three came in the final 15 minutes, after this stubborn, spirited US team had pulled themselves back to within three of France’s lead. The French lived up to all your favourite old stereotypes. They were wretchedly flawed, recklessly indisciplined, and utterly fantastic whenever they could hold on to the ball. Much more of this and they might beat anyone in this World Cup, but then much more of this and they might just blow up.In the first half the USA had the better of them in all sorts of ways. They had more of the territory, and more of the possession, and their well-drilled, powerful pack had a clear advantage at the lineout and scrum, where they won six out of eight including one against the head. Their problem was that in between all that, the French kept doing that thing they do. Or that thing they always used to. They took the lead with a try right out of rose-tinted memory.One minute, the USA’s Martin Iosefo was haring up the left wing chasing his own kick, the next, everything had flipped, and the French were flooding back at them. Their tighthead, Emerick Setiano, far too fast and fleet to be a prop, trampled through one tackle, their lock, Bernard Le Roux, broke another, and then, in the next phase, Camille Lopez eased a dainty little chip over the US defence for Yoann Huget to collect mid-stride as he sprinted to the tryline.Lopez made their second, too, with another assist off his boot. It was a high cross-field kick this time, back against the grain of play, all the way to Alivereti Raka on the far wing. While their fly-half is in this form, the French will reckon their chances against any defence in the tournament. Where they struggled though, was with their discipline. They conceded eight penalties in the first half alone, some of them so cynical that they were lucky they only cost them six points, and not a spell or two in the sin-bin too. They tightened up in the second half, and improved their set-pieces too.Still, the score was stuck like that, 12-6, right through the next 25 minutes. The French blew one good opportunity in that time when Sofiane Guitoune ended a dazzling run by hurling a wild forward pass to Raka out on the wing. Then AJ MacGinty kicked his third penalty to make it 12-9. That seemed to spur the French into life. They rolled down field after the restart, through 15 phases, before Gaël Fickou burrowed over from close range. Baptiste Serin picked up their fourth soon after, finishing off a merry spree of broken-field after another brilliant kick by Lopez to secure the bonus point and there was still time for a fifth from Jefferson Poirot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d31a4a66362aee5ef8a726c58c124e36f3b062d/0_102_1276_766/master/1276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0c2e563d9d959992d163ac221b8e46","title":"worlds largest betting firm created with 10bn tsg takeover flutter","story":"Flutter Entertainment, owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, to buy The Stars Group in £10bn dealFlutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, is to buy The Stars Group (TSG), which owns Sky Bet, in a £10bn deal which will create the world’s largest online betting company by revenue.Flutter bought FanDuel last year as it sought to establish a US bulkhead in the wake of the supreme court’s decision to legalise sports betting, a ruling that triggered a race between UK bookmakers to enter the lucrative new market.Peter Jackson, the chief executive of Flutter, will lead a combined business serving 4 million gamblers in 100 markets.He said the takeover would “turbocharge” the company’s strategy of expansion into new markets while retaining a leading position where it is already well established, in the UK, Ireland and Australia.“We believe the combination of Flutter and TSG will deliver substantial value for shareholders,” he said.“We will have an exceptional portfolio of leading recreational brands and best-in-class products on industry-leading technology platforms.”Flutter’s chairman, Gary McGann, said the combined group would also be a “strong voice in the promotion of responsible gambling worldwide”.In its previous incarnation as Paddy Power Betfair, Flutter agreed a £2.2m penalty for responsible gambling failures last year, a settlement that relates in part to an ongoing legal battle with the victim of an alleged theft by a problem gambler.It was one of the few UK high street bookmakers to support the government’s reduction in stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.It was later accused of trying to bypass the restriction after a  investigation found it had developed a new game that mimicked the roulette-style machines while technically abiding by FOBT curbs.It was eventually forced to withdraw the game by the UK regulator, the Gambling Commission.Analysts said the takeover of TSG would soup up Flutter’s efforts to conquer the US and could signal fresh consolidation in a sector that has already witnessed a succession of sizeable mergers.“This will enable Flutter to capitalise upon the relaxation of American laws on sports betting, which is now legal in 11 states, with seven more primed to announced a launch date,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell.“It will also enable the company to ersify further beyond the British and Australian markets, where it is the leader in online punting. Both arenas are relatively mature, tightly regulated and extremely competitive, even after a several rounds of consolidation in the industry.“The latest deal in the bookmaking and gambling business may also prompt speculation as to which firms will be next to acquire – and which firms will be their targets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868c2288b70dcc5ff13e68331bbc6b87d5bdab38/0_138_4730_2839/master/4730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2b65c0b6bc5f73653cb63c866be565c","title":"rugby world cup 2019 france v usa live","story":"France were just three points ahead with 20 minutes to go after an inconsistent, ill-disciplined display but found another gear to seal a bonus-point winTime to sign off now, so I’ll leave you with Andy Bull’s match report from Fukuoka.There’s another match coming up, and it’s a decent bet for the pool stage’s biggest blowout.

Throw in blustery, wet weather and you’ve got yourself some testing conditions.For the USA, Will Hooley is absent after taking two big hits against England, and being stretchered off. In his guest column, Hooley is remarkably sanguine about the whole business, and looks forward to returning later in the tournament:France suffered an embarrassing moment in the buildup to this game, after calling Uini Antonio into the squad. Soon after announcing the La Rochelle prop’s inclusion, they had to backtrack after discovering he had been injured in a match on Saturday, and was out for three months. Zut alors!It’s been 11 days since France played their opening fixture of this World Cup – a narrow, thrilling and somewhat fortunate win over Argentina that was largely forgotten as the tournament hit warp speed.Since then, Jacques Brunel’s boys have kept their heads down at training camp and let the drama unfold elsewhere. France are seventh in the world rankings three of the six teams above them have already lost once. They’ll be happy to keep flying under the radar, as they’ve done to great effect before.First, though, a date with the USA, who were outmatched by England but will happily offer their opponents a bruising workout. On paper, it’s a chance for Brunel to check his squad depth with tougher assignments to come.

Why? Because it’s ‘a place of terror’To fellow comic Bo Burnham, she is the “most influentialimitated comedian of a generation … a millennial Lenny Bruce”. As anyone who saw her Edinburgh fringe debut last year will know, Kate Berlant is the real deal – a sillyclever impro-comic majoring in how identity and ego are performed in the too-much-information age. And yet here she is arriving in London for a short standup run, to zero name recognition and minimal fanfare.That may change: after roles in Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 2018 hit Sorry to Bother You, she now has a TV sketch show in development with sidekick John Early. Telly connoisseurs will identify Early as a star of hipster comedy-thriller Search Party, in which Berlant also appeared. The duo have posted a series of hilarious videos online skewering – as Search Party did – the smart, shallow and self-absorbed millennial way of being. But their TV projects have yet to escape in-development gridlock, obliging Berlant’s genius to remain, for a little while longer, a secret shared by comedy lovers alone.But that’s fine by her, she tells me, on the phone from LA. (She’s a Santa Monica native.) “When I do a show and people turn up, that means more to me than anything,” says the 32-year-old. “Live performance is my favourite thing.” Pause. “That being said, please hire me for film or TV if there’s anyone reading this.”In the past, she’s been bullish in response to TV commissioners’ complaint that her and Early’s slippery brand of humour is too weird. “So we’re supposed to try to make something that appeals to everyone, and by doing so make something that appeals to no one? We firmly reject all of that.” Today, she doesn’t accept the premise. “I don’t think what I’m doing is niche. I can’t stop making faces or crossing my eyes. I’m embarrassingly lowbrow at times.” Earlier in her career, her ambition was to be the new Jim Carrey.The truth is that her comedy scrambles lowbrow and highbrow, as it does the distinction between the “real” Berlant and the character she may or may not be playing. On stage, she presents as a precious, preening comedian-cum-savant, hypersensitive to the atmosphere in the room and to every teensy indication of her own fabulousness. She barely seems to have any actual material, save for her stream-of-consciousness commentary on the gig and her experience of it. The vibe is: it’s our privilege to be in her presence – the more so when the show devolves into (of all things) a demonstration of her psychic powers.The clairvoyancy act, Berlant reports, is sometimes effective to a “spooky” degree: “I think there’s a connection between being psychic and improvising. They’re both about following intuition and not trying to overthink things.” But finally, it’s just a joke – and an excuse, she says, to be more herself onstage. Most comics, I venture, don’t need that much artifice just to reveal their own voice. But Berlant distrusts authenticity in comedy: “Performance is always not you, I would argue.” She will accept though that her stage persona is “an extrapolation of the most annoying parts of myself”, including “my boredom with the idea of the self-deprecating comedian. I’m more like: I very much want attention, that’s why I’m doing this. I just exaggerate how desperately I want to be seen.”Alongside that, she says, “I wanted to confuse my legibility onstage. Is it a character, or a real person? Why is the language I use falling apart?” Why indeed? Because it reflects “the post-internet language that derives from half-reading a million articles, from hearing opinions regurgitated in a couple of sentences. That fragmented access to information that we all have.” Berlant on stage is a “person cobbled together from internet fragments”. Wellness culture, corporate feminism, academic jargon: it’s all in there. “I’m playing a person so steeped in the cultural critiques that I’m obliterated. There’s so much commentary on myself that I cease to really exist.”You could blame her time at NYU, where she did a masters in the cultural anthropology of comedy, and acquired a fascination with “the performance of knowledge.” Or you could blame the fact that her dad is the artist Tony Berlant, renowned for his collages of found metal objects – which might just have inspired the provoking juxtapositions in his daughter’s comedy.But you’d have to admit that, just as it can be read through an art-intellectual lens, so Berlant’s comedy can simply be enjoyed for its ridiculousness and flamboyant liveness. “She’s so totally in the moment,” says her mentor Sarah Silverman. Berlant says: “I have tremendous respect for comics who have their 60-minute act scripted in advance. But for me, it feels dead if I don’t keep it open, and keep myself in a place of terror.”“Maybe that’s not wise for my mental state. But in performance, I just find it impossible to not acknowledge what’s actually going on in the moment.” At the core of her comedy – so self-aware, so aware of the contexts – is a hyper-awareness of “the essential weirdness of performance”, says Berlant, “the brutality of the expectation of doing comedy.

There’s no hiding from it: our society has been hellishly Alan SugaredHere’s a fun quiz: who is your favourite Apprentice candidate this year? Is it Dean, the sports agent who brags about having “the gift of the gab”? Is it Bryonn, the recruitment consultant who calls himself the Tank because he “destroys problems on any terrain”? Or what about Sophie, the account manager who said: “If B is for business, then I’m queen of the hive”?Spoiler: it’s none of them. That’s partly because I made the last two up, and partly because nobody in their right mind is excited about The Apprentice any more.Sure, I’ve tutted at The Apprentice for having the temerity to still exist before. But this time I can feel it. There’s something in the air. The Apprentice is now fully out of puff.The new series – the 15th – starts tonight, farted out unheralded on to a schedule that deserves better. And unless things take a record-breakingly enormous turn, it’s going to be the least auspicious series yet.The reasons are easy to pinpoint. The show is long in the tooth, and has been for at least half a decade. This has had a clear knock-on effect on the quality of the contestants. Take the youngest member of this year’s intake. He is Ryan-Mark, a “luxury womenswear consultant” who cites the Queen as his role model and calls himself “the epitome of luxury”. Ryan-Mark is 19 years old. The Apprentice has been on since he was four. He has grown up with it. It has been part of the fabric of his life from the moment he gained the ability to make memories. He has seen how it is less a showcase for genuine business aptitude, and more a glorified fishbowl where the public gets to jeer at pillocks for an hour a week. He knows this, and he still signed up. I’ve never met Ryan-Mark, so this isn’t rooted in fact, but I suspect that – since he knowingly signed up for this, despite everything – he might be a nitwit. But the problems go so much deeper this year. There is Alan Sugar, who is starting to look like a honking great liability for the BBC. His Twitter feed is an absolute minefield that, when it isn’t just a random jumble of spaces, misspellings and errant punctuation, takes a hammer to the notion of impartiality. Just last week he reacted to Paula Sherriff’s emotional address in the House of Commons by calling her a “ranting woman” who reminded him of “an insane person”. In a week when Naga Munchetty has been hauled across the coals for correctly being able to identify racism, his lazy boorishness looks even more abject than usual. It is starting to look as if double standards might be at play, which is the last thing the corporation needs right now.Mainly, though, there is the gaping hole where public enthusiasm used to be. Usually, when the BBC tweets out the candidate profiles each year, it dominates the news for a day or two as fans play Top Trumps with their silly hair and awful personalities. This year, it didn’t muster even a peep. This might be down to timing, because it happened at the exact moment when Lady Hale was gracefully dismantling Boris Johnson’s plans, but there is a bigger reason for it too.What, really, is the point of The Apprentice in 2019? Is it for the bearbaiting spectacle of watching a load of big-tied dumbos trying to force through their terrible ideas with a truckload of unearned confidence? Because we’ve got BBC Parliament for that now. Is it to give airtime to some of the most aggressively awful people in the country? Because that is the role Question Time now serves. Is it so we can watch business after business crater in the face of incompetence? Because surely that’s why people voted for Brexit.The ugly, swaggering, craven ineptitude of The Apprentice feels totally redundant in 2019, because it has been absorbed into society. It is all around us, and there is no hiding place. We don’t need to watch The Apprentice any more. We’re living it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e86bcd775bd0e0f2fd723b66e39d1cc2109ade/333_133_2839_1703/master/2839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de20135757a61a5dc0ef1fda137a1720","title":"israel pm benjamin netanyahu faces pre trial corruption hearing","story":"Leader also fighting to save political career after failing to secure election wins this yearDefence lawyers representing Benjamin Netanyahu are due to begin their arguments against looming bribery, fraud and breach of trust indictments as a long-awaited pre-trial hearing begins.Wednesday’s closed-door hearing, the culmination of three years of investigations, arrives at an especially fraught time for Israel’s longest-serving leader. Netanyahu is also fighting for his political life after failing to secure a clear win in two elections this year.Clinching the premiership for a historic fifth term is seen as a way to protect himself if indicted, as Israeli prime ministers are not required under law to step down unless they are ultimately convicted. That process could take months or even years.Political survival for Netanyahu is also potentially tied to his personal freedom as some of his parliamentary allies have suggested they would back laws to grant him immunity if he remains prime minister.Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a politically orchestrated “witch-hunt” to oust him from office.However, both the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, and the police have already suggested indictments are likely in three cases, including multiple fraud and breach of trust charges, and a bribery charge.He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.The first case, known as Case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, among them the Australian casino operator James Packer, allegedly in exchange for favours. In Case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country’s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.In the third and most damning, Case 4,000, Netanyahu is accused of offering incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns.The pre-trial hearing is not a court appearance, and Netanyahu is not expected to be present. Instead, it grants his legal team a last-ditch chance to convince the attorney general to either scrap or reduce the charges.Hearings are scheduled for Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday and Monday, but Mandelblit could delay his decision until December or even later. Even then, it could take months before his trial begins.Also on Wednesday, Netanyahu was hoping to meet his political rival Benny Gantz in an attempt to forge a unity deal between the two parties after a deadlocked 17 September election.However, Gantz’s Blue and White party released a statement on Tuesday evening saying he would not attend any meeting after negotiations between the two parties stalled.Netanyahu may be preparing to inform President Reuven Rivlin that he was unable to form a government. If he hands back the mandate, the president could ask Gantz to try, although he also does not command a majority in the Israeli parliament.With no apparent route out of the crisis, there is the possibility of a third national election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/268427f401b32c157c0f061351b18ccc6467be98/0_369_3974_2385/master/3974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=661616f67030d25c78025f5eb9b7f322","title":"north korea japan launches projectile ahead of us talks on weekend","story":"Tokyo reports no damage from incident before US-North Korea talks resume this weekendNorth Korea has fired what appeared to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile, in an apparent show of strength by Pyongyang before it resumes nuclear talks with the US at the weekend.Japan said the missile had landed inside its exclusive economic zone, adding that there were no immediate reports of damage to shipping or aircraft.South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff (JCS) said it had detected a ballistic missile fired from Wonsan, in Gangwon province, towards the sea. It travelled about 280 miles (450km) in an easterly direction at a maximum altitude of 910km.The missile was “believed to be one of the Pukkuksong models”, the JCS said in a statement, referring to a line of submarine-launched ballistic missiles North Korea was developing before it suspended long-range missile and nuclear tests and began denuclearisation talks with the US in 2018.The ability to reliably launch ballistic missiles from submarines would significantly expand North Korea’s military options, enabling it to deploy missiles far beyond the Korean peninsula and giving it a “second-strike” capability in the event of an attack on its military bases.Japan’s coastguard urged vessels in the area of the Japan Sea – known in Korea as the East Sea – to pay attention to further information and not to approach any debris.The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he “strongly condemned” the launch, adding that it violated UN security council resolutions. “We will continue to work closely with the United States and the international community, and do all we can to remain highly vigilant and protect the lives of the Japanese people,” he added.Tokyo had initially said that two ballistic missiles had been launched, but later said two sections of the same missile appeared to have crashed into the sea.The launch was the ninth since Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, met at the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas in June, and came soon after Pyongyang announced it would hold working-level talks with the US on Saturday – a development that could potentially break months of stalemate over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.Talks aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled since the second summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February ended without a deal.Trump has played down North Korea’s recent series of short-range launches, saying in September the US and North Korea “didn’t have an agreement on short-range missiles” and that many countries test such weapons.After supervising tests of what North Korea described as a “newly developed super-large multiple rocket launcher” last month, Kim was quoted by state media as saying the system would require a “running fire test” to complete its development.North Korea could also be demonstrating its anger after South Korea displayed some of its newly purchased US-made F-35 stealth fighter jets during its Armed Forces Day ceremony on Tuesday.North Korea has condemned the F-35 acquisitions as a grave provocation that violate recent inter-Korean agreements aimed at lowering military tensions.Harry J Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Centre for the National Interest, in Washington, said North Korea seemed to be “making its negotiating position quite clear” ahead of this weekend’s nuclear talks.He added: “North Korea’s message is clear: our capacity to cause trouble is increasing by the day. Pyongyang seems set to push Washington to back off from past demands of full denuclearisation for what are only promises of sanctions relief.“If talks do indeed fail once again, North Korea will conduct many more missile tests just like today – and perhaps nuclear weapons tests – driving tensions back to what could be another dangerous showdown.”It is not the first time North Korean missiles have landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone – it last happened in November 2017 – but short-range missiles launched in recent months have fallen short of the zone, which stretches 230 miles from the country’s coast"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Move would have far-reaching consequences for State-owned Coillte and Bord na M\u0026oacutenaSimon Harris tells Fianna F\u0026aacuteil TD 382 people waiting more than a month to leave facilitiesMore than 125,000 young people have registered online to attend eventsTorrential rain and gusts of more than 130kmh forecast by Met \u0026EacuteireannGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information on appearance of images in town popular with touristsGovernment will assist Northern Irish with cost of medical treatment in other EU statesInside Politics: Proposals appear to be like May\u0026rsquos time-limited backstop that was rejected by EU and IrelandT\u0026aacutenaiste says Government hasn\u0026rsquot seen plans yet but leaked details \u0026lsquono basis\u0026rsquo for deal\u0026lsquo I\u0026rsquove become increasingly alarmed at the way the people have found themselves going back into the trenches\u0026rsquoBreach of guidelines will trigger sanction of first charge on budgets, cautions Paul ReidWidespread concern voiced among business people and those living along the BorderRate is double that of Travellers in adult prisons, says Irish Prison ServiceManagement of child detention facility put the increase down to \u0026lsquobetter reporting\u0026rsquoFlanagan says those against direct provision should make clear how they would house those currently in centres around countryCabinet hears about tight parameters for budget due to potential no-deal BrexitDepartment reliant on private contractors to find accommodation for asylum seekers\u0026lsquoI am embarrassed and yes I am apologising for that on a daily basis,\u0026rsquo admits Jim DalyResidents are not offenders, but \u0026lsquoyoung people in conflict with the law\u0026rsquo, says deputy director"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4036910.1570001331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ban on alcohol on table as aviation sector targets unruly passengers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair has signed a joint declaration with others pledging to work to prevent and minimise disruptive incidents.A ban on serving alcohol on flights could be considered as a means to reduce the number of incidents of disruptive passenger behaviour, an Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) official has said. The safety of a European flight is compromised by unruly or disruptive passengers every three hours and an escalation of such incidents in recent years has promoted the Irish aviation sector to work together to curb bad behaviour in the air. At least once a month an in-flight situation reaches a point that sees a plane having to make an emergency landing.Unruly behaviour can include intoxication, aggressive or inappropriate behaviour as well as not following the commands of flight crew, who are there to protect passenger safety.Paul Brandon, the IAA’s head of corporate affairs, said it is accepted that alcohol was a contributory factor in a large number of these incidents, but the initial focus of the ‘Not On My Flight’ campaign would be to raise awareness of the actions that will be taken against disruptive passengers.When asked on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland if aviation authorities would consider banning alcohol on flights, Mr Brandon said “we will see if there is a need for further action.‘On the table’“It is absolutely on the table, but our preference is to focus on the awareness of the risk if they disrupt a flight,” he said. Ryanair, Aer Lingus, all the main airports, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and other airlines have signed a joint declaration pledging to work to prevent and minimise disruptive incidents on flights.They have agreed to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour where safety is put at risk and they have made a commitment to the responsible sale and consumption of alcohol. The declaration also promotes the ongoing education of and communication with passengers to continue to raise awareness of the risks associated with aggressive behaviour.The move comes as figures show there has been a dramatic increase in the number of disruptive passenger incidents on flights across Europe. According to data published by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), every three hours the safety of a flight within the EU is threatened by passengers demonstrating unruly or disruptive behaviour. Growing concernAlmost three quarters of aviation safety incidents across the EU involve some form of physical aggression and safety is compromised by unruly passengers on 1,000 flights in Europe per year due to assaults and alcohol related offenses. Mr Brandon said there was growing concern at the increasing frequency and severity of these incidents. “Between 2017 and 2018, the number of reported incidents of disruptive passengers on board flights across Europe increased by a third. This is worrying as it shows an increasing trend and can have a direct impact on both the safety of crew and passengers,” he said. “Even though the number of unruly passengers is small considering the total number of people flying, the impact of their actions can have a disproportionate effect both on the smooth operation of the flight and more importantly on its safety.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4036199.1569928977!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"from ophelia to ali five notable irish storms in recent years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStorm Ophelia: Gardaí clearing the road near Enniskerry from a fallen tree. Photograph: Cyril ByrneStorm OpheliaOctober 2017  Storm Ophelia made landfall over Ireland as an “extra-tropical storm” on the morning of October 16th, 2017, and brought wind speeds of 191kmh to parts of Ireland.The storm left more than 385,000 homes without power, caused coastal flooding while all schools and many businesses closed for the day.Three deaths were also attributed to Storm Ophelia Clare O’Neill (58) was killed when a tree struck her car in Co Waterford, Michael Pyke (31) was killed when he was using a chainsaw to clear a fallen tree in Co Tipperary and Fintan Goss (33) was killed when the car in which he was travelling in was struck by a tree in Co Louth.It is estimated Storm Ophelia caused almost €70 million worth of damage including emergency repair funds, ESB expenditure and cost of insurance payouts.The Beast from the East hit the country during the last week of February with more snow than had been seen since the 1980s. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pleaded for people to stay indoors as the weather system met Storm Emma and its 100kmh gales.All flights in and out of Dublin and Cork airports were cancelled, as were most forms of public transport. Schools were closed and supermarkets cleared as people stockpiled ahead of the red weather warning. The HSE cancelled all outpatient appointments and non-urgent surgeries for two days.A Lidl on Fortunestown Lane, Tallaght, was looted with a mechanical digger, which was used to take the roof off the building and lift out the safe.Storm Darwin hit Ireland on February 12th, 2014, with Shannon Airport recording a maximum gust of 160kmh. More than 215,000 homes lost power and there was also extensive coastal flooding and damage to buildings.Up to 7.5 million trees were blown down – between 5,000 and 7,000 hectares of forestry – which was about one per cent of the national total. Storm Darwin was one in a series of nine storms between 2013 and 2014 which caused at least five fatalities and hundreds of millions of euro in damage.Storm Desmond marked the onset of one of the wettest Irish winters on record. Desmond was the fourth of 10 such storms over November and December 2015, which led to severe flooding in the midlands and west along the banks of the Shannon and tributaries.The cost of damage to infrastructure was estimated at about €106 million, and the Government has committed €430 million towards increased flood relief measures from 2016 to 2022.Storm Ali hit the country on September 19th, 2018, bringing force 11 winds, with gusts on the west board reaching 142kmh, the highest level recorded since the Mace Head station in Co Galway opened in 2004.Elvira Ferraii from Switzerland died after the caravan she was staying in was blown onto a beach in Co Galway and electrician Matthew Campbell from Belfast died in the Slieve Gullion Forest Park after he was hit by a falling tree while working for the Northern Ireland Water Utility.The storm forced organisers of the Ploughing Championships in Tullamore, Co Offaly to cancel the second day of the three-day event and put on an extra day on the Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Arlene Foster hints she will back Boris Johnson’s plans as she says ‘let’s get a deal now’Woman climbs into New York zoo exhibit and dances in front of lionHong Kong flash-mob rallies erupt as anger mounts over shot protesterLawyer reveals 19-year-old British woman \u0026#39suffering from PTSD\u0026#39 on first day of trial over Cyprus \u0026#39rape\u0026#39Radio 4\u0026#39s Thought for the Day should be scrapped because it is discriminatory, says John HumphrysApprentice winners and candidates: what happened next?\u0026#39I\u0026#39m truly the reflection of perfection\u0026#39: the daftest Apprentice candidates of all time Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesThe Great British Bake Off 2019: Dessert Week recap - Is this the best ever game of Where\u0026#39s Wally?

Welcome mats made from life vests salvaged from the shores of the Mediterranean, which have been hand-stitched by women in detainment camps in Greece, are also on display.Created with Sketch.Best of Banksy Show all 68Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Banksy piece in California depicting a child wielding a machine gun, in black and white surrounded by colored flowersA rat on the clock of an old bank buildingNear the Oval BridgeThe piece, commissioned by this newspaper, is intended to represent a metaphor for the west\u0027s reluctance to tackle issues such as Aids in AfricaIn 2004, Banksy printed ‘one million pounds’ worth of his \u0027Tenners\u0027668 \u0027Love is in the Bin\u0027During Sotheby\u0027s Contemporary Art Sale on 5th October the Banksy artwork \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 shredded through the bottom of the frame as it was sold.

Mr Stephens said that the card company, who he refused to name, allegedly initiated the legal proceedings about 12 months ago.Although people will be able to visit the store for the next two weeks, its doors will never open and the lights will remain on 24 hours a day. Items on display in the shop, which are only available to buy online, range in price from a £10 signed spray paint can to a handbag made from a house brick.“The proceeds from these products will go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace the one confiscated by Italian authorities,” Banksy said.“So you may well be committing a criminal offence by purchasing them. Sometimes you go to work and it’s hard to know what to paint, but for the past few months I’ve been making stuff for the sole purpose of fulfilling trademark categories under EU law. It’s not a very sexy muse.”Other items for sale include disco balls made from used police riot helmets and a toddler’s counting toy where children are encouraged to load wooden migrant figures inside a haulage truck.Banksy said that despite trying to defend his artistic rights in this particular case, he has not changed his position on copyright.“I still encourage anyone to copy, borrow, steal and amend my art for amusement, academic research or activism. I just don’t want them to get sole custody of my name,” he said.Amongst the crowds gathered outside the shop on Tuesday was Janet Jones, 62, who lives locally.“It’s pretty incredible. The shop has been empty for a long while,” she said. “I’m pretty sure it was empty yesterday, It’s just happened so quickly.”Four security guards, dressed in brown trench coats, were stood outside the store. They told the Press Association\u0026nbspthat they did not know who they were working for or how long the job would last.Oliver Lewis, Croydon council’s cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport, said: “It’s really exciting, there’s a lot of people out here generating a lot of interest.“It just popped up overnight. That’s one of the great things about street art, it’s something for everyone to enjoy.”As previously reported by\u0026nbspThe Independent, the Banksy installation was spotted on Tuesday in south London. Located\u0026nbspin a formally derelict site beneath a PureGym in Croydon, and displays a number of different “rooms” including one showing a baby’s crib with CCTV cameras pointing at it.\u0026nbspThe “Stormzy vest” is accompanied by an explainer that reads: “A version of the ‘John Bull’ English gents waistcoat updated for modern times. This customised body armour is capable of stopping bullets up to .45 calibre and is fully stab proof.\u0026nbspEast Croydon-based music therapist Fraser Moyle, 29, was on his way to work when he spotted the installation, and said a friend who works nearby told him that work appeared to begin on Saturday 28 September. The downstairs part of the building had reportedly been derelict for months.\u0026nbsp“I immediately thought it could be a Banksy work due to the nature of the style, layout and political statements made in each window,” Mr Moyle told The Independent. “I spent the next half an hour staring in awe at the display! It’s amazing to have this artwork on show so close to home, and as a musician I think having Stormzy’s vest from Glastonbury in Croydon is special.”Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We worked closely with the Deaf community to develop a feature that would improve access to digital media.Speaking on stage at Google IO, CEO Sundar Pichai said: You can imagine all the use cases for the broader community too.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities. Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.”Meghan started the costly legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it “unlawfully” published a letter from her to her father Thomas Markle earlier this year.The Duchess insists the letter - which detailed her pain at their estrangement since the Wedding - was private.Law firm Schillings, representing the Duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .The legal proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court are being privately funded by Harry and Meghan.Depending on the court ruling, proceeds from any damages will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.In response to Harrys statement, Royal author and Prince Charles’ biographer Penny Junor said: “This is the most extraordinary statement and goes way beyond anything I have ever seen issued by a member of the royal family.“I completely understand that Harry should feel protective about his we and there have undoubtedly been some negative stories in the last nine months that must have hurt - but not exclusively in the Mail on Sunday - and they have not all been lies, nor I would suggest, part of a ruthless campaign.“The positive coverage of this last week in Africa is richly deserved.

The kind of very emotional, anti-press tirade... you dont expect it from a member of the Royal Family.I dont think this is the real Harry, I think he is being goaded into this by Meghan, who wants to be seeing only good press about herself. Its not the way it works.He doesnt want freedom of the press. He wants the press to be what he wants it to be.After being criticised by viewers on Twitter this morning, Morgan responded that he had lost his own father as a child.Harry released the explosive statement on the couples personal website last night.He said: I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.“I lost my mother and now I watch my we falling victim to the same powerful forces.”Harry said he and Meghan believed in “media freedom and objective, truthful reporting” as a “cornerstone of democracy”.But he added: “Unfortunately, my we has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against iniduals with no thought to the consequences - a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.“There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specically when it is knowingly  and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face - as so many of you can relate to - I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been.“Because in today’s digital age, press fabrications are repurposed as truth across the globe. One day’s coverage is no longer tomorrow’s chip-paper.”Harry, who is represented by high-powered London legal firm Harbottle  Lewis who have made several complaints to newspapers on his behalf, also claimed the couple had been unable to correct “continual misrepresentations” in the press.He also even questioned the positive newspaper coverage the couple have enjoyed during their current Southern African tour.The Duke and Duchess have been pictured every day since last week attending a series of events to highlight good causes close to their hearts.Each visit has been crafted by a team of public relations experts to help improve their image.That included Harry’s visit to land mine fields in Angola - just like Diana did in the s and a rare public appearance by their baby son Archie.But the Prince claimed this “positive” coverage of himself and Meghan on the tour exposed “the double standards” of the press.He added: “She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you’ve seen on this Africa tour.“I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.”Meghan started the costly legal action against the Mail on Sunday newspaper over an allegation it “unlawfully” published a letter from her to her father Thomas Markle earlier this year.The Duchess insists the letter - which detailed her pain at their estrangement since the Wedding - was private.Law firm Schillings, representing the Duchess, said she had filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information, infringement ofand breach of the Data Protection Act .The legal proceedings in the Chancery Division of the High Court are being privately funded by Harry and Meghan.Depending on the court ruling, proceeds from any damages will be donated to an anti-bullying charity.“The positive coverage of this last week in Africa is richly deserved. This feels to me like an over-emotional and somewhat ill- advised outburst.”A Mail on Sunday spokesman said: The Mail on Sunday stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.Specically, we categorically deny that the Duchess’s letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.We pay for your stories!

We are already living in it.We are the frog in the water and its already been brought to the boil.

I think part of the group discussion that we had earlier is what is offsetting CO.The Duchess of Sussex has revealed the schedule for her first trip to South Africa was based around a special person in her le – baby son Archies feeding times.In an interview given on the penultimate day of Meghan and Harrys visit to southern Africa, the duchess also said she missed her husband so much while he was away on a solo tour of the region.She described being in South Africa for the first time as a really powerful experience.And speaking about her formal role with the Commonwealth family, she said the  that came with the position was something she took incredibly seriously.Quizzed about how the trip has been as a family, Meghan replied: On my goodness, well, were doing well.I think the schedule – they have been very kind to me, because everything is based around Archies feed times.So its a full plate, but were making it work. Its worth it.The couple have spent the past nine days visiting southern Africa and raising issues they are passionate about including wildle conservation and female empowerment.Last night Harry revealed his we Meghan has launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday.In a y statement published on the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs website, Harry alleged the paper had unlawfully published a letter from her to her father Thomas Markle.Meghan Markle insists the letter - which detailed her pain at their estrangement since the Royal Wedding - was private.In a statement revealing the legal action, Prince Harry claimed the couple were suffering from the painful impact of relentless propaganda against Meghan.But royal commentators questioned his comments.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us. But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions. Then someone from production let her out and the problems really started.Two minutes into her act, Vicki came to a grinding halt and stuttered: “I . . . I . . . I changed everything I was going to do.” And decided to shove any good material down the caravan’s chemical toilet A horribly awkward moment for everyone, though not the first sign the booking process had seriously maled with this episode.That was the previous act – Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh, from Kazakhstan, whose “ceremony of sound” went where your iPhone alarm fears to tread, making the sort of random animal noises usually accompanied by the caption “footage courtesy of PETA”.British politeness rescued him from the silence that should have followed – along with David Walliams, who said: “People are not going to forget the name . . . sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.”What I definitely will remember about Saturday’s episode, though, is the timely question Simon Cowell posed to the act that followed Gennady and Vicki, Twist  Pulse: “The people who didn’t want to compete again.

The biggest impact has been emotional.Officers made a breakthrough on September , , when traffic cops monitoring an uninsured car on the M watched as a bag containing jewellery, stolen from a home in Solihull, was thrown from a window.Zaharia was arrested and his DNA taken which later matched to a blood stain found at a burglary.Police intelligence linked Zaharia to an address in Oldbury and on December  cops executed a warrant at the house where all five were detained.Bundles of cash and stolen jewellery was also recovered – as well as £, in Spiru’s handbag – alongside burglary “paraphernalia” including several pairs of rubber grip gloves and tools.Sgt Sandy Thompson said: “This group has been responsible for untold heartache, worry and inconvenience among hundreds of residents across the region. It’s one of the biggest burglary conspiracies we’ve ever seen in the West Midlands.We’ve linked them directly to  burglaries where £, and property valued at £, was taken – but we suspect they’ve committed far more offences and taken cash and valuables worth millions of pounds. Four or five hundred is a conservative estimate.They were ruthlessly organised: they would scope out homes in affluent areas, wait till nightfall and strike at addresses with the lights off that appeared unoccupied.“They always broke in via first floor windows to avoid alarm sensors on the ground floor, to get straight into bedrooms where valuables were likely to be kept and even took jewellery testing kits with them to test the purity of gold items at the scene.The group made regular money transfers to family members back home via Oldbury post office and other outlets.We also found lots of photos showing friends and family in Romania posing in expensive jewellery taken from homes in our communities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"woman leg gash young farmers ball","story":"The -year-old suffered the gaping wound to her leg at the dinner dance event at Tillington Hall Hotel, Stafford, on Friday, September .Cops have now launched a probe and are trawling CCTV in a bid to get to the bottom of mystery incident which left one member of Eccleshall YFC needing several stitches.The woman suffered a deep cm cut to the back of her right leg at around .pm - but it not yet known what happened.She was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where the wound was stitched together but has since been released.Staffordshire Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs has now released a statement.A spokesman said: We are saddened that one of its YFC members was injured during Eccleshall Young Farmers’ Clubs’The YFC member involved has received hospital treatment and is now back home with her family.We are in contact with the YFC member and their family to support them during this dficult time.

The shop, called Gross Domestic Product, sells artwork including le vests washed up on the shores of the Mediterranean that were hand-stitched by women in Greek migrant camps. Banksy says he has been forced to open the shop following a legal dispute with a greeting card company. Mark Stephens, an arts lawyer and founder of the Design and ArtistsSociety, described the row as frankly ludicrous litigation.It began after a card company tried to sell Banksy merchandise, forcing the mysterious street artist to produce his own in order to avoid someone  claiming the trademark, My London reports.   Although people will be able to visit the store for the next two weeks, its doors will never open and the lights will remain on  hours a day. Mr Stephens said: Banksy is in a dficult position because he doesnapost produce his own range of shoddy merchandise and the law is quite clear:the trademark holder is not using the mark, then it can be transferred to someone who will. As a solution to the issue, Mr Stephens proposed that Bansky launch his own range of merchandise and open a shop.  The artist said: The proceeds from these products will go towards buying a new migrant rescue boat to replace the one confiscated by Italian authorities.

Adam Lewis, , was attacked outside the Hope and Anchor in Liverpool City Centre by thug Anthony Hart,  - now serving  months in jail for inflicting GBH. Adam, a University of Liverpool music lecturer, explained how since the attack in December last year, he has had to endure months of medieval torture after surgeons wired his jaw shut - forcing him to eat his Christmas dinner through a straw. But the University of Liverpool music lecturer was left reeling when he realised nerve damage to his bottom lip meant kissing his girlfriend no longer felt the same. Adam has since been dealing with the effects of post-traumatic stress disordersince Hartaposs attack. Bass player Adam, who moved to Liverpool from his home in Essex  years ago, told the Liverpool Echo the assault has left him with a loss of sensation and sometimes he finds himself in tears at his ordeal. He said: It really upset me. When we first got together that was one of the things [my partner] said aposyouaposre a really good kisserapos. It was one of those things, you feel great, you walk with a swagger, you know     But even now, on a personal level, it just doesnapost feel the same because of the nerve damage on my bottom lip. I also drool when I eat, I drool when I drink. They are my two vices, I like to eat and go out for meals, and I like to have a drink. I will save up and go out for a nice meal, but now I am self conscious about it.Even having a pint in the Philarmonic, I will be thinking oh have I spilled something, have I got Guinness in my beard, are people looking. The recovery process was long and traumatic, and Adam even had to carry around a pair of wire cutters at all times in case he vomited, meaning he would have to cut the wires in his jaw to avoid choking to death. Adam told the newspaper he was not ashamed to admit he had found himself in tears for no reason. He said: The day after I got the wires cut, me and [my partner] were sitting in Cafe Tabac on Bold Street. I started smiling and she started crying. She said aposyou have not smiled in seven weeksapos, and it was because every time I tried to smile for a split second there was a sharp piece of metal sticking into my lip. That got me, and I was like f****** hell. That was the onset of the psychological effects really. I canapost really explain it, I would break down in tears for no reason.    It is only in the last couple of weeks that I have got a grip on it, although I cried when I got the phone call about the sentence. I would be walking around the Park Road Tesco with a basket full of shopping and just break down in tears, I would have to drop the basket and just run out. Since the wires in his jaw were removed with pliers - a painful and bloody process - he has been on a y waiting list to see a psychiatrist and has been prescribed medication which he said did not help. Adamaposs memories of the incident are patchy thanks to the concussion he suffered, but he says he had only had around two pints and did not feel intoxicated at all. He said he was enjoying a night in the Hope and Anchor with his partner, and another couple they were friends with. Earlier in the night he said Hart and his friend Carl Murray, both joiners who had been working on a building site near the pub, had been mocking his Essex accent, although he had just laughed it off. However later on the pair began insulting Adam and his friends again, which escalated when one of the assailants made a vile, sexual comment towards his friendaposs partner. He says his friend and the two thugs squared up to each other and Murray threw a punch, but CCTV played in court showed Adam moving in to act as the peacemaker.    He said: I told the other lad to take his friend and go home, and the next thing I know I was punched in the back of the head. From what I have been told by the police officers and others heaposs punched me and as I am on my hands and knees heaposs volleyed me in the jaw like [rugby player] Jonny Wilkinson. The bone was snapped on both sides. Adam says he was taken to Aintree Hospital AE where he had to wait five hours for stronger pain relief than paracetamol, because he had been drinking. He said: I am not afraid to say I was crying from the pain for about three or four days constantly. The worst part was when I got the news my jaw had been wired shut. Adam says initially surgeons had hoped to repair the injury in theatre, but the unusual nature of the break to the right side of his jaw meant it was necessary to wire it shut. He says his attacker was wearing work-gear, and surgeons said due to the nature of the injury he was most likely wearing a steel-toe cap boot or similar. He said: My mum came up and took me back to Essex. I have a lot of friends up here but thereaposs nothing quite like being around your mum and dad when something like this happens. I was on a liquid diet and I lost two stone. I couldnapost eat anything with any lumps in, I couldnapost even drink smoothies, it had to be pure liquid.    Adam, who plays in several bands and is well known in the city centre pub scene for gigs and quiz nights he hosts, says he was nervous about the court process. He said: I am not a violent person, I am a lover not a hater. I have a squeaky clean criminal record and I am a bass player, I am not going to risk damaging my hands by going around fighting. I can hand on heart say I have never instigated a fight in my le. I didnapost want to go through the court process, and I thinkthey had turned around after a couple of weeks and said it was out of character, I am sorry, hereaposs some money for your lost earnings I wouldnapost have minded dropping the charges. But they pleaded not guilty initially and I am not a hard man to find, you start to worry about reprisals and things and I am not that way inclined.

Martyn Evans, , was found dead on a sofa hours just hours after drinking heavily with four friends. The two men and two women decided to have a bit of fun at his expense and filmed their treatment of Martyn, including trying to shave his eyebrows. They poured bleach and washing-up liquid on his head - and put a banana up his nostril.An inquest at Avon Coroneraposs Court heard Martyn was more intoxicated than the rest of the group, and was clearly out of it on the sofa as the antics went on.A coroner said: I find the behaviour of these four iniduals towards Martyn, a vulnerable man, to be appalling.    After attempting to wash some of the bleach out of Martynaposs hair, the group then carried him back to the sofa to sleep - and found him dead there just hours later. The four people involved - aged between  and  - pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court in August this year to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They were each handed an -month community order, with rehabilitation, but their bullying actions were not linked to Martynaposs death. Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing recorded a short narrative conclusion at Martynaposs inquest - stating that he was unable to determine how the young man came by his death. The inquest heard that Martyn, who lived in Withywood, Bristol, had a long history of learning and developmental dficulties. On October , , the night before his death, he had gone with two friends to the home of another two of their friends in Highridge, Bristol, for an evening of drinking. According to one female member of the group, who claimed she was not drinking that night, Martyn and the other three drank around  cans between them, the inquest heard. When paramedics from South-West ambulance service were called to the address in Highridge shortly after .am the following morning, they found Martyn in a state of rigamortis on the sofa. Mr Harper said he spoke to Martynaposs friend who lived in the house, who seemed visibly distressed and very shaken. The man explained that Martyn had come round the night before with another friend and that Martyn had been drinking Stella Artois beer throughout the night. He told Mr Harper he was not sure how much Martyn had consumed, but he was drunk, and at am, the man had helped him to the sofa to sleep, the inquest heard. He said that he next saw Martyn when he walked into the sitting room at .am and found him dead. The inquest heard that PC Matthew Stanford and Sergeant Lisa Colton, of Avon and Somerset Police, then attended the scene. The two officers entered the sitting room and saw Martyn on his back on the sofa, covered with a white duvet, and with vomit stains on his upper jeans, the neckline of his t-shirt, and the soles of his socks.  They then concluded that Martynaposs death was a tragic accident, and that he could have choked on his own vomit after being left to sleep on his back whilst extremely drunk, the inquest heard.

The xs have been drafted in because organisers were unable to locally obtain cars suitable for the royal couple and their baby son Archie. It is understood that the cars for the trip were offered by Jaguar Land Rover, and were transported at no cost to the taxpayer. A palace source said it was due to security concerns to transport the royals. The manufacturer has provided vehicles for the royal family for decades, including on foreign visits.    Meghan was pictured today arriving in a British-registered blue Range Rover during her visit to the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Aides and personal protection officers have been seen in four Land Rover Discovery vehicles, four green and one blue. Harry and Meghan faced criticism in August after reportedly taking four private jet journeys in  days, rather than opting for commercial flights, despite speaking out on environmental issues. The Duke has previously said that he would have a maximum of two children due to his concerns about climate change.    Speaking for a special edition of British Vogue in August, Harry said: “What we need to remind everybody is: These are things that are happening now. We are already living in it. “We are the frog in the water and it’s already been brought to the boil. Which is terrying.” In September, Harry defended the couple’s “occasional” private flights and said they were necessary to keep his family safe.

The former actress said the country was at a “crisis state”.    Women have taken to the streets in their thousands to protest against the growing levels of violence against women in South Africa, where rape is being used as a weapon. During a meeting at the organisation Action Aid, which campaigns for social justice, Meghan said more needed to be done to educate men and boys on the subject. She said: “It is at a crisis state here and the age range that it is happening at is really staggering. “In terms of going into their homes, behaviour and having that interaction with the parents as well, especially the patriarch, to be able to sht what that conversation is like  Bafana Khumalo talked to the duchess about patriarchy and the levels of violence against women by men and how there was an acceptance in South Africa that they could do this without impunity. “We must challenge men and hold them accountable for their actions”, he said. “And boys”, Meghan interjected.

Risk of some strong winds, gales in places, some heavy rainfall as well, and some big seas. Parts of Ireland are expected to feel the worst of Lorenzoaposs impact with Met Eireann saying there will be signicant storm and wave surges around coastal areas.   Met Eireann has also warned some areas may experience thunderstorms which could lead to flooding, reports the Irish Mirror. The Met Office said there has been some uncertainty over its path, but it now looks like it will follow a north-easterly track towards the UK and Ireland. When it arrives in these latitudes some time on Thursday, it will have lost its hurricane strength, but will still mean another wet and windy battering for the west of the country. Chief meteorologist at the Met Office Dan Suri said: There has been considerable uncertainty over the potential track of Lorenzo after it passes The Azores. However, we are now increasingly confident the remnants of Lorenzo will move towards the UK, bringing a spell of wet and very windy weather to western parts on Thursday and Friday. Mr Suri said the strongest winds are expected in western Ireland, with a risk of coastal gales developing in Northern Ireland and western Scotland on Thursday and Wales and south-west England on Friday.    He said ex-Lorenzo will also bring spells of heavy rain to north-western parts of the UK through Thursday and Friday, particularly in Northern Ireland, western Scotland, central England and Wales. Mr Suri said: Our advice is to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next couple of days and to keep an eye out for any weather warnings that may be issued in your area. Deputy chief meteorologist Tony Wardle said: The remnants of ex-Hurricane Lorenzo will gradually pull away from the UK later on Friday, though itaposll remain unsettled with further spells of wet and windy weather as we head into the weekend. The arrival of ex-Lorenzo will mean more rainfall after days of deluge, although the Met Office said Wednesday will be an oasis of good weather between the storms.

It is believed the unidentied woman bypassed a wooden safety barrier and stepped into the enclosure. In the clip, the zoo visitor, wearing a blue t-shirt, can be seen standing in front of the lion as she dances and waves at the animal. The lion does not move and watches her curiously while she taunts him. Between the two, there is a small moat which keeps them separated and the woman does not seem to be in immediate danger. The video was filmed by another visitor on Saturday.   Following the incident, the woman was escorted out of the zoo, CBS News reports.Police are now on the hunt for her, saying she might face criminal trespassing charges. A spokesperson of Bronx Zoo said: Barriers and rules are in place to keep both visitors, staff and animals safe.  We have a zero tolerance policy on trespass and violation of barriers. A visitor to the zoo reacted to the video, telling CBS: I think it is absolutely crazy, I donapost know why anyone would think to climb over there.

The Melbourne resident had high hopes the product would give her the boost she desired after seeing rave reviews and videos online. And after applying them to her meatless lost dreams of hopeshe felt like a new woman, even comparing herself to Baywatch stunner Pam.

Suddenly my t*t bunnies’ ears were hanging forward as they had slipped off, hanging down my top.  Laura, who said it made her look like sheaposd had a stroke, was left with one perfect looking shoulder boulder and the other looking like a bacon hanger. She desperately tried to press down the sticker, but to no avail. She added: I went to the bathroom where I decided I was going to take them off so I wasn’t so noticeably uneven, and let my nipple holsters just hang like a couple of monkeys off a tree...except, the left one didn’t want to budge. Like at all... I’m in a very busy toilet cubicle trying to rip these things off my Danny Davitos and I can feel my left nipple wanting to peel off with it. It sounded like I was giving birth as I felt all the hair I’d ever had on my chest and been teased for as a teen was being ripped from my skin and my areolas were being slowly removed like chocolate ripple biscuits ready to be dipped in coffee.  "},{"url":null,"title":"plane passengers shocked couples very","story":"NewsPlane passengers shocked by couple’s very strange seating positionThe horrying picture shows a womans bare foot lying on the armrest of a passenger in front of herShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsTwo passengers were shamed for lack of basic manners onboard a recent flight\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Here are the brave youngsters fighting this battle: Ridhima Pandey, , In spite of her tender years, Ridhima, from Haridwar, India, already has experience at taking on governments. In , aged just nine, she sued the Indian government for not doing enough to tackle climate change. She said: I want a better future. I want to save my future. I want to save our future. I want to save the future of all the children and all people of future generations.

That was the perfect scenario so, hopefully, we can get back to that.“I don’t think, however, that we can take anything away from Lawrence and play down how good he has been considering every new singing is a gamble.“He has been perfect for us so far.”Former Rangers, Wigan and Motherwell forward Lee also heaped praise on young striker Louis Appere for his performances to date.And the former Killie gaffer believes the -year-old is already a better player than he was at that age.“I think he is a wee bit better than me, to be honest,” Lee added. “I would say that, especially at the age he is at.“I am a big fan of Louis.

Our candidate in the Bridge of Don by-election has been fighting hard to retain this service for the local community.“The reduction in frequency on many services across the city is concerning. Good quality public transport is essential for many of our citizens.”And SNP group leader Stephen Flynn added: “My constituents have told me they regard the revised hourly service on the  between Cove and Kincorth as a ‘token gesture’ and it’s almost impossible to disagree.“I’m deeply sceptical about how it can be expected to operate successfully and really fear that it will ultimately be cut completely as was initially planned.“I’ve made robust representations directly to senior management at First in the hope that these changes could be put on hold.“But ultimately they have decided to proceed and there is very little that can now be done.“I do hope that First will improve engagement and be upfront about where routes are in dficulty.“Proposing wholesale changes without prior warning and with only a short consultation period doesn’t do anyone any favours.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Drawing in a crowd from across Mid Argyll the band put on show to remember but it was just as memorable for the band. A sea of die-hard fans, in Robert Robertson masks, certainly took the singer by surprise as the group made their way to the front of the stage for a dance.The gig was in aid of Clachan Village Hall and organisers were thrilled that the concert was once again a sold-out event.The local pubs and hotels were quickly filled up to continue the party. As a warm up for their main stage gig on Sunday, The Mad Ferret Band drew in the crowds at The Corner House, while Gubbed had the Islay Frigate dance floor well used as they rocked the night away.The jam session in the harbour marquee on Saturday afternoon brought together a host of musicians, while a fantastic £. for festival funds was raised at the coffee morning held at Templar Arts and Leisure Centre.The Mad Ferret Band eased the Sunday survivors into the day’s event at the quay but it was not long before the crowd were back on their feet dancing and singing along. The great musical entertainment continued throughout the afternoon with performance from Gary Innes and Rhuvaal.Speaking after the weekend-long event, organiser Margaret MacNeill said: #Thanks to everybody who helped out with the coffee morning. Special thanks also to all the bands and everyone who came to support Tarbert Music Festival. Saturday was busier than ever, helped by the good weather.#Tide Lines brought something special to the weekend and the gig was sold out well in advance, so look out for more ticketed events in future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow health wrangle could add 1m to argyll overspend","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn overspend of more than £million is being forecast by health chiefs in Argyll and Bute for the current financial year – but health services are currently almost half a million in the black.The biggest threat to the year-end spending figures is a long-running dispute with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over charges for services.The figures were revealed in a report presented to members of the area’s Health and Social Care Partnershipintegration joint boardon Wednesday September .The HSCP was operating at an overspend of £, as of July , but while £, has been overspent on social work services, health has an underspend of £,.The vast majority of the projected overspend for   is on social work, at £.m, with a further £.m forecast to be overspent on health.Addressing the figures for the year to date, head of finance and transformation Judy Orr said: #Within health delivered services, the underspend is mainly due to successful appeal of rateable values following the last revaluation, rebates received and vacancy savings.#There are overspends on adult services linked to savings not being achieved in addition to increased costs for agency locum staff and GP prescribing.#There is also an overspend as we have not yet met our target for slippage on budget reserves which includes one-off, in-year allocations.#Within social work the overspends are mainly on learning disability joint residential and supported living and physical disability supported living arising due to service demands.#Within learning disability, the iance is caused by a failure to deliver planned savings along with spend above budgeted levels.#There are some offsetting underspends on central management costs within children and families and child protection due to staffing underspends and some slippage on expenditure and underspends on adult services central management costs due to phasing and reduced demand.#Efforts have been made in July to phase budgets more closely in line with historic patterns of expenditure and expected trends and to increase the correlation with the forecast.#On health, the underspend has increased by £, and continues the trend experienced in the first quarter. The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting. An odd sighting was that of an Albatross species flying north but it looks as though no one  picked it up."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-set-turn-back-time-weekend-festivals","story":"SELKIRK is set to turn back time this weekend.The ever-popular Scotts Selkirk will take place for the th time throughout Saturday.And organisers have even added extra attractions by coinciding the Georgian celebrations with the toe-tapping Selkirk Sessions and the monthly Farmers Market.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"Having started as a millennium project, this is the th time we have run the event.\"We would like to thank all our volunteers, performers and supporters who have helped us over the years to reach this milestone.\"The main streets in Selkirk will again be transformed into the days when Sir Walter dispensed justice from his courtroom.Period costumes are still available for hire from the events Market Place shop.As well as traditional entertainment, which includes puppeteers, dancers, musicians and performing animals, there will be an array of traditional childrens games on offer, such as splat-the-rat and a coconut shy.Fare from the th century will be served up at Meg Dods Kitchen, and Sir Walter willto the bench to deliberate over a couple of cases.Scotts Selkirk runs throughout Saturday, while the cream of local talent will take to stages in pubs and clubs around the town for the Selkirk Sessions from Friday evening through to Sunday.A car boot sale has also been organised for the Market Place on Sunday.Viv added: \"Our performers include GaelForce, Carlenjig, Riddell Fiddles, Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, and Bob Liddle.\"We are again really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane-lorenzo-bring-travel-disruption-icy-temperatures-60mph-winds","story":"Freezing temperatures followed by mph winds are forecast as the remnants of Hurricane Lorenzo passes over the UK.The Met Office is warning of transport disruption and power cuts in Northern Ireland, South West England and Wales on Thursday and Friday.It said the storm, which is due to hit Northern Ireland on Thursday, is expected to bring heavy rain and wind speeds of up to mph in coastal areas.It comes as the latest Met Office figures show that UK rainfall was % above average for September, with .mm falling during the month, compared to the .mm average.#Lorenzowill bring a swathe of strong winds to Northern Ireland on Thursday, stay #weatherawarepic dcxbNqSqLmdash Met OfficeOctober , Despite the downpour, the Environment Agency declared a drought in Hertfordshire and north London on Tuesday ndash when much of the country was experiencing flash flooding.The Met Office said Wednesday is forecast to be dry for most of the UK, with some showers in northern and eastern coastal areas.But temperatures are due to drop to freezing in some parts of England overnight due to the arrival of ldquocool air from the north, Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said.ldquoOvernight on Wednesday, because we will have had this long clear spell, we might see some rural frost and temperatures drop to freezing in central and eastern areas, Ms Maxey said.ldquoHowever, this will be localised, it is not widespread.A yellow severe weather warning for #windhas been issued: https:t.co QwDLMfRBfs.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and naivety from mainstream media risks increasing our environmental footprint.’Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions which NSA say is, again, misleading.Mr Stocker added: ‘Methane shouldn’t be ignored it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise. It was worth having the grand dame on after all."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tories-back-spring-election-capitalise-snp-turmoil-following-salmond-trial","story":"The plea to the Prime Minister came as the partyrsquos annual conference in Manchester heard another major spending announcement: a plan to raise the national living wage to pound. an hour by  unveiled by Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, as he sought to move the conference spotlight away from allegations surrounding Mr Johnsons private le.The further sign that an election is on its way has prompted Scottish Tory MPs to urge the PM to rule out a December poll and wait until next year to go to the country, preferably in the spring.:Opposition parties reject SNPs bid for snap no-confidence vote as rt remainsSome party insiders argue that, apart from avoiding the effects of a bad winter in Scotland, holding an election in March  could bring electoral benefits for the Conservatives in their battle with Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP following the high-profile Salmond court case.One senior Scottish Tory source told The Herald: ldquoIrrespective of the outcome of the trial, the Nationalists will be in turmoil.In his set-piece speech, Mr Javid told conference that his \"ambitious\" proposal - which as well as a rise in the amount of the living wage would also see the age threshold lowered to cover all workers aged over  - would give four million people a pay rise.He explained he wanted the national living wage to be raised to match two-thirds of median earnings, which would represent a p hourly increase in .\"Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether,\" declared the Chancellor.But Mr Javid said the Government wanted to reward the hard work of millennials and bring down the age threshold to cover all workers over .But John McDonnell, his Labour Shadow, dismissed the announcement, saying: ldquoThis pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said: ldquoBusiness shares the Chancellors ambition to end low pay. Increasing productivity is the only way to sustainable pay rises.She stressed the success of the independent Low Pay Commission was due to its evidence-based approach to increasing wages without damaging job prospects.\"The Commission will work bestit retains the ability to judge the pace and affordability of any future wage rises,\" insisted Dame Carolyn.\"But the Chancellors pre-election promise should be taken with a huge bucket of salt, she declared.\"This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit. If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer,\" added Ms OrsquoGrady.In his speech, Mr Javid claimed the Government was bringing in a \"decade of renewal\" after the \"decade of recovery\" under the last Labour government, promising an \"infrastructure revolution\" with investment in roads, buses and broadband.The Chancellor also allocated pound million to create a new Youth Investment Fund to roll out youth centres and services to help young people \"get on the conveyor belt to a better le and career\" during the next five years. This would produce a consequential of almost poundm for the Scottish Government.It has been estimated that the UK Governmentrsquos planned spending in the next decade would top pound billion, meaning Edinburgh could expect to receive nearly poundbn under the Barnett Formula.:Boris Johnson attacked over plan to sideline Nicola SturgeonAnd Mr Javid announced plans to bring forward a White Paper on further devolution in England, saying the Government wanted to give more local powers to local people \"to drive investments in the infrastructure and services they know they need\".Earlier, Mr Johnson was asked about journalist Charlotte Edwardes claim that he had squeezed her thigh at a private lunch at The Spectator magazines HQ shortly after he became editor in .During a visit to a business in Manchester the PM was askedhe had done it. \"No, he declared, adding: ldquoWhat the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country.\"This morning, Mr Johnson is set to be grilled again on the subject when he is due to appear on BBC Radiorsquos Today programme ahead of his keynote speech to conference tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-went-private-school-didnt-want-children","story":"The problem was, at , I was three weeks into my first year at a private school. Word had reached the highest level that there was \"a person with views\" in S. As I walked down a pitch black, -metre-long corridor, I remained steadfastly sure that my wide-ranging research , and in-depth questioningwould see me through this momentary hiccup in creating this seemingly seditious pamphlet .But, in the four minutes it took for the red traffic light at the end of the tunnel of doom, to turn to green, and the Heidiersquos voice to boom ldquoCome!, I wobbled. Yes itrsquos true! I was indeed a dirty socialist interloper sent from a s housing estate state primary school to this small, all-girl, private school to undermine it and ultimately bring about its collapse.When it came to thinking about schools for my own children, surprisingly the simplicity of my survey did not help. I talked to other parents. One friend, who I visited on a sunny April morning at her and her husbandrsquos six-bedroom house, complete with a Porsche  gleaming in the driveway, told me that they were sending their children to the local state school because they felt school was not just about academics.ldquoItrsquos about learning le lessons, coming across a range of people, problems and lsquostuffrsquo so that real le doesnrsquot come as a massive surprise.But then there was another friend of mine in Perth who is an NHS worker. She stridently told me she would rather starve than not have sent her son to private school for the last  years. She herself had been a quiet child who had struggled in a large state primary school and fell behind, before being moved to our private school.ldquoThere were months mum couldnrsquot pay, but the school helped out. Yes, I was at school with girls who had race horses in the front garden, but I didnrsquot feel any dferent.She found it hard to catch up with her reading and writing. ldquoI didnrsquot want that for my son, who was quite introverted as well. It had been exceptionally hard for her to pay the fees for his school. She paused before adding ldquoRemember all those times I couldnrsquot come to Glasgow to see you girls  Well that was because I didnrsquot have the money to put petrol in the car.I could see a little of what my friend was so passionate about: I really admired the seemingly over-arching confidence of the girls I had been at school with. I craved that confidence for my children. We were a purposeful, articulate and loyal bunch. We stretched our wings in the sciences, creative writing and Latin.We were surprisingly erse too - from the children of the inherited rich to the daughters of the just-recently-got rich. From the off-spring of immigrants whorsquod arrived with a fiver in their pockets to the few girls who faced abuse walking through some of Glasgowrsquos poorer areas to get to the school, we were quite a motley crew.As a Muslim, I was proud to inform my parents that my best friends were a Jew and a Christian. We confidently asserted ourselves, and expressed our ideas freely, perhaps without fear of what any boys in the class might think of us. Most,not all, of us assumed we would go to university or college and then onto work.But I often wonderedour confidence was a bit like our school unorm, and indeed our accents - something we put on, to homogenise us, to make us a type, maybe to cover up or compensate for any wee shortcomings we might have had.We were also utterly terried of the kids from the local state school. They sat on a wall nonchalantly eating chips as we walked by, but we actually thought they wanted to kill us - a perfect example of how a lack of contact, breeds fear. It floors me to think that,  years later, a close friend and colleague, Kate, who I cannot even contemplate starting a work project without, was one of those chip-eating lsquoterrorsrsquo.I knew that sort of insularity and lack of, as I saw it, iniduality was not what I wanted for my own children.Ultimately, both had six years at state school, having encountered young people from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and abilities, accents and sensibilities.I watch them in their workplaces interact with customers with an ease I could have only dreamt of. They describe nights out that involve skillful de-escalations of potentially dficult situations with groups of other young men in the street.They are quietly confident but always attuned to the group dynamic. Most importantly I value their iniduality, and their determination to go against the flow or fashion. They may not have particular loyalties to their old school tie, but perhaps thats not a bad thing."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-urged-live-rhetoric-ban-fracking","story":"Scottish ministers are preparing to make a statement to Holyrood on Thursday addressing thecontroversial process.It comes two years after SNP energy minister Paul Wheelhouse announced an ldquoeffective ban on the industry.The Scottish Governmentrsquos own lawyers later argued this was ldquothe language of a press statement during a court case brought by petrochemical giant Ineos.James Mure QC said ministers had simply announced a ldquopreferred position on the issue.A moratorium on fracking has been in place since , and the SNP previously delayed making a final decision on whether to outlaw the industry.Mary Church, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: ldquoMinisters must live up to their rhetoric and fulfil the promises of two years ago by committing to a full legal ban on fracking that will put this issue to bed once and for all.ldquoThe effective ban announced two years ago has been exposed in court as having no legal force and was described by the Scottish Governmentrsquos own legal team as merely lsquothe language of a press releasersquo.ldquoAn expert legal opinion from earlier this year shows that not only is it well within the power of the Scottish Government to ban fracking, but that legislating would be a far more effective way to stop the industry and defeat any further legal challenges from companies like INEOS who want to frack the central belt.\"We are in the middle of a climate crisis, and now is the time for tough decisions to lay the framework for the system change we need to make happen over the next decadewe are to avoid outright catastrophe.\"A full legal ban on fracking will be much harder for a future minority government to overturn and will send a strong signal to the fossil fuel industry that its days are numbered.\"The Scottish Government has announced a climate emergency - it now needs to start acting like it means it.\"That includes taking a much tougher stance with big, polluting corporations, ending its support for new oil and gas and using the powers it has to pass strong laws in the Scottish Parliament to drive the transformative change we need.\"The Scottish Government declined to comment ahead of Thursdays statement."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Tories minimum wage shift shows politics is moving left","story":"And what better politician to apply the phrase to than Boris Johnson, accused of what has become known as ldquothigh-gate ndash that he placed his hand on a woman journalists leg  years ago. He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7329057.jpg?type=article-full","title":"abellio-says-move-end-scotrail-franchise-creates-staff-public-uncertainty","story":"Scottish Labour is to call to urge ministers on Wednesday not to extend the Abellio ScotRail contract beyond .Passengers have complained of delays, cancellations and overcrowding on the rail network.Ahead of the Opposition Day Debate, Abellio Scotrail has said it recognises the impact poor performance has on customersrsquo lives but said that any change would \"undermine the progress that has been made and be far more costly to the taxpayer\".Earlier this month, the Scottish Government put plans in place to run the railways as an \"operator of last resort\"ScotRails performance fails to improve.:Average of almost  trains a day cancelled byScotRailWhile the rail operator reports improvements, Scottish Labour insisted it was not enough - and has backed bringing the service back into public ownership.Dominic Booth, managing director of Abellio UK said: ldquoScotlandrsquos Railway needs stability and not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring about.ldquoWe have delivered more services, more seats, more jobs and more investment at less cost to the taxpayer.ldquoAbellio ScotRail has also invested an additional poundmillion to improve our performance and we are on track to deliver the Remedial Plan commitments made to Transport Scotland.ldquoScottish Labourrsquos motion threatens not only the long term vision for Scotlandrsquos Railway, it creates uncertainty for thousands of staff and  million passengers across all of our communities.ldquoAny change would be far more costly to the taxpayer and will fail to deliver the benefits of this once in a generation investment.:Labour forces vote on endingScotRaildeal  years earlyIn a briefing paper, Abellio said that the railway network was being used more than ever before, serving nearly  million passengers a year.Abellio said that since First ran the railways, there had been a % rise in services, % more seats, % more staff and that the taxpayer subsidy was % less.\"We have overcome the late delivery, by suppliers, of % of our new trains and kept customers moving during Network Rail failures on track and signalling, delays to Network Rail projects such as the  week Queen Street tunnel closure and major weather disruptions like the recent flooding,\" Abellio said.In March, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a remedial plan put into place by ScotRail was its \"last chance saloon\".Abellio said: \"We know the impact poor performance has on customersrsquo lives, and it is no surprise that there has been anger and frustration.

People were particularly fascinated, it seemed, in her arresting collection of jewelled insect brooches. Yet what has struck me is her advice on how a woman can reach the top of her profession.Lady Hale offered her hard-won guidance at the launch of a group called Cambridge Women in Law. A graduate of Girton College, she told those following in her footsteps that few females can reach the upper echelons of the male-dominated legal world entirely by their own efforts. For starters, they will be battling against an engrained masculine sense of entitlement that puts them at an immediate disadvantage. Even more signicant, however, is their domestic situation. ldquoProbably the most important thing when you are making your way as a woman in the law is to choose the right partner, she said, doubtless making some of her listeners delete their last text message demanding to know what time theyrsquod be home to make dinner.:Boris Johnson cant remember grope allegation eventTwice married, Hale was quick to note that her first husband as well as her second had been completely supportive. Despite all her intellectual and emotional capabilities, which in a perfect universe would catapult her and those like her to stardom whatever their personal circumstances, she was unequivocal. The choice of whether to have a le partner, and who that partner is, will prove vital to a womanrsquos advancement. Clearly, what holds for the law is equally true for other walks of le. Facebookrsquos chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote, ldquoI donrsquot know of one woman in a leadership position whose le partner is not fully ndash and I mean fully ndash supportive of her career.You need only think of Philip May, acting discreetly behind the arras as Theresa Mayrsquos unofficial consigliere to see this principle borne out. While the PM negotiated the most dficult job in Europe, grafting into the small hours, and on call night and day, he provided the psychological underpinning, or scaffolding, on which she stood. That ultimately her plans imploded does not diminish the fact that without his bolstering presence, his enabling faith in her ability to carry on, she would not have had the mental strength to persevere to the bitter end.Finding a partner who will be wholly encouraging isnrsquot easy. Too often the romantic knot has been tied long before the pressures of a womanrsquos career begin to escalate. If by then a couple have children, it takes deep pockets to pay for household help and childcare while two demanding vocations are conducted at full throttle, or an unusually far-sighted and self-abnegating companion prepared to put their own job, and ego, into cold storage for a few years.Such iniduals do exist, but finding him or her, while in the first flush of youth, takes greater maturity than most possess. Conversely, by the time a woman is older, wiser, and more established in her role, the biological clock can be ticking so loudly it drowns out common sense when getting hitched. Add to this the fact that women in all-consuming careers, such as medicine, law or the media, tend to get involved with those in equally full-on occupations, with similarly vaulting ambitions.:Boris Johnson to make final offer to EU on BrexitLady Halersquos comments will have struck a nerve with many working women. You can picture them, conducting a silent audit on their partners over the toast and marmalade, wonderingthey fall into the category of clinging ivy or storm-proof trellis. Yet the evidence of those who reach the top has been there all along, and what this high-flying judge says should come as no surprise.As far back as the s the brilliant mathematician Mary Somerville flourished because her second husband recognised her talent and gave her space to pursue her ideas. She still had to make sure the children were cared for, and was obliged to drop everything when guests unexpectedly called, but by the standards of the day her spousersquos attitudes were truly enlightened. Pierre Curie was another such enabler, while closer to our own times there has been no more devoted partner than Denis Thatcher or George Clooney, each treating his other halfrsquos ambitions with absolute seriousness.Weary of being an invisible launch-pad, some women like to quip: ldquoBehind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. Yet one of the questions Halersquos speech raises is whether or not men who aspire to be top dog are equally reliant on a partnerrsquos support. Could it be that, even in these more egalitarian times, women are more in need of a human coat of armour than men Like it or not, a high-powered position is not easy to sustain, whether yoursquore male or female. The toll on those at home is heavy. For true harmony, a household has room for only one stratospheric performer. Yet the back-up and moral support essential to someonersquos professional success is not the mundane business of stocking the fridge or doing the laundry, necessary though these are. Five-star house-keeping alone is not enough.If a partnership s like a Swiss watch, each cog performing its assigned role and never missing a beat, itrsquoll soon run into troublethere isnrsquot something more nourishing keeping it ticking. Surely itrsquos the deep emotional connection with a loved one, and the intellectual stimulation essential to a good relationship, that help a person achieve their best I will concede that most women probably need more overt confidence-boosting. Yet given the dearth of us at the pinnacle of whatever profession you care to name, itrsquos far too soon to know whether those who reach the uppermost rungs need more unconditional back-up from their partners than men. Personally, I canrsquot see why there would be much dference. For the moment, though, you could say that on this subject the jury is still out."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10490705.jpg?type=article-full","title":"twitter-tweetdeck-dms-impacted-service-outage","story":"Reports show a major outage across the globe with the social media giant investigating the issue.As part of the system outage, Tweetdeck and DMs were also down.Twitter confirmed: \"Weve been experiencing outages across Twitter and TweetDeck.

It was a unanimous decision by all  judges.We should pay tribute to the campaigners in England and those in Scotland, led by the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry MP, who brought these court actions.But Boris Johnsonrsquos week of disgrace didnrsquot end there.Dragged back to Parliament to explain himself, rather than apologise or show any contrition, he instead blamed everybody  - using some of the worst language I have ever heard spoken by any politician in the House of Commons.And when one MP pleaded with him to tone down his inflammatory language, reminding him of the appalling murder of MP Jo Cox just before the Brexit referendum, he described her comments as ldquohumbug.Politicians, especially in leadership roles, must strive to act respectfully in everything we do - whether that is on a national level in parliament and the media, online, or locally in our constituencies.And when that agenda of respect slips and behaviour is not of the standard expected of us we should not hesitate for one moment to condemn it.After his deplorable behaviour last week it has never been clearer that ndash in both his deeds and his words ndash Boris Johnson is not fit to be Prime Minister.He needs to be removed from power as soon as possible.:Brexit: Scottish Conservatives brought into line with UKAfter an Act of Parliament passed earlier this month, the Prime Minister is legally required to write to the EU seeking an extension to the Brexit deadline so we donrsquot crash out without a deal at the end of this month ndash with all the disastrous consequences that would entail.But Boris Johnson appears hell-bent on subverting the law ndash andhe will not send the letter, we need a Prime Minister who will.Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures ndash frankly, we are running out of time.Thatrsquos at the heart of the plan the SNP have been putting forward over the last few days.Our proposal relies on MPs from across the political spectrum working together for the good of all the nations of the UK.This technocratic government would only be in place for a few days ndash long enough simply to send the formal request to extend the Brexit deadline.It would then dissolve itself and make way for a general election, giving the people of the UK the opportunity to elect new MPs and decide how they want to proceed.However, there are plenty other potential candidates for caretaker Prime Minister, who might command the support of a majority of MPs for this short-lived government ndash so it absolutely does not need to be the Labour leader.But to repeat, we are running out of time ndash and any option that prevents a no-deal Brexit needs to be consideredMPs can get behind it.Once the threat of crashing out of the EU has been averted, I would absolutely relish a general election ndash the chance to put our case to the people.It would allow us to make the case once again to protect Scotlandrsquos place in Europe, and to give the people of Scotland the right to choose independence.Taking a step back from the seemingly endless Westminster mess, Scotland deserves better than this. We didnrsquot vote for any of it, and Brexit or not, we should not be subject to the whim of chaotic and dangerous Tory governments.No wonder more and more people are seeing independence as the best option for Scotlandrsquos future."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-key-questions-backstop-replacement-blueprint","story":"But reaching an agreement will be far from straightforward ndash and may yet prove impossible.ndash What are the issues which need to be resolved The problem remainsthe Northern Ireland backstop ndash the safety net intended to guarantee there is noof a hard border on the island of Ireland.Under the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by Theresa May,there is no long-term trade agreement in place that ensures an open border, the UK would remain closely tied to EU rules and its customs union.:Boris Johnsons new Brexit plan already dismissed as non-starter by DublinMr Johnson has insisted the measure has to be scrapped as being in a customs union would prevent the UK striking trade deals and his blueprint sets out in a legal text how he intends to achieve this.ndash What is Mr Johnsonrsquos alternative According to a briefing received by the Daily , the UK would remain closely tied to the EUrsquos rules during a transition period ending in  and then enter a free-trade agreement with the bloc.After that, in aplan that has been dubbed ldquotwo borders for four years Northern Ireland would be kept in a special status until , leaving the EU customs union alongside the rest of the UK, but remaining aligned on all single market rules for agriculture and industrial goods.If accurate and from this source thats likely the plan seems to consist of the worst parts of the backstop and no deal to ensure both North South and East West borders of some sort. https:t.co VBIHGtfkmdash David HenigOctober , This will create a regulatory border across the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media EyXnUe poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests EyXnUe.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Former justice secretary dismisses claim of foreign help behind Benn ActAt the end of the period theNorthern Ireland Assembly ndash which has been suspended since January  ndash will be free to choose whether toremain aligned to the EU in the future to protect north-south trade or follow British rules, which would probably have erged from Brussels over the period.ndash Will it work Irelandrsquos reaction to the plan was dismissive: deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said the reported blueprint was ldquono basis for an agreement and ldquoconcerning to say the least.Downing Street, meanwhile, blamed Dublin for the briefing to the , which does not bode well for a positive atmosphere in negotiations over the coming days.The European Union ndash which has repeatedly demanded ldquoconcrete and legally operational proposals from the UK for an alternative to the backstop ndash will respond once it has seen the formal text.ndash Any other reaction Former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain suggested the proposal would be in breach of the  European UnionAct and would ldquosabotage the Good Friday Agreement by creating a border with checks.Trade expert David Henig, from the European Centre For International Political Economy think tank,said the plan ldquoseems to consist of the worst parts of the backstop and no deal and ldquoIrsquom struggling to see any way this is acceptable to the EU or Northern Ireland.ndash Can a deal be done before October  Number  sources said the proposals would be a final offer andthe EU refused to engage then the UK would walk away from talks until after it has left the bloc.Mr Johnson said a deal would need to be largely completed by October , the day the agenda for the October  European Council summit of EU leaders is set.ldquoTen days should be enough, he told the Sun. ldquoIf therersquos a deal to be done, it could be done in that time.ndash Whatthere isnrsquot a deal Many of the same problems will present themselves ndash the UK will leave the customs union and single market, the measures which currently keep trade flowing freely.The border will therefore become the frontier between the European Union and a ldquothird country outside its rules.About % of trade in goods and merchandise between Britain and Ireland comes through Dublin Port, so we need to be ready for the possibility of a No Deal on Nov st.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is the show that is put on by graduating students, and is an opportunity for the public to see what art students have been up to. It has also traditionally been the time when the owners of galleries might call in to seethe next David Hockney might be lurking in the fresh crop of graduates.The friend who accompanied me to the Edinburgh show is himself an artist, a graduate of a Scottish art college. His technique is painstaking and his art extremely sensitive. He takes a long time to finish a painting, and will worry about the tiniest detail. I remember another Scottish painter, the much admired Jim Howie, who used to labour in a similar way on his gorgeous, luminescent abstracts, scraping off layer after layer of paint, to replace it, and then rework that new layer after a while. Gradually from this process there emerged paintings that glowed with light. His paintings haunt the walls they hang upon.: Hockney tears a strip off Hirst ahead of exhibitionFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereElizabeth Blackadder studied here\u2028So off we went to the Art College, that splendid building with its high windows intended to claim the northern light so beloved of artists. It is a building of rich artistic associations: here Robin Philipson was Principal in these echoing studios artists such as Elizabeth Blackadder, William Gillies and Anne Redpath all learned how to paint. It is now no longer an independent college, but has had the good fortune to become part of the University of Edinburgh, which has opened up a lot of possibilities for it.I have been going to the degree shows for a long time, although I have hardly been to any in the last ten years. The reason for this was that they began to depress me. On the grounds that one should be prepared to reconsider things, I thought I might take a fresh look.Resisting the temptation to look at the intriguing displays of textile work, we went straight to the painting studios. There was some painting on display, but there was also a lot of conceptual work – installations of folded paper, old chairs etc. That raises other issues, but on the painting to begin with... I looked at my artist friend. His disappointment was obvious. I wonderedhe was asking himself whether painting was only acceptableit was being done ironically. We moved from room to room. Nothing was said. In large part, the work on display failed to excite. There seemed to be a prevailing blandness about it and, what was particularly diappointing, not a great deal of evidence of skill in painting or drawing. Now, painting and drawing used to be the building blocks of artistic ability, and they were taught with rigour. David Hockney is an example of how a thorough training in drawing makes a great artist. Of course, it seems that there has been a strong reaction against tradition, and art colleges do not emphasise these skills as they did in the past – hence the dissident schools that have been set up to make up for the lack of interest in the art colleges.: Generation shows off Scots modern art’s ersity: Ones to watch in : Katie Paterson, artistArt students seeking private helpAnd that lack of interest is widespread: I know a highly regarded Scottish artist who told me he has had art students coming to him privately, asking him to teach them the skills that they were just not getting at college, where such things have been relegated or dropped. Nobody wants to downplay the efforts of our art colleges or the creative impulses of their students.There are many talented students at the colleges who will be served by supportive artist tutors. The problem is that the situation seems to be somewhat unbalanced, with so little room being given to the traditional skills of painting and drawing.Escape from the exhibition was achieved by dodging ious installations – ropes and the like which might otherwise detain the visitor. Installation art has its possibilities, and it could be argued that all art is conceptual. The problem is that much contemporary installation art occupies a very small – and often opaque – intellectual space, frequently fails to rise above the banal, and is often impenetrably personal. Such art will be forgotten, with the rare exception of the odd decaying shark, Marcel Duchamps’ pissoir that started it all, and perhaps the occasional unmade bed or pile of bricks. For the rest, it’s all been done.Still, though, there are in our midst artists of signicance – those who have something to say about the human predicament, those who expose us to beauty or profound emotion, those who make us look at the world with new eyes: they are still there, and their innate skill has asserted itself. The danger is that they will be condescended to, as is often the fate of those who question the prevailing artistic orthodoxy, which currently seems excessively focused on identity issues – on looking in rather than reaching out.Painters survive in spite of the fact that all the glittering prizes are reserved for conceptual art. Could the art colleges not encourage – or enable – their students to be these people  Perhaps the answer is that which applies in so many other contexts: back to the drawing board.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"an accountant s guide to scotland s future prosperity craig vickery","story":"After Brexit, Scotland will need to find new ways to attract skilled migrants, improve the skills of its own workforce, build the infrastructure a modern economy requires and make better political decisions, writes Craig Vickery.The aim of the annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandstatistics is to “enhance public understanding of fiscal issues”.Whoever is in office at Holyrood will decide the expenditure of the country. And what should unite our political parties is the need to enhance national income and taxation revenue, to train and attract skilled people and bring high income jobs to Scotland.Growing the economy and making Scotland an even more attractive place to live, work and study is the paramount goal of our policymakers.But there are challenges ahead, first of which is the current status of Brexit negotiations. Recent statistics also show that unemployment has risen, while the number of Scots in work has fallen. The job market of the future requires a erse and broad range of skills to be successful and to be relevant in a fast-moving world. Firstly, we know that skilled migration in particular is needed to continue the growth of our population, and our economy. Those coming from overseas to make Scotland their home tend to be younger, but we can do more to encourage people to stay for longer or settle in remoter rural and island areas. And we can do more to retain the local population too. Local economies and small businesses are particularly reliant on the accounting profession, which will be of vital importance in exports in the future and be part of the ingredients of success for tomorrow’s Scotland.Secondly, with the economy virtually at full employment, the question of how Scotland will retain and continue to attract talent post-Brexit, particularly in the financial, hospitality and agriculture sectors must be answered. We must also embrace the need to upskill and retrain people already in employment. : Scotland could prosperindependent, says Finance Secretary, as £. billion financial ‘black hole’ emergesFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereHere at accountancy body ACCA, we’re evolving our continuing professional development and mentoring programmes to help the accounting profession to adapt – recognising that the accountant of the future requires a erse and broad range of skills to be successful and to be relevant in a fast-moving world. Our career patterns and pathways are evolving – the certainties of a few years ago are replaced by organic and stimulating opportunities. Ensuring that we develop and maintain the relevant accountancy skills and knowledge is essential. Through our ‘accelerate’ internship programme we have helped students from Glasgow Caledonian University and the University of the West of Scotland secure internships and paid employment with local employers – including a former forklt driver and Greggs baker who made a career change after  years!We are also piloting a Scotland-wide apprenticeship programme with Robert Gordon University, enabling people to get a degree and qualy while in employment.The value of international studentsThe UK Government’s positive announcement last month on extending the visa stay of international students post-graduation is welcome, and a step towards recognising the tremendous value international students bring to our society, economy and universities.This move enhances the attractiveness of the UK, and Scotland, as a place to live, work and study – with our world-leading universities – as well as opening up routes into the highly skilled roles that enrich our local economies. The accountancy profession is committed to providing access to education so that anyone with the ability has the opportunity to become a finance professional – wherever they are from around the world.Lastly, our MSPs need to continue to examine how we can be even more connected – how business and government can work together to develop innovative solutions and build the infrastructure required to support a more modernised Scottish economy.: GERS report  Recap: All the political reaction: Scottish Independence: report warns austerity looming outside the UKWhether it is full-fibre broadband connectivity or renewable energy projects – Scotland must adapt to rapidly changing climates and demographics to deliver quality, strategically important infrastructure.Modernising the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail link or dualling the ‘spine of Scotland’ A road will be substantial steps towards securing Scotland’s economic and social development, and laying the very foundation on which our national well-being will be built.But it is a challenge to complete large projects on time and on budget. Clear decision-making, innovative funding mechanisms, proper monitoring and oversight are critical to providing taxpayer value for money.Offshore energy boomInnovation in public spending was the subject of a recent report from ACCA and Chartered Professional Accountants Canada, and it found a lack of political leadership was the single biggest barrier to meeting infrastructure needs. This absence leads to the prioritising of new projects over necessary maintenance. To mitigate this, the UK and Scottish governments should collect data on the potential of existing assets and the performance of previous projects.Next year Glasgow will be the proud host of the international climate change conference, COP. This will see Scotland taking centre stage and leading the global conversation on climate change.To combat the global tide of rising emissions and sea levels, Scotland has invested billions more into offshore energy – as Scottish renewable electricity reached record levels in the first quarter of , enough to power around  per cent of Scottish households for a year.Scotland’s renewable energy sector in particular continues to go from strength to strength. The billions of pounds of investment in offshore renewables in Scotland could create thousands of sustainable and skilled jobs.

This target is more ambitious than that set for the UK by some five years. In addition, an ambitious interim target of  per cent by  was also agreed.All this puts Scotland at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Encouragingly, there was a broad consensus across the Holyrood Chamber that this was the right thing to do, although, bizarrely, the Scottish Green Party MSPs abstained in the final vote, refusing to support the Bill which everyone  agreed to.The ambitious targets set last week don’t go far enough for some. I met a number of youth climate strikers outside Holyrood on Thursday, who were both articulate and passionate about their subject. Groups like Extinction Rebellion have certainly helped put tackling climate change at the centre of the political agenda, but on the fringes there is the whf of an end-of-times apocalyptic cult about some of their members.The measures that we are taking to reduce CO emissions are guided by the advice of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If their considered view on what needs to be done changes, then that is the time to take further action.: Why Holyrood must not betray Scotland’s climate strikers – Dr Richard DixonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereOffshore wind getting cheaperIt also needs to be remembered, in all this debate, that Scotland amounts for a fraction of one per cent of global CO emissions. Meeting our climate change targets will come at a cost, both economically and socially, but the overall impact will do nothing to help save our planet unless the lead we are taking is followed by countries across the world.The point was fairly made in last week’s debate that the setting of targets, however robust, is the easy part what is harder is actually implementing the policies to ensure these targets are met. In the fields of energy, and transport, in particular, we will all have to make dferent choiceswe are to meet the targets we have set.Technological advances will be vital here. Last month saw the award of the latest Contract for Dference by the UK Government, demonstrating another substantial reduction in the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind. Nuclear power, while now relatively more expensive in terms of its unit cost, provides a reliability that other, intermittent, forms of low-carbon electricity generation struggle to meet.In the area of transport, we need to see a modal sht away from petrol and diesel-powered vehicles both to public transport and to inidual vehicles powered by low-carbon sources. Electric cars are still limited in range due to battery size, but as the technology improves costs will reduce, and they will become more attractive.In all this, we do have to be aware of the potential impact of any policy changes on social justice. The fuel duty escalator introduced by the previous Labour Government has now been frozen for eight years running. While it is perfectly possible to make an argument in terms of reducing carbon emissions that the escalator is a valuable policy tool, in practice it is a regressive tax that hits hardest on the poorest households.: Brexit and climate change leave farmers struggling – Alan White:  terrying ways climate change could affect your le in ScotlandUnfair taxes dressed up as ‘green’ policiesIn similar fashion, the SNP’s Workplace Parking Levy or “Car Park Tax”, which could hit those parking at their place of work with an annual charge of up to £, might well be dressed up as a “green” policy, but will hit hard at those who have no alternative but to use their private cars to get to their pace of work.Similarly, low-emission zones in city centres can be got around by those wealthy enough to buy more modern, low-emitting vehicles, but those who can only afford to buy a ten-year-old diesel car will find themselves effectively excluded from city centres. Raising the cost of aviation will mean that the wealthy can still travel by air, while pricing out those who simply want an annual family holiday to the Mediterranean.All this demonstrates why government policies are a blunt instrument which can often have unintended and negative consequences. And it illustrates why inidual responsibility, and personal choices, are as important in the fight against climate change as any legislation that might be passed.Because,we are serious about reducing CO, we will all need to be prepared to live our lives dferently. That means making choices that come at personal cost to ourselves: using the car less, flying less often, turning down the heating, and wasting less food.To give just one example: people will often make the claim thatonly public transport were better, they would make less use of their cars. And yes, public transport can and should be better, but the reality is that evenwe had the world’s best public transport in Scotland, it is still never as convenient as using your own vehicle. The best bus or train system in the world will not pick you up from your front door, and deliver you precisely to your exact destination, by your own preferred route. Using public transport as an alternative to a private car will always mean a sacrice, and it is simply a cop-out to say that we need better public transport before we can make that choice.We don’t need to be Greta Thunberg to realise that we need to take the threat of climate change much more seriously than we have done in the past. The Scottish Parliament has taken a signicant step forward with the legislation passed last week, but on its own it simply won’t be enough. We are all going to have to change our behaviours, and that is going to come at personal cost.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"alister jack scot tories have been brought into line over no deal brexit","story":"The Scottish Conservatives have been #brought into line# with the UK party following interim leader Jackson Carlaw#s endorsement of a no-deal Brexit, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has said.Mr Carlaw abandoned former leader Ruth Davidson’s opposition to a no-deal Brexit on Sunday, saying the Scottish Tories would back Boris Johnson to take the UK out of the EU on  October.: Boris Johnson warns Brexit delay will trigger  chaos and indyref: Article  supersedes Benn Act on Brexit extension, says Jacob Rees-MoggThere were reports Mr Carlaw’s shadow cabinet were left in a “cold fury” over not being consulted, but Mr Jack claimed MSPs had been told about the move, as had Ms Davidson.“He’s bringing the Scottish Conservatives into line with the rest of the UK party,” Mr Jack told STV.In his first conference speech since taking over as Scottish Secretary, Mr Jack will announce plans for a £ million ‘growth deal’ for Argyll and Bute.It is the next step in a £. billion programme that aims to reassert the UK government’s role in Scotland and create thousands of jobs over the next  years.

It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm.

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

The PSNI - along with other police forces across the UK - embarked yesterday on a month-long operation to seize uninsured vehicles.During last years operation, the PSNI seized  vehicles during October and are hoping to achieve similar results this month.Meanwhile, Operation Drive Insured, developed between the MIB and the National Police Chiefs Councils National Roads Policing Intelligence forum , will aim for increased enforcement activity to help improve road safety and raise public awareness of the issue.The campaign follows climbing collision rates caused by drivers without valid insurance.Uninsured drivers also cause a disproportionately high level of fatalities with over  people killed by an uninsured or untraced hit and run driver in the UK each year, according to MIB figures.PSNI Inspector Rosemary Leech explained that during last years operation the force embarked on a sustained social media campaign to accompany their enforcement actions.\"The PSNI recognise there is a well proven link between uninsured vehicles and other forms of criminality,\" said Inspector Leech. \"Thats why this year weve already seized over , vehicles, thereby denying uninsured drivers the means to perpetuate this offence and prevent other illegal behaviour. \"Removing such vehicles reduces the risk to communities and helps us to keep people safe on our roads.\"She added that last years PSNI social media campaign prompted the MIB to comment that their coverage on #opdriveinsured was leading the way nationally with more coverage than ever thought possible.\"The PSNI have access to the industry database of uninsured vehicles which alerts us to the presence of such vehicles, thereby allowing us to focus in on this offending,\" added Inspector Leech. \"The driver will be offered a roadside fixed penalty of £ plus six penalty points as an alternative to court, plus the release fee of £ once they have proved their vehicle is now insured.\"According to MIB, the economic impact of collisions caused by uninsured hit-and-run drivers is considerable.UK-wide government figures for the average value of prevention of road traffic injuries compared against MIBs recorded rates indicate an annual economic cost of over £.bn.This includes costs for emergency services, medical care, loss of productivity and property damage.The economic impact of uninsured driving to the insurance industry comes to around £m each year which is ultimately funded by those motorists who pay insurance premiums.Anna Fleming, chief operating officer of MIB, said the organisation will continue to campaign to reduce the numbers of uninsured drivers. \"Having valid motor insurance is more than a legal requirement, it is designed to protect victims of road traffic collisions by providing them with financial compensation,\" she said.\"We will continue our long standing partnership with UK police to ensure that everyone on the roads has insurance and to make uninsured driving socially unacceptable.\""},{"url":null,"title":"queens university regrets past use of gay aversion therapy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

David started working as an apprentice electrical engineer at the firm last September and now faces the prospect of being kicked off his Northern Regional College course.\"I need to find a placement within four weeks,\" he explained.\"There seems to be a couple of openings, but evenI do get something Im not sure it will be sorted within a month.\" Both men praised Mid and East Antrim Council which rallied more than  employers with , vacancies to the jobs fair. Over  jobseekers arrived at the venue within  minutes of the doors opening - with some companies interviewing applicants on the spot. Davids dad, who worked as a production operator at the failed firm for eight years, still left with concerns.\"He doesnt drive - so hes limited as to where he can accept work,\" Mr Millar said.The married father-of-four and former joiner is also worried about his own career prospects, but expressed relief that he made his final mortgage payment just a few months ago. \"I left the construction industry when it went bad, but Ill probably try and move back into it now, but who knows what will happen. \"My we works part-time and weve no mortgage payments now.\"Ex-production manager William Neillleft feeling optimistic. \"There are plenty of jobs here,\" he said. \"I might not get something doing exactly what I was doing or with the same salary, Ill just have to take whats going.\" One elderly man who was at the job fair to support his son was less optimistic. \"My son has five kids, including a newborn who just arrived three weeks ago,\" he said. \"His we has just started maternity leave.\"The pensioner said his son, who has worked at the firm for  years, is trying to remain hopeful. \"He started when he was  and just out of school,\" he added.\"Its heartbreaking - I could break down and cry, but what good would that go \"This is a great response from local employers and hopefully some good comes from it.\" One newly unemployed family man who has just paid his mortgage payment for this month admitted he has no idea where the money for next months payment is coming from as he left with a handful of application forms. Married father-of-two Timothy Reidwas browsing the dozens of employer stands with his one-year-old daughter Halle. The spray painter has spent six years at Wrightbus, but as some of that time was through an agency he is only entitled to three years redundancy payments. \"I got a contract in October  which means I miss out on an extra year of redundancy by one month.\"Mr Reid, whose we works part-time, is worried about future mortgage payments. He expressed concern for the mental health of his former colleagues and questionedspecial welfare provisions will be put in place for those under pressure. He also made a desperate plea for potential buyers to look to take a good look at the hundreds of protesters who gathered outside Green Pastures Church on Sunday. \"Thats wasnt just a protest, it was a loyal workforce standing in solidarity,\" he said.\"It was men and women who brought their own tools to finish the job when things became grim inside the company. \"The same respect they show to William Wright is hard to find but it can be earned by a new buyer who treats them right.\"Married father-of-two Phil McIlvennahas been with Wrightbus since he left school over  years ago.The coach builder, who started as an apprentice, has spent the last week wondering what hes going to do. \"The longer you sit and dwell on this it gets harder to lt your head but today has given me hope,\" he said. \"I didnt know there were so many jobs out there and that I can transfer my skills.\"Mr McIlvenna praised the Department for Communities and the local council, which has also ensured people have information about CV design and retraining opportunities. Ashley Henderson , who worked in the customer care department until last week, is quietly optimistic about the future. \"We are all devastated - we were like one big family and now we are here competing for the same jobs,\" she said. \"But going by today there seems to be plenty out there.\"However, the newlywed, who recently carried out major renovations on a recently purchased home, is worried about finance commitments. A council spokesperson welcomed the huge response from dozens of companies including those who were unable to get into the venue and confirmed it is considering hosting a similar event next week.

I think someone deliberately went with an out of date paper in order to damage the prospects of getting an agreement.\"They may see the movement away from the previous mantra that the withdrawal agreement is not open to renegotiation, and be aiming to prevent that.\"Mr Dodds said his party was continuing to work with Downing Street to find a solution with the EU and would redouble its efforts to \"stop the derailers\" from succeeding.Secretary of State Julian Smith said: \"I dont know where these papers have come from, Ive not seen them, I dont know whos written them, but Im clear that we cant have customs facilities in the places mentioned in the reports.\"Five or  miles from the border is still an issue and I am clear on that, and the Government is clear, that the Good Friday Agreement needs to be respected,\" he told the BBC.SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said that the proposal for custom clearance zones was \"unworkable and unacceptable\" for border towns and communities.\"We do not want any hardening of the border and we do not want any customs checks anywhere near us,\" he said.\"The British Government promised multiple times that they will not erect a border in Ireland. \"These very plans do just that. It doesnt matter whether checks take place on the border or  miles from it, it is still a hardening of the border.\"Mr McCrossan added: \"Despite Boris now backtracking on this leak, its clear this Tory Government havent a clue what they are doing. They have been reckless and have been playing with peoples lives and livelihoods. \"Its time the British Government stopped giving into the DUP and got back to the table with proposals that actually facilitate the status quo rather than policies of ision.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: \"Boris Johnsons latest position doesnt provide any reassurance. \"In contrast to Theresa May, he has moved away from the backstop, which would avoid any customs interface to the island, to instead how to manage dferent customs zones. \"This situation is fundamentally at odds with Good Friday Agreement and the all-island economy. Even checks away from the border will create burdens for businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises and would create signicant opportunities for smuggling.\"Prime Minister’s hurdles to clear ahead of BrexitPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will table the Government’s formal proposals for a new Brexit deal with Brussels in the coming days. What are the issues which need to be resolved  Inevitably, it comes down to the backstop. Under the withdrawal agreement,at the end of the transition period after Britain leaves the EU there is no long-term trade agreement with Brussels in place, the UK would effectively remain part of the EU customs union while negotiations continue. But Mr Johnson says this is unacceptable as it could potentially leave Britain tied to EU customs arrangements indefinitely. It would also mean the UK would remain subject to EU regulations over which it would have no say. What is the PM’s alternative  One part of the package is for an all-Ireland regime for agri-food products, avoiding the need for checks at the border. At the same time, Mr Johnson is adamant that the UK, including Northern Ireland, is leaving the customs union, so the second part would involve “de-dramatising” controls for other goods. How would they do that  RTE reported that UK officials have suggested the checks could be carried out at a series of “customs clearance centres” between five and  miles back from the border on either side. Mr Johnson has insisted that is not the UK plan, but has yet to say what he is proposing. What happensthe UK and EU cannot get a deal  Under the Benn Act,there is no deal by October  the PM is required to ask Brussels for a further extension to Britain’s withdrawal date. While Mr Johnson has said that he will abide by the law, he has also been adamant that Britain is leaving on October  come what may. How, in the absence of a deal, he could meet both commitments he has yet to explain."},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures the highlights from harry and meghans africa tour","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: DCSDC Health and Community Committee and UNISON Community Branch Activists."},{"url":null,"title":"newtown volunteers working around clock look kittens","story":"There are more kittens to be adopted in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection is looking for people to adopt kittens.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensMore kittens are in need of adoption in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensOne of the kittens up for adoption Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection staff are hoping to see more kittens adopted.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensCats protection logo.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown youngsters strike climate change","story":"Climate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Pictured left to right, Kylie DaviesSophie WeaverRuby White, Lyssie Jarvisalt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"unique mix entertainment offer bishops castles michaelmas fair","story":"Barrel organ player, Dave Hill entertains crowds at this year#s Michaelmas Fltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtair.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class. In ,  children attended the school.The writing on the wall came when a proposed merger with nearby Annsborough Integrated Primary School to create a controlled integrated school was abandoned in the face of falling pupil numbers.In May the Education Authority issued a document in which it stated that Castlewellan Primary would close and Annsborough Integrated would be retained.The document said numbers at Castlewellan Primary had declined ldquoto a point where the potential establishment of a controlled integrated primary school was no longer viable.The closure will mark the end of controlled education in the town. Castlewellan High School closed in  when it merged with Killyleagh and Quoile high schools to form Down Academy mdash now Blackwater integrated College mdash in Downpatrick.Mr McLean said staff would continue to give pupils ldquothe best possible education until the school closes its doors for the final time.ldquoI have been here for  years.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town.

It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

I had my outgoings, like everybody , and in an instant my income was just stopped dead..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button ‘‘I had to sell my house in Belfast and move back to my parents after I was made redundant as I couldn’t afford to pay the mortgage.This was very tough on them and me both.’’But, with a positive outlook on le, Trevor said he knew there was something  for him out there. ‘‘I know that is not the case for everybody, but my feeling was, these things happen for a reason, even though it wasn’t immediately apparent at the time. ‘‘I just knew there was something I could do. My gut feeling was that it was the start of something, rather than the end.’’That start, was Trevor’s decision to set up an embroidery business.‘‘I bought an embroidery machine about  years ago as a bit of a hobby. ‘‘It sat in the bedroom for eight or nine years and it was never turned on, except maybe to do a bit for a friend.‘‘So when the company I worked for went bust I looked at it and wonderedI could make it into a business.’’Trevor followed his instincts and decided to give it a go, running the business, Sewpro, initially, from his parents’ spare room.Celebrations as Peterboroughs Ideal Shopping Direct s to profit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"‘‘It’s all I could do, I couldn’t afford to rent somewhere, like a business unit. So I just worked from home and squeezed a lot of my friends for work, basically anything I was a member of, like the Boy’s Brigade and the motorbike club I was in - they would put a bit of work my waythey were doing an event. ‘‘I said I would give it six months, and then after that I thought I’ll give it a year, then I decided to give it two years... I’m still here now, there’s no turning back.’’Although Trevor’s business is going well now, he admits the first few years were tough. ‘‘For the first three years after starting the business it was really hard keeping my head above water. ‘‘I’ll not lie, I don’t know how many times I could have called it quits and declared myself bankrupt, but I managed to muddle through.‘‘But I really enjoyed what I was doing, so I think that made the dference. ‘‘Anything I did get, I just put back into the business - I bought a decent computer or whatever I needed for the business. ‘‘I kept my head above water, then after three years I bought a second machine and I thought it was time to think seriously about making it into a proper business, rather than a bedroom hobby - it didn’t look too professional when folk have to come to your house to sort out clothing.’’Seven years ago Trevor approached the Ballymena Business Centre and took a unit.Ballymena Business Centre is a charity committed to promoting enterprise and entrepreneurship in the greater Ballymena area of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. They offer advice, workshops and support for business start-ups. Trevor said: ‘‘They offer courses andthere is ever any business loans they’ll always flag them up to you in case you are wanting to try and expand or looking for new machinery. ‘‘Sometimes there are grants that come around and they are great with helping you go through the paperwork for that.’’ Trevor now has one part-time employee and the firm specialises in providing quality embroidered school wear, workwear, sports wear as well as promotional products for iniduals, groups   organisations and corporate customers.And business is going well. ‘‘It can take a long time to get new customers on board, but usually once they are on board we can keep them OK.’’As someone who has experience of redundancy, Trevor can empathise with Wrightbus and Thomas Cook employees, but he believes that with the right attitude you can turn a seemingly hopeless situation into a positive. ‘‘Even though it seems like it’s the end of the world when these things happen, there are definitely opportunities out there. ‘‘It is more about your attitude to what has happened, than what has actually happened. ‘‘You can’t change what’s been done and no matter how much bad feeling you have towards where you were before, you just have to put that to the side and keep on plugging on. ‘‘There are jobs out there andyou are willing to go and look for them and you are willing to do a day’s work, you’ll get something. I know that makes it sound very simple, I know it’s not, it wasn’t easy for me for three years.’’He added: ‘‘I also learned during the first three years after the redundancy how little I really needed to get by on and what the essentials were rather than wasting money as I would have done before.‘‘It toughens you up a bit and you realise you are just going to have to graft. ‘‘There will be no shortcuts there’s no way theywill walk into an equivalent job for the same money now that they are used to, so you are going to have to cut your cloth accordingly, which is doable - everybody can do that, it’s only a temporary thing. ‘‘It might take you two or three years to find your feet again, but it’ll come.’’try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid to young N.I. woman who died suddenlyIts official -

a period of  days.However, the Northern Ireland Officehas confirmed during that time she spent just  nights in Northern Ireland.Responding to a Freedom of Information request, the NIO said:“According to our records, Karen Bradley spent  nights in Northern Ireland while Secretary of State.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button By contrast, it is understood that Mrs Bradley’s successor in the role, Julian Smith, has spent about half of the working week in Northern Ireland since his appointment in July.In March, Mrs Bradley responded to criticism of how little time she was spending in Northern Ireland by saying that she tried to spend one day a week in the Province.She argued that the number of tight Commons votes - a consequence of a hung parliament - meant that she needed to be in Westminster more than her predecessors.However, while on some occasions Mrs Bradley was required to be in London for votes, she found time for other pursuits.While secretary of state, she personally accepted more than £, in gts, including corporate FA Cup Final tickets, tickets to a music festival, high-end Formula  tickets, Alton Towers tickets and Premiership tickets with hospitality.Last week the Institute for Government proposed a solution to the problem of the secretary of state having to stay in London for long periods due to parliamentary business.The think tank said: “It is also important that the proposed secretary of state should be able to spend a signicant amount of time in Northern Ireland – however tight the parliamentary arithmetic and demands in Westminster may be.“The two major UK parties should agree automatic pairing for the NI secretary to allow that to happen.”Pairing is the Commons system wherebyan MP cannot attend the chamber for serious reasons - such as a bereavement or serious medical condition - the whips agree on a cross-party basis that someone from the other side will not vote, so as to neutralise the effect of their absence.IRA ‘realised it had so many informers it couldn’t kill them all’Boris Johnson gets hero’s welcome at DUP reception, shortly before his Brexit plan for Northern Ireland is reported Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The report also implicitly criticised the calibre of some recent secretaries of state.It said: “The Northern Ireland secretary is an important job in the UK government – but prime ministers do not always treat it as such.“Prime ministers should consider carefully who they make their Northern Ireland Secretary.“It should be regarded as a role for asenior secretary of state who is able to command respect across the political and civil society spectrum in Northern Ireland, and able to fairly represent their views back in London.“Appointments must be made with regard for the interests of Northern Ireland, not just who the Prime Minster needs to accommodate in Cabinet.”try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid to young N.I. woman who died suddenlyWright family deny claims that Wrightbus bidders were put off after being asked too much money to lease the propertyIts official -

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal.

This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.
