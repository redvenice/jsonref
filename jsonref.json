But he vows to reduce inequality, improve pay and welfare spending and run a tight budget.Lopez Obrador was by no means the only candidate to lambaste Trump, with all three contenders signaling their opposition to the US president.But his rivals warned that a victory by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy.             The leftist presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casts his ballot on Sunday in Mexico City          Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves after voting as part of the Mexico 2018 Presidential Election on Sunday.

It is a relatively new occurrence and it is something we are watching closely.\u0027In 2017 there were 22 captive lions poached on farms where lions are used to being fed. They are vulnerable and it\u0027s an easy way to get your hands on lion parts\u0027.It is feared that lion bones are also being used to replace the far rarer tiger bones in South East Asia and are being smuggled out for use in traditional medicines.A complete lion skeleton can be bought in South Africa for £1000 but in Vietnam it is worth £50,000 and the inidual claws and teeth of the lion are highly prized.In April lion park owner Gert Claasens, 48, had three of his lions butchered for heads and claws and three stolen to be butchered later in Petrus Steyn in the Free State.The following month Justin Fernandes, 32, had 3 lions and a rare golden tabby tiger killed by poachers at the Jugomaro Predator Park in Limpopo for their body parts.Christa, 55, who has a 1000 acre animal park which has 53 tigers and 10 lions along with 350 monkey and birds said:\u0027We are trying to conserve and save animals.\u0027But then these people come along and do these terrible things to them\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/11/4DB9370100000578-5908495-Donald_Trump_right_and_Kim_Jong_un_reached_an_agreement_on_denuc-a-1_1530528677683.jpg","title":"US plan dismantle North Korea nuclear program year","story":"    U.S. National security adviser John Bolton said the process could be nearly completed \u0027within a year\u0027          Donald Trump (right) and Kim Jong-un reached an agreement on denuclearization in Singapore last monthFollow-up talks are scheduled to take place imminently between US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and North Korean officials following a successful meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last month. The Financial Times reported that Pompeo was due to visit North Korea this week but the State Department has not confirmed any travel plans. Some experts disputed Bolton\u0027s optimistic time frame for decommissioning the North\u0027s weapons.\u0027It would be physically possible to dismantle the bulk of North Korea\u0027s programs within a year,\u0027 said Thomas Countryman, the State Department\u0027s top arms control officer under President Barack Obama.\u0027I do not believe it would be possible to verify full dismantlement within a year, nor have I yet seen evidence of a firm DPRK decision to undertake full dismantlement.\u0027Last week, 38 North, a website run by the Johns Hopkins University, said satellite imagery showed the North had been upgrading its Yongbyon nuclear complex.Michael Cohen tells ABC his family and the country now have...Comedian who hoaxed Trump with a prank call hires Stormy...Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wins the Mexican...Share this article    A satellite image published last week shows what is claimed to be ongoing uranium enrichment at a North Korean nuclear facility on June 21\u0027None of this activity technically violates any agreement Kim may have made,\u0027 said Vipin Narang, an associate professor at MIT\u0027s security studies Programme.\u0027What it suggests is that Kim has no intention of surrendering his nuclear weapons.\u0027Kim agreed at the June 12 summit to \u0027work toward denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,\u0027 but the joint statement released after the meeting gave no details on how or when Pyongyang might forsake its nuclear and missile programmes.Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist and Stanford University professor, has predicted it would take around 10 years to dismantle and clean up a substantial part of North Korea\u0027s Yongbyon nuclear site.Bolton refused to comment on intelligence matters but the United States was going into nuclear negotiations aware of Pyongyang\u0027s failure to live up to its promises in the past.\u0027There\u0027s not any starry-eyed feeling among the group doing this,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027re well aware of what the North Koreans have done in the past.\u0027           US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to meet North Korean officials imminently to discuss how the process will take place"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/22/05/4D82579100000578-0-image-a-8_1529641792469.jpg","title":"Woman bought lettuce gets shock finds frog lurking leaves","story":"    A green frog is seen in the British round lettuce, which was brought from an Aldi shop in RedruthIn March, the shopper said she also found a stone in her chunky beef soup from Aldi.Mrs Tolputt has praised the shop for its handling of the situation and that she can see the \u0027funny side of it\u0027. The 37-year-old shared a video showing the frog sat on top of the lettuce on social media. She added: \u0027I saw something move and there was a little pair of eyes looking back at me.

AMLO was then a member of the PRI party, led by President Enrique Pena Nieto, but quit in the late 1980s.After losing the Tabasco governor’s race twice, he staged protests in an attempt to raise his profile during a time in which there was increasing resistance towards the leading party. However, in 2000, AMLO was elected as the mayor of Mexico City as part of the PRD.With his first bid at the presidency in 2006, he promised to ‘put the poor first’, but his critics branded him ‘a danger for Mexico’, likening him to Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez. The election was decided by a thin margin and López Obrador claimed it had been rigged.          Mexico City\u0027s main square, the Zocalo, as Andrés Manuel López Obrador delivers his speechAMLO led protests yet again and declared that he was the legitimate president of Mexico. This led to the former Mayor speaking in villages that had not been visited by political leaders for years.One of his aides, Polimnia Romana Sierra said: ‘He spoke with the same energy under a tree in front of 10 people as he did in the full Zocalo. Nobody works the microphone like him.’He formed a new party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and by 2015, he was regarded as the next election winner. In addition to this, as the PRI became increasingly involved in corruption scandals, López Obrador also grew in popularity.His wife and fervent feminist, Beatriz Gutierrez, also helped to extend his appeal to female voters in Mexico.          AMLO, accompanied by wife Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, delivers his victory speech in MexicoAndrés Manuel López Obrador\u0027s policiesAfter winning the Mexican election, Andrés Manuel López Obrador must now ensure that his promises are fulfilled. Despite critics comparing AMLO to Hugo Chavez and his leftist sympathies could turn Mexico into Venezuela, he took home a landslide victory.According to the BBC, many believe that he shares an authoritarian approach and will ruin the economy, but AMLO has rejected these claims and has said that he will not carry out expropriations and will not seek re-election.However, he has promised to renew contracts awarded by the state oil company Pemex to private companies during the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto and will check they are not corrupt. He has also vowed to bring economic growth, jobs and social development programmes.‘We will carry out a peaceful transformation, ordered, but profound and even radical, because the word radical comes from root, and what we will do... is, in essence, to root out the corrupt regime,’ he said at one campaign rally.Against what he describes as the ‘power mafia’ of Mexico, he plans to increase scholarships for the young and expand welfare for the elderly, offering ‘good relations’ with the private sector and accusing business leaders of acting ‘like they owned Mexico’.AMLO has also promised to bring peace to the war on drugs, but will not continue the military-led strategy. Notably, he has also said that he would not let Mexico bow down to Trump and asked for ‘friendship’ and ‘mutual respect’ to avoid any trade war.\u0027Soon, very soon, after the victory of our movement, we will defend migrants all over the American continent and the migrants of the world who, by necessity, must abandon their towns to find life in the United States it\u0027s a human right we will defend,\u0027 Lopez Obrador said in a June speech reported by El Universal.US President Donald Trump congratulated Lopez Obrador in a tweet saying: \u0027Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico.

ally","story":"    Theresa May told MPs today (pictured) that Britain had the largest defence budget in Europe and the second largest among Nato members           Donald Trump (pictured at the White House with First Lady Melania yesterday) is expected to heap pressure on NATO members to spend more at what could be a bad-tempered summit next week          In a letter to his British counterpart, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis (pictured) suggested the UK might not continue to be a \u0027global actor\u0027 unless funding was increased           Just six NATO countries meet the 2 per cent of GDP target for spending on their military forcesDonald Trump is expected to heap pressure on NATO members to spend more at what could be a bad-tempered summit next week.  In the missive, seen by The Sun, General Mattis told Mr Williamson that Washington is \u0027concerned\u0027 the UK\u0027s forces and diplomatic influence are \u0027at risk of erosion\u0027.He said he wanted Britain to remain America\u0027s \u0027partner of choice\u0027 - but added that the French were committed to being \u0027global actors\u0027 alongside the US. Mr Trump will travel to Europe next week for a potentially stormy NATO gathering on July 11-12, before heading to the UK.In the two-page letter, Gen Mattis said \u0027the credibility of the UK\u0027s armed forces\u0027 had been crucial in securing its place on the world stage.David Cameron DID ask Barack Obama to warn that Brexit would...Tory Brexit war catches fire as minister demands \u0027insolent\u0027...Share this articleBut he added: \u0027I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change.\u0027The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money.Gen Mattis said: \u0027A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.\u0027Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.\u0027Highlighting Mr Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra £260billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: \u0027As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence.\u0027Other allies are following suit.\u0027          The letter has been leaked as Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured left with Mrs May and her husband Philip at an Armed Forces Day event over the weekend) lobbies hard for his budget to be expanded    Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron (pictured together at the White House in April) have struck up a close rapportHe stressed that it was \u0027in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice\u0027 but \u0027in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability\u0027.In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: \u0027It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.\u0027Downing Street tried to play down the row, insisting Britain has the \u0027biggest defence budget in Europe and the second biggest in Nato\u0027.‘I would point to the Nato Secretary General following his meeting with the PM where he said he appreciates Britain’s commitment and leadership in the Alliance,\u0027 the PM\u0027s spokesman said.‘The UK is above the 2 per cent contribution and we have said we will continue to meet that target.‘We, the US and France are close allies and partners willing to take action together in defence of our values.’However, the spokesman refused to state that the UK would continue to have the largest defence budget in Europe.   The week after receiving the letter, Mr Williamson told MPs that US patience over European defence spending was wearing thin.\u0027We can\u0027t continue to expect US taxpayers to keep picking up the tab for European defence indefinitely, nor can we expect US patience to last forever,\u0027 he said on June 20.The Commons Defence Committee has also called for a significant funding boost, moving the level of defence spending up from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of total GDP.A cash injection on this scale would equate to additional funding of around £20billion a year and bring investment in defence to levels similar to those seen between the end of the Cold War and the mid-1990s."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/13/4DD6ABFA00000578-5909173-The_27_year_old_princess_a_relative_of_Emperor_Akihito_will_marr-m-3_1530533285778.jpg","title":"Pictured

A satellite image shows what 38 North says is ongoing uranium enrichment at a North Korean nuclear facility on June 21  One official said: ‘There’s no evidence they are decreasing stockpiles, or that they have stopped their production.’ Another added: ‘There is absolutely unequivocal evidence that they are trying to deceive the US.’ Some experts disputed Bolton\u0027s optimistic time frame for decommissioning the North\u0027s weapons.\u0027It would be physically possible to dismantle the bulk of North Korea\u0027s programs within a year,\u0027 said Thomas Countryman, the State Department\u0027s top arms control officer under President Barack Obama.\u0027I do not believe it would be possible to verify full dismantlement within a year, nor have I yet seen evidence of a firm DPRK decision to undertake full dismantlement.\u0027 Experts at the American website 38 North, which monitors North Korea, published satellite images showing that the Yongbyon nuclear site was expanding at a ‘rapid pace’, with evidence of activity at the cooling units and of vehicles transporting materials.Trump has suspended military exercises in the Korean peninsula after North Korea stopped carrying out missile and nuclear tests.Kim had signed a joint statement at the Singapore summit last month in which he promised to ‘work toward denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula’.          The claim makes a nonsense of Donald Trump’s statement last month, shortly after his summit with dictator Kim Jong Un, that ‘there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea’Just last week, Trump said that North Korea was destroying four of its nuclear test sites and that the process of ‘total denuclearisation... has already started’. However, more than a dozen of Trump’s own spies have broken rank to warn the President was being ‘deceived’ by Kim as the regime quietly increased production in recent months while conducting diplomatic talks.Washington sources said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will fly to Pyongyang on Friday for talks with Kim’s top aides on the denuclearisation plan.The discussions will address CIA reports that North Korea has increased its production of nuclear weapons fuel, according to a US Congressional source.One official told NBC: ‘There are lots of things that we know that North Korea has tried to hide from us for a long time.’MP Mark Pritchard, a member of All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, said: ‘The Americans will not be taken for fools. North Korea must keep its commitments, which should all be verifiable, before any sanctions are lifted.’The White House declined to comment on the claims.Additional reporting: William LowtherNorth Korea satellite images show missile plant construction, analysts say - CNN"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/02/13/4DD5FA1900000578-0-image-a-29_1530533174999.jpg","title":"Viewers say GOD walking sky storm footage","story":"The amazing footage was caught on camera by Solo Dolo on her Facebook Live\u0027I regret calling her a Qatar w****\u0027: Daughter of former Sky...Share this articleThe camera then focuses on the bright white patch on the horizon and adds: \u0027Look at that hole right in the sky... that\u0027s who\u0027s got the power.\u0027A short while later, the voice recording the video says: \u0027He got us covered at least, we\u0027re alright.\u0027  Yet it was not until uploading the video where a friend pointed out the strange shape which resembled a human body in the clouds, which some people are claiming to be God.Viewers were quick to point out a shadowy figure which looks like it has arms and legs walking between the bright patch in the clouds.

And rather than the use of force to fight spiraling violence, he will look to fix root causes such as inequality and poverty.\u0027Peace and tranquility are the fruits of justice,\u0027 Lopez Obrador said.

The National Electoral Institute said 98,854 of them mailed ballots by Saturday, more than twice the amount of Mexicans abroad that voted in the last election. Josefina Serrano, 44, who rode eight hours to Tijuana from Sacramento on a bus organized for voters, said she voted for Lopez Obrador because she was tired of corruption and violence in Mexico, as well an anti-Mexican attitude in the United States.\u0027I came because I want things to change, and to shut up even President Trump,\u0027 she said. \u0027Living in the United States, you\u0027re called out for being Mexican - not just by Trump, but by everyone. They think we\u0027re all corrupt.\u0027 The runner-up in the 2006 and 2012 presidential elections, Lopez Obrador pitched himself as the only one capable of cleaning up the government after years of poor economic growth and rampant gang violence eroded faith in the political class.Seeking support from economic nationalists, leftist liberals and social conservatives, Lopez Obrador has been vague on policy details. But he vows to reduce inequality, improve pay and welfare spending and run a tight budget.Lopez Obrador was by no means the only candidate to lambaste Trump, with all three contenders signaling their opposition to the US president.But his rivals warned that a victory by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy.             The leftist presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casts his ballot on Sunday in Mexico City          Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves after voting as part of the Mexico 2018 Presidential Election on Sunday.

This Wednesday, in the much anticipated 50th issue of Batman, the DC Universe’s most eligible bachelor is due to tie the knot with his longtime arch-enemy Catwoman.Except, er, we already know how it goes. The wedding of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle has been two years in the making, a storyline that has been building in fortnightly issues ever since the flagship Batman title was taken over by writer Tom King in 2016. However – and please insert your own Robin-punching-his-palm “Holy matrimony!” gag here – comics fans eagerly awaiting the landmark issue were shocked at the weekend, when the New York Times blew the whole issue’s plot, complete with a headline that spoiled the ending.If you’re keen to know what happens on Batman’s big day, you can read here, but be warned: the NYT really did ruin the story. (And anyone repeating spoilers in the comments below is likely to be the subject of vigilante action by annoyed Bat-fans for which the  cannot take responsibility.)So why did the NYT run such a clanger? Presumably it was with the blessing of DC Comics, in a bid to drum up sales for the issue (DC has been approached for a comment to see if that’s the case or if the newspaper had obtained an advance copy and decided to blow the gaff off its own bat – pun entirely intended.) John Cunningham, DC’s senior vice president of sales, took to Facebook claiming it was a pre-emptive move to stop someone else spoiling the story by posting scans on the internet. “While the Times piece is more fulsome than some might like,” he wrote, “it does not spoil the shock ending of the book for fans.”Comic studios are not generally averse to leaking big events to get a bit of news: the death of Superman in 1992 and Marvel’s Spider-Man in 2011 both became global news before anyone had even read them. Nobody was expecting a quiet marriage with Clark Kent bringing a toaster and the Teen Titans getting drunk on WKD – but it’s safe to say few were expecting the ending of the whole story to appear in the NYT days before its release.Whether this move translates into a boost in sales for DC remains to be seen. When the NYT piece went online, even King didn’t seem to anticipate the spoilers, asking readers to ignore them and imploring them to buy the comic regardless. When DC themselves promoted the NYT piece (suggesting some degree of cooperation), fans were quick to take umbrage, with many announcing they were going to take the issue off their “pull list” (the titles saved for them by their local comic shop).“DC dropped the ball. Hard. The issue is already spoiled,” complained one. “What are people paying $3.99 for now? Comic stores will lose a lot of sales because of this,” raged another. A least one comic shop did report this effect: RJ Comics and Toys in Virginia told DC: “I have loyal Batman customers emailing me to take Batman off their pull. Thank you for this.” Perhaps this upset was the only way to trump the outcome of the couple’s not-so-happy day. All we’ll say here is that if you did buy Bruce and Selina that towel set, make sure you can find the receipt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dddf5819c2a18ac18311a007781ea0133b1767a2/0_118_5277_3166/master/5277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d8216706148844be107f3f001d3f5c2","title":"fascists basket makers unite women only festival","story":"Vaginal steaming is a mixed bag, as health pursuits go. I’ve never tried it and there isn’t much peer-reviewed literature on the matter – but from what I know of the debate, Gwyneth Paltrow is in one corner, singing its praises for hormonal balance, and all of gynaecology is in the other, saying this is a stupid thing to do, the vagina is self-cleaning, has a delicately balanced environment of flora and bacteria, the hormones are generated in the fallopian tubes anyway, which are nowhere near any steam, and also, you might burn yourself.What a shame, therefore, to find it on the programme for the nation’s first women-only festival, scheduled this August in Somerset. As if they weren’t already going to be mocked enough: for the wild foraging and the workshops entitled “Shamanic Journey Into Unity Consciousness” for the headline act, TreeSisters for the basket-making and the DJ promising a set about sacred sexuality.And yet, steaming or no steaming, mockery in this instance is rendered speechless. The event simply outflanks any attempt to ridicule it. Which is when it dawned on me that they’ve done this on purpose: it is a world-class trolling event, purpose-built to give Rod Liddle and Richard Littlejohn aneurysms. Doubtless, when you get there, it will be sunshine and snakebite and the raw, lusty amusement of being everything your detractors say you are, and then some.There will be dissenting voices on the feminist side: in the quest for the universal acceptance of equality, wouldn’t it be better not to look so cranky? This ignores the one true property of chauvinism, that it is never satisfied. You can spend your life compromising and appeasing, moving closer to them accepting that steaming your vagina has no medical basis and that you probably are not able to communicate directly with a tree, that foraging is a self-indulgent hobby for people who could perfectly well afford wild lovage in a farmers’ market, and they’ll still want more. They won’t be happy until you accept “menstrual” as a dirty word and deride female company as, in essence, second-rate. And even if you roll over to all that, they’ll vote for Jacob Rees-Mogg anyway, and wham, you’ll lose your reproductive rights, thanks. A little pushback is well overdue.It is a useful parable for Angela Merkel, who woke up this morning in a fix: she has been rolling over to the demands of her interior minister – Horst Seehofer, leader of her partner party, the CSU – and his preferred immigration policy of Germany-for-the-Bavarians. Already, he has been accommodated to a degree that goes against what any reasonable leader would make of the refugee crisis: he wants Germany’s borders closed to anyone already registered in another EU country, and Merkel has introduced a slew of almost-measures – agreements with inidual nations to reduce this “secondary migration”.She has accepted the fundamentals of Seehofer’s argument, despite the fact that “You keep them, you’re where they landed” is a poor one. It is no way to equitably distribute displaced people it’s politics as a game of musical chairs, one that is rigged because some of the chairs are much closer to the sea. It demands, furthermore, an end to the open-border policy that is a cornerstone of European cooperation. And, inevitably, it wasn’t enough. Seehofer is still causing trouble. It would never have been enough. Compromise only emboldens the absolutist.In fairness to Merkel, she has striven to make the humanitarian case for refuge but, hitting obstacles, she has surrendered to the realpolitik she sees across Europe if someone hits you with nationalism, come back with some soft-nationalism. In Emmanuel Macron’s tougher stance against homeless migrants in Theresa May’s hostile environment everywhere the far right advances, you can see spurts of bitter cruelty, tossed like fresh meat into the cage of a lion that won’t be satisfied until it’s savaged the whole zebra.It’s not even a left-right issue: it’s hard-right versus everyone else. One side repudiates all humanitarian responsibilities, the other scrambles to negotiate which scraps of decency we’re allowed to keep. The mainstream moves myopically into a new reality of the right’s creation. Are we allowed some refugees if they’re women? If they’re children? If we see a picture of a dead one on a beach? If we promise to harass them and keep them in poverty once they arrive? If we let most drown, can we take the few that could swim? The values that underpin the principle of sanctuary, being enshrined in international law, are considered too obvious to restate. But without them, we are reduced to only such generosity as the other side will allow – which is, on current form, none.Fascism is on the march: from racism to misogyny, from the usual suspects (Hungary, Turkey) to previous beacons of social democracy – Denmark’s new “ghetto” laws are terrifying, the audacity as chilling as the ambition. It will not be sated. It can only be opposed: with tree wisdom and steam – which are really just forms of celebrating difference without shame – with fearlessness, with whatever you’ve got."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82845437d21d4f6b6ea1706b355fb6a03c093a37/0_264_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c2bd97feed9f43a64ceae5d0751cef","title":"lgbt dorms gay students safe sheffield university","story":"For teenagers, leaving the family home and moving to college for the first time can be one of the most anxiety-producing events of their young lives. They will be in a new environment not knowing a soul, and will have to figure out, many for the first time, how to feed themselves and do their own laundry. (Just throw it all in the washer on cold, kids, and it will turn out fine.) But there is a particular anxiety for LGBT youth headed off to college, many of whom might still be in the closet. There is the fear of ridicule and alienation from their peers, and of violence against them. To combat this, the University of Sheffield recently announced that in the next academic year it would provide accommodation for LGBT students that would serve as a “safe space for students to be themselves”. It has received 30 applications for the 12 rooms and vows to offer more designated spaces in the future.This led to an article in the Times saying the university had been “warned about ghettoising LGBT students”. It seems to forget that gay people for decades have chosen to live in “gaybourhoods” in large cities, not simply to be able to live as their authentic selves, but also to ensure their safety. For many LGBT people, a ghetto is exactly what they are looking for. There are some that even want the queer community to have an independent nation.Even so, these fears of segregation seem largely unfounded. By no means is it compulsory for students who identify with one of the colours of the LGBT rainbow to live in these rooms. The flats are near more traditional housing so students can mingle.In the Times, Simon Thompson, the director of Accommodation for Students, the UK’s largest university housing service, made it clear he did not approve of Sheffield’s plan nor a similar one at Georgetown University in Washington DC. “University is about opening your horizons and meeting people from different cultures, different backgrounds, different sexualities, everything,” he said. “It’s a disadvantage if people close themselves off and don’t socialise with straight people. It seems like madness to me.”On the contrary, the idea that college students, perhaps the most social humans on the planet, will only befriend those in their immediate vicinity is madness. Anyone who has a degree knows that, over four years, friends are made from among a wide swath of people, both inside and outside of one’s subject area and accommodation block. Thompson is right that college life should prepare kids for wider society beyond university. But the fledgling queers of this world need a place where they feel like they belong to gain the confidence needed to operate in the world at large. This living arrangement doesn’t hinder their ability to integrate, it optimises it.For many, the social aspect of university life is just as important as what one learns in classes. What straight critics of LGBT dorm life fail to realise is that this is something that gay young people, especially those from more rural or conservative areas, have dreamed about. They finally get the chances that all the other youngsters had in high school: to be around people just like them, with the same interests, to be able to flirt with and ask out those they fancy without the fear that their romantic yearnings will lead to exposure, bullying, or worse. This is especially true for trans students living as their confirmed gender for the first time.Heading off to college is hard enough. Let’s give LGBT young people the gift of only having to worry about the things that all college kids worry about, like figuring out the laundry. (For that, the same rules apply. Just stick it on cold.)• Brian Moylan is a pop culture writer who lives in New York"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6fd15e3eba12ef3d0253154aafe0258a96cb7ba/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83cf48c147fd2f2f291fb3b3983a2926","title":"mexico narco nightmare amnesty traffickers","story":"Mexico sees itself today on the brink of change. The new president, the silver-haired Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has a mandate to renew the country’s politics, awarded to him by a people exasperated with poverty, outrageous inequality and corruption in daily life, and pervasive, brutal violence.López Obrador’s accession follows the bloodiest 12 months in the bloodiest decade since the Mexican revolution. So what are his options in the wake of the catastrophic “war on drugs”, lost to the tune of up to 250,000 Mexican lives since December 2006, with another 30,000 people missing? Mexican society itself has become brutalised, beyond even the narco-bloodletting, and the crimes that blight daily life are committed with shocking levels of impunity.Something has to radically change, and it is hard to imagine why any young voter would have endorsed the heirs to serial failures by President Felipe Calderón of the National Action party. Calderón kicked the hornets’ nest in 2006, taking on the cartels and unleashing the bloodshed. His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, restored the Institutional Revolutionary party and continued the war, to no effect, along with an even more grotesque record of corruption within his government.Mexican citizens suffer a related, raw fear of contagious violence. Its roots might lie in narco-traffic but the carnage has now spread way beyond it. It’s a culture of violence that was previously contained but is now geographically ubiquitous. There now comes a five-month transition period before López Obrador’s inauguration – a potentially fearsome limbo, after which the new president must find an efficacy in confronting this violence where his predecessors have failed.Mexico’s is a war I saw at close range, while writing a book about the bloodbath between cartels and the state. Narco-cartels are corporations – astute and effective – and a clientelist system of government has cohabited with them for decades, in alliances and modes of conviviality that mutate as one generation and modus operandi of criminal syndicate bequeaths another.López Obrador may just continue the tradition, though he promises to break with two of its central propositions. One is a fusing of the army and police into a single national guard under presidential authority. For all the warnings of authoritarian “Chavismo”, this might have an effect on the insidious network that connects layers of police and military authority with various cartels. The other, more widely discussed, is an “amnesty” for drug traffickers. But to whom would this amnesty apply? If the incoming president plans a pardon for small-time operators, gang fighters who carve turf or sell on the expanding domestic market, he takes an interesting step towards the effective legalisation of some quarters of narco-traffic.Amnesty for crime at all levels will lead people to ask: where does amnesty end and impunity begin? Amnesty for organisations such as the Marxist Farc in Colombia is offered in exchange for disarmament there’s no sign of that from the Sinaloa cartel, Los Zetas or the rising Jalisco New Generation. Will the amnesty apply, for instance, to people such as the former governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte, with whom I had my own menacing encounter in 2012? He is now awaiting trial on organised crime and money-laundering charges.In Mexico – as in the international system that launders drug money – the line between legality and illegality is a lie cartels ersify well beyond drug money into oil, minerals, tourism and so on. Will the amnesty shrug in acceptance of this, and, if so, what is supposed to change?There is one major step López Obrador could take. The drug war can never be won in or by Mexico alone – the struggle against narco-traffic, its violence and profits must be global and entail an entire international rethink.Eight years ago, at the summit of American states in Cartagena, Colombia, the host, President Juan Manuel Santos, threw down the gauntlet to drug-consuming countries in Europe and North America, where refined noses snort lines acquired at the expense of horrendous bloodshed, and the profits are laundered by banks such as Wachovia and HSBC, also with effective impunity (although both paid substantial fines).Those countries, said Santos, must accept their co-responsibility for the violence that Colombia – and Mexico – suffer, and assume a role in combating it that begins at home, not with yet more war in the “producing” and “transit” countries. Europe and the US (even before Donald Trump) have resisted Santos’s plea, and his forthcoming replacement as Colombian president, Iván Duque, will propose nothing of the sort. López Obrador, if he has the wit and wisdom – which cannot be presumed – will resurrect Santos’s cause and speak for not just Mexico’s but Latin America’s impatience with this nightmare.Journalists report like vultures on Mexico’s ultra-violence and hyper-cruelty, but it is a country where most daily encounters are life-affirming, invariably delightful – with resourceful, kind and hospitable people a country deep and rich in history and culture. The dichotomy highlights something in Mexico worth liberating from the horrors.During his campaign, López Obrador has had the audacity to evoke past presidents José María Morelos, Benito Juárez and Francisco Madero, greater men than him for sure, but whom he claims to want to emulate. These presidents did advance the best in Mexico against the worst.If López Obrador wants to even doff a sombrero to that heritage, he cannot just have an “amnesty” in response to the failure of the war on drugs. He must start to uproot the violence with solid strategies – on education, women’s rights, alleviation of poverty, ending cronyism and impunity. If he is to succeed he must nurture Mexico’s resourceful creativity and rewrite the war on drugs as a political war on war itself.• Ed Vulliamy is author of Amexica: War Along the Borderline"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a5e931d9d2eb16a0ba797628c5e45874b8e73a/0_245_2200_1321/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bab01f655ea00ee7c1d88101e9eaf57f","title":"the guardian view on mexicos new president there is an alternative","story":"Why did Mexico fall so hard for the 64-year-old Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as Amlo?

But\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspLópez\u0026nbspObrador won largely because his opponents championed the technocratic, free-market approach that has dominated Mexico since the mid-1980s. That has conspicuously failed to deliver the promised growth to alleviate poverty. Meanwhile violence skyrocketed and corruption soaked the body politic.A self-styled leftwing outsider, Mr López Obrador is no newcomer to politics. He won his country’s presidency after two failed attempts. Winning may have been the easy part. Governing, as Mr López Obrador knows from his stint as mayor of Mexico City, is harder. Although the presidency is a powerful post, his new party is unlikely to win a two-thirds majority in Mexico’s Congress, which is the threshold for big constitutional reforms. On the campaign trail Mr López Obrador promised to sell the presidential planes, turn the presidential palace into a public park and to halve his salary. But he also ran on a surprisingly sober business agenda overlaid with flashes of economic nationalism.In his victory speech Mr López Obrador sensibly signalled a shift away from the militarised response to drug cartels that has palpably failed. The question he has yet to answer is how to enforce the rule of law in a\u0026nbspcountry where murders have reached the level of an armed conflict. On the economy, the new president has made it clear that he views Mr Trump’s Nafta negotiations as an opportunity rather than a calamity. Given its natural resources, it is remarkable that Mexico imports so much US food produce.Mr López Obrador wants to be food independent but has yet to explain how this would be achieved. Mexico is a young democracy run until 2000 by one party. It is now a tolerant, secular state which has survived economic and democratic crises. There\u0026nbspare\u0026nbspno serious prospects of regional secession.

It is documented at least 40 times in Hansard – used by two prime ministers, four secretaries of state and numerous ministers – and is cited repeatedly by the DfE press office.Andrews, who is the deputy head of research at the Education Policy Institute (EPI) thinktank, but was working in the department when the controversial statistic first took hold, is calling on the government to ditch the claim as he says it does not represent a fair comparison.“It is easy to see why it is used,” said Andrews. “It’s snappy, it’s easy for non-specialists to understand, it’s factually accurate and, the ultimate for lines to take, it’s an impressively big number. “The problem is that it fails an important test of any statistic – it does not show the user what the producer believes it shows.“In this case, it does not adequately demonstrate that standards in schools have improved since 2010, at least not to the extent that a quarter of all pupils are in significantly better schools because of any policy intervention.”Andrews, writing in an EPI research paper, said one of the problems with the statistic is it does not reflect the significant growth in pupil numbers of 560,000 between 2010 and 2017.It also fails to take into account the large numbers of schools not inspected by Ofsted for many years – 124,000 pupils are in schools that have not been inspected for 10 years – and the possible impact of a new Ofsted grading system, he said. “Academic standards continue to rise, with more pupils reaching the expected standard in maths at the end of primary school and 154,000 more six-year-olds on track to become fluent readers since the phonics check was introduced in 2012.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1b46ad1d802673790dde190c665a5c6952fded/0_46_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5589dc994ed8dfbfe98be942d860c2d","title":"botanical life in close up in pictures","story":"Colin Salter’s new book is a selection of extraordinary electron microscopic images of the plant world around us, including seeds, pollen, fruiting bodies, trees and leaves, flowers, vegetables and fruit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e842c4a0f4c9cd1877b7459384ebecc2d8b063ac/55_86_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fdd0875666351223a47eb061f91f34","title":"arsenal sokratis papastathopoulos borussia dortmund transfer","story":"Arsenal have completed the signing of the Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund for a fee of €20m (£17.7m).The 30-year-old defender, who has won 79 caps for his country, was identified as one of Unai Emery’s prime transfer targets after the Spaniard took over from Arsène Wenger as manager.He has signed a “long-term contract” and becomes Emery’s third completed signing after the purchase of the German goalkeeper Bernd Leno for £19m from Bayer Leverkusen and the arrival of the 34-year-old Switzerland full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner on a free transfer from Juventus.The former AEK Athens defender joins his former Dortmund team-mates, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, at the Emirates Stadium. “They said to me the best things about this club, that it is one big family and of course they also called me not every day but a lot of times telling me to come here,” Papastathopoulos said.Papastathopoulos, described by his former manager Thomas Tuchel as “a little obsessed with defending”, made 28 Bundesliga appearances last season having established himself as a mainstay of Dortmund’s defence since joining from Werder Bremen in 2013.

It was his goal that broke the deadlock and if his influence on this game was far more positive than in any in the group stage, it was almost entirely because he played without that same furious determination to be the protagonist.But, of course, he is the same Neymar, the same a who must always be the centre of attention. Just when everything seemed to be going well, just when it seemed there might be an argument he was growing into his role, he reacted ludicrously as Miguel Layún picked the ball from between his feet as he lay by the side of the pitch. Perhaps the Mexican midfielder did brush his ankle but the fourth official was roughly six inches away and saw nothing untoward, and neither did VAR.Neymar, though, bucked and writhed as though he had just trodden on the third rail. Within seconds, once no card had been produced, he was back up and running as normal. It was hard to paint that as anything but the most scandalous simulation by a player who combines the most sublime skill with the most shameful self-indulgence.It was a great shame, for until then everything had been going so well, both for Neymar and the team that keeps threatening to emerge from his shadow. Until they tired towards the end of the first half, Mexico had controlled possession and territory. Neymar had been reduced to a peripheral role, an occasional outlet, played high up field to be a conduit for breakaways, to attack Edson Álvarez, something he did so well in combination with Philippe Coutinho that it was Brazil who looked the more dangerous. But at half-time it remained goalless and there was a sense that Brazil could be facing a long battle in the sapping heat.But six minutes into the second half Neymar picked up the ball on the left. In familiar style he skipped inside, scuttling past his full-back. Mexico got back, packed the edge of the box. It seemed certain that Neymar would take on a right-footed shot and the ball would be blocked. But then he did something utterly unexpected: he passed.It was a backheel, but this was not one of his needless tricks designed to showcase his own ability or demean a defender, punishing them for having the temerity to stand up to him. This was a pragmatic backheel, one that changed the shape of the attack, that set Willian, making a crossover run, in space on the left side of the box. He crossed low and Neymar was there at the back post to claim his reward.As a parable of the benefits of playing for the team it could hardly have been bettered.The goal was not just a symbol of Neymar’s improved display, but of Tite’s clever gameplan. There were moments of rapid interplay, little darts and flurries that gave an indication of a potentially great side lying not too far beneath the surface. For all that Mexico offered the idea of a threat, only a string of fine saves from Guillermo Ochoa, reprising his excellent display against Brazil in the last World Cup, prevented Brazil from having the game comfortably sewn up before the hour. The game was eventually sealed by Roberto Firmino a minute from time. Neymar will claim an assist, although there is no doubt he was shooting when Ochoa deflected the ball into the path of the Liverpool forward.But this side is about far more than Neymar. This is a Brazil of many parts that are looking increasingly coherent despite a possible weakness at full-back. Fagner, brought in at right-back in place of Danilo, struggled against both Carlos Vela and Hirving Lozano, who switched flanks repeatedly as though both were desperate to have a go at Dani Alves’s replacement’s replacement.Set against that apparent vulnerability, though, is Brazil’s most underrated quality. They are prepared to play without the ball, prepared to draw opponents on, and the two central defenders, Thiago Silva and Miranda, protected by Casemiro, are good enough to at least restrict the clear chances they give up.Yet to an extent Mexico were complicit in their own impotence. It has been a feature of Mexico’s tournament so far that they do not make the most of their chances, that they sweep forward in green waves that do not necessarily produce much, a result of a lack of ruthlessness with the final ball and perhaps of a reluctance on the part of the midfield to get forward and support the forward line. Decision-making, again and again, let them down.But it would be wrong to portray this as the Germany game redux, just with a different result. There was a sense of control about Brazil that Germany never approached, a feeling throughout that they were holding Mexico at arm’s length, restricting them, by the end, to hopeful charges at the box or speculative long-range efforts.It was a game won with an impressive defensive performance and enough attacking flair that it always seemed a matter of when rather than if they would score. There are even signs that Neymar is beginning to use his talent for the collective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d50852bb89afd403dcb02f5e4deddb708904469a/193_66_1910_1146/master/1910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a1c54c0fe0dfee14d532a1ebd8a53f5","title":"england colombia world cup 1998 carlos valderrama graeme le saux","story":"The challenge for England against Colombia at the Spartak Stadium on Tuesday evening is to emulate the feat of Glenn Hoddle’s side 20 years ago: win.Whereas Gareth Southgate hopes to progress to the World Cup quarter-finals, Hoddle needed victory in Lens to ensure passage to the last 16 of France 98.The England XI sent out by Hoddle was captained by Alan Shearer and featured Michael Owen making his full competitive debut and David Beckham his first start of the tournament.Southgate was also in the squad but after being selected for the opening game, a 2-0 victory over Tunisia in Marseille, he did not feature again until the last-16 meeting with Argentina.Despite the opening win, England had to beat Colombia after losing the middle Group G match 2-1 to Romania. Owen had equalised on 81 minutes, after replacing Teddy Sheringham, only for Dan Petrescu’s goal in the closing moments to claim three points.That strike came following an error by Graeme Le Saux. “It was probably the hardest game for me against Colombia because of the mistake,” he says. “I got absolutely hammered from all quarters and knew I couldn’t afford to put myself in a position to make a mistake.Le Saux is referencing Beckham’s red card in the meeting with Argentina in Saint-Étienne, but that was to come later. The defeat by Romania meant England’s fate rested on their ability to handle the pressure of needing to beat Colombia, as will be the case in Moscow.Hoddle retained the 3-4-1-2 of previous matches. This had Darren Anderton and Le Saux as wing-backs, Gary Neville, Sol Campbell and Tony Adams in defence, Beckham and Paul Ince in midfield, and Paul Scholes behind Owen and Shearer, with David Seaman the No\u0026nbsp1.Just as Southgate wants England to dominate the ball, via three centre-backs, Hoddle believed the formation would allow his team to do the same against a side managed by Hernán Darío Gómez, who was in charge of Panama at this World Cup.Le Saux says: “There’s a style in which the South American teams play, which is something we’ll have to adapt to. That’s why Colombia came into this tournament as one of my dark horses.”He also points to comparisons between Colombia’s record scorer, the 32-year-old Radamel Falcao of José Pekerman’s team, and Carlos Valderrama of the side he lined up against.“The funny thing with Valderrama was he had loads of bracelets on. He literally jangled. Every time he received the ball you could hear him. It was like a sleigh because you could hear all his bangles jiggling about. Then his hair had its own sort of gravitational field, so you could sense him coming either by listening or feeling that his hair was somewhere in your vicinity.”After 20 minutes, England proved they were up to the occasion. Owen dispossessed Luis Antonio Moreno along the right, ran down the wing and crossed towards Scholes. Jorge Bermúdez headed away but only to Anderton, who lashed home from a tight angle. Nine minutes later, Beckham bent a 20-yard free-kick past Faryd Mondragón and the contest was over.The next match against Argentina was unhappier all-round for England and, on a personal level, for Beckham and Hoddle. Two minutes into the second half, the midfielder kicked out at Diego Simeone and was sent off.England held on at 2-2 for penalties but lost the shootout 4-3, following David Batty’s miss. Beckham became the national scapegoat Le Saux mentioned and Hoddle never managed at a major tournament again. He lost his job in February 1999 following comments he made about his religious beliefs in a newspaper interview.Regarding England’s challenge against the current Colombia team Le Saux says: “With some of the usual suspects going out early it seems between the traditional national sides who are successful and those you’d say are the minnows the margins have got much smaller. There’s a new world order.”England’s hope is to beat Colombia, and take a further step towards showing they belong in it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031cb881764b755120b7348fda98d1c630d2cf58/1212_593_2705_1623/master/2705.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a726315522ab1487d6f0aaffcc12c66","title":"ngolo kante class world cup france","story":"Henri Langlois would have understood the genius of N’Golo Kanté. More than 60 years ago the founder of the Cinémathèque Française revived interest in the career of an obscure American actress of the silent era with a famous quote: “There is no Garbo! There is no Dietrich! There is only Louise Brooks!”It was hyperbole, of course. There were lots of other worthwhile things in cinema, just as there are other things in football besides a 5ft 6in midfielder born 27 years ago in a Paris suburb. But more than ever after last Saturday, it is tempting to feel that way about the player in France’s No\u0026nbsp13 shirt. There is no Ronaldo! There is no Messi! There is only N’Golo Kanté!There are qualities about Kanté that speak with a rare\u0026nbspclarity of the game at its best and purest, of how humility, altruism, diligence and devotion to the collective cause can survive and prosper even amid the hyperinflated circus of modern sport.Something else that Langlois said about Brooks could equally apply, with a few words changed to suit subject and context, to the man who won England’s three major player-of-the-year awards in 2017: “He is the intelligence of the footballing process, the perfect incarnation of all that is football, with complete naturalness and complete simplicity. His art is so pure that it becomes invisible.”Kanté’s role in France’s resplendent fourth goal on Saturday, the one that broke Argentinian hearts on surely one of the most enthralling days in the history of the World Cup, was typical in its near-invisibility. With the ball at Hugo Lloris’s feet, he made himself available just beyond the edge of the penalty area. Taking possession, he made a couple of steps before releasing the ball to Antoine Griezmann, who was dropping off close to the centre spot. It looked like nothing special, but it was. As always with Kanté, the seemingly straightforward pass was delivered with a pace, a weight and an angle that helped the receiver to decide his next move. From Griezmann the ball flowed swiftly via Blaise Matuidi and Olivier Giroud to the scorer, Kylian Mbappé.This aspect of Kanté’s skill – this fundamental relevance – is reminiscent of the great Claude Makelele, his predecessor in the blue of Chelsea and France. But Kanté covers more ground at higher speed and is sharper in the interception. On Saturday, with the stakes at their highest, he kept Lionel Messi as quiet as anyone ever will.There is also a greater range to his game, something which his ego-free attitude permits him to reveal only sparingly. Five minutes after that fourth goal he dispossessed Ángel Di María deep in his own half, quickly weighed up the situation and decided that for once the best option was not an instant pass but a 50-metre solo sprint with the ball. When the moment was right, he produced a caviar-laden pass from which Mbappé ought to have completed his hat-trick.And yet Kanté seems to have nothing to do with the world created by social media. He has no profile, no brand. Although no one could be more committed to the idea of victory and the team, he takes no prominent role in displays of extreme emotion. He is usually on the fringes when a goal is celebrated. He refrains from arguing with officials. (On Saturday he seemed briefly on the brink of making a complaint about something, but thought better of it.)The intrinsic worth of such a player has nothing to do with the values of the market. Probably only his colleagues appreciate how much he brings. As Zinedine Zidane said in 2003, commenting on Real Madrid’s decision to sell Makelele in order to buy David Beckham: “Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you’re losing the entire engine?”Maybe it’s a sign of how far English football has progressed that Kanté is so warmly and widely appreciated. We can be proud that he has flourished in the Premier League, emulating his compatriot Eric Cantona’s feat of winning the title in consecutive seasons with different clubs. What is hard to understand is why, given the opportunity to study the likes of Makelele, Javier Mascherano and Kanté at close quarters, the men who run the FA technical centre at St George’s Park have not set up a special department devoted to helping young English players acquire and refine their priceless attributes.From the response to the weekend’s\u0026nbspmatches in Russia, of course, it would appear that, following\u0026nbspthe departures of Ronaldo and Messi, there is only Mbappé, the 19-year-old who possesses a rare attribute described to me 20 years ago\u0026nbspby Gérard Houllier, a former France manager, when discussing another of his nation’s prodigies at the same age: “You can be fast without the ball or, like Nicolas Anelka, fast with the ball.”In the same conversation Houllier tipped Anelka as a future winner of the Ballon d’Or. That didn’t happen, and Mbappé’s predecessor – another son of the Parisian banlieues – had a troubled relationship with the World Cup. Left out in 1998, 2002 and 2006, he was sent home early from South Africa in 2010 after an altercation with the head coach, Raymond Domenech.Maybe the comparatively placid Mbappé is destined to become the central figure of this World Cup, just as the\u0026nbsporiginal Ronaldo, another player he resembles, was when Brazil recaptured the trophy in 2002. But if he does, he won’t have achieved it without the platform provided by a player who inspires deeper feelings than even the most spectacular solo goal can evoke. For those who cherish the game’s more profound characteristics, N’Golo Kanté is football."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b02fa2de3f58b2f723fca85fc469e390e9b3416/0_245_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=748f36023a279ec5d8f02bd68f4fcafc","title":"now we can forget turkey modric and croatia lay ghost of 2008 to rest","story":"Luka Modric’s mind went back to Euro 2008. Everybody’s in Croatia did. The midfielder had blown a 117th-minute penalty to win Sunday night’s World Cup last-16 tie for his country against Denmark and all he could think about was Turkey.It was the defeat that scarred a generation of Croatian footballers and fans. They had faced Turkey in the quarter-final of the European Championship – it was then the first knockout round – and, when Ivan Klasnic put them 1-0 up in the last minute of extra time, the victory appeared to be theirs.It had been a dire game, with chances at a premium but, incredibly, Turkey’s Semih Şentürk found an equaliser in the 122nd minute. Croatia were crushed and they would lose the penalty shootout. Modric missed his kick. So did Ivan Rakitic.The parallels with the Denmark game were vivid. In 2008 Croatia had breezed through the group phase, winning each of their three ties, including a 2-1 victory over Germany. They had played some lovely stuff. But against Turkey, they hit the wall. Their cohesion evaporated, together with their spirit of adventure.Here in Russia, Croatia won all three group games, including a 3-0 thumping of Argentina. Their football was slick, incisive and ruthless. But the Denmark match brought another freeze. What was going on?There is a further strand to the tale. At Euro 2016 Croatia had taken seven points from an available nine to advance as group winners. They beat Spain 2-1 in the final group match. But against Portugal in the last 16 they did not play. A dismal game was locked at 0-0 in extra time and heading for penalties when Ricardo Quaresma conjured a 117th-minute winner for Portugal.Since the 1998 World Cup, when Croatia famously reached the semi-final, they had not won a knockout tie at a World Cup or European Championship, an extraordinary statistic given the talent that has been in their ranks. Before Sunday they had not even appeared in another World Cup knockout game and so when Modric saw his weak penalty saved by the Denmark goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, the demons circled and shrieked.It is almost impossible to imagine the pressure on the players in the shootout, although the Denmark manager, Åge Hareide, offered some insight. “Research has proven during penalty shootouts that your adrenaline and stress levels are as high as when you are in a war zone,” he said.Modric stepped up to take Croatia’s third penalty, his team trailing 2-1. This time his kick was even softer. He placed it with little conviction down the middle and how his heart must have jumped when Schmeichel, who moved to the left, struck out a trailing leg in an attempt to save. But the ball went in.Modric had won the most intense of personal battles and his team would do likewise. When Croatia’s goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic, made his third save of the shootout, the scene was set for Rakitic to win it. In another redemption story, a further piece of symmetry, he found the net. Croatia exploded in relief.“The victory says a lot about our spirit,” Modric said. “I said before the game that since 2008 we had never passed the first knockout game and it was very important for us to take the monkey off our back. And we did it. It was not easy because the Turkey game was still in our minds. I think it was in everyone’s minds because it was so tough for us, that defeat.“With me missing a penalty in the last few minutes, we needed to have big character and team spirit and everything to stay calm and focused and win the game. With this, I think we can now forget about Turkey. Will it change the mentality? I hope so.”It should be noted that Modric, after his penalty miss, continued to demand the ball he did not run or hide. And there was never any question over whether he would take a kick in the shootout.A monkey off their backs? This was a whole troop of them. The hope is that Croatia, arguably the team of the tournament during the group phase, can rediscover their freedom. Modric has rarely looked so happy after a game and he was all smiles as he spoke to reporters in the mixed zone. Next for Croatia is a quarter-final against Russia on Saturday.“From the first game of this World Cup, we have showed character and mentality,” Modric said. “And we showed it again against Denmark. This team has character, that is without doubt. But now we need to continue. This team can do much more. Hopefully, we will do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a763a39298c44cd3c215045023589b1be44ea7a/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12f92366d5d20634e53df9c1e18233fb","title":"world cup 2018 belgium v japan live","story":"“Referring to the earlier chart from the Mr. Men book,” writes Ludvig, “I believe Neymar proved during the Mexico v Brazil game that he is the offspring of Mr Bump and Mr Nonsense. Mr Jelly and Mr Noisy are probably also a part of his ancestry though.” I don’t understand why evidently and demonstrably absurd overacting in a bid to waste time (Thiago Silva knocked about four minutes off the game at one point while he received apparently life-saving treatment in the second half today, before getting to his feet and immediately rejoining the fray) or get opponents punished isn’t itself punished, or even talked about. Brazil are one of the best teams in the tournament, but also insufferable thespians.This is what Reuters has to say about the line-ups:The Belgium central defender Vincent Kompany returned to the line-up to face Japan in their World Cup last 16 clash on Monday, his first start at the tournament after picking up a groin strain in a warm-up match a month ago.Kompany, Belgium’s veteran defensive talisman, comes in for Dedryck Boyata and will be partnered by Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in a back three while playmaker Eden Hazard retains the captaincy. Romelu Lukaku is also back as the central striker, with coach Roberto Martinez recalling his biggest-name players after fielding practically a reserve team in their 1-0 win over England in their final Group G game. Japan manager Akira Nishino has picked the same 11 players that drew 2-2 against Senegal in their penultimate group game, restoring Shinji Kagawa, Takashi Inui, Genki Haraguchi and Yuya Osako as his side, as he targets reaching the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time after failing twice in the last 16.Nishino had been criticised for rotating his squad and for his negative tactics in Japan’s 1-0 defeat by Poland in their final Group H game that saw them scrape into the second round. Today’s referee, Malang Diedhiou, lists his occupation as “chief inspector of customs” and his hobbies as reading. This is his third match of the tournament, after Costa Rica 0-1 Serbia and Uruguay 3-0 Russia.Here are the teams again, in a text-only form for those who can’t see embedded tweets.“That kid isn’t paying a guitar, he’s playing a zitar,” writes Bob O’Hara of the photo at the bottom of the page. “The kid next to him is, of course, playing a baby zitar.” It’s not a zitar either. I believe it’s a balalaika. Either that, or it’s Mr Rush (far right, third row down).Apology accepted, and unnecessary. Frankly any excuse to play Alphaville’s 80s stonker is a good thing as far as I’m concerned.Having received this photograph of Japan’s dressing room I can exclusively reveal that their tactics involve kettling the entire Belgium team inside the centre circle.The teams are in, and here they are:There are no African teams left at the World Cup. There are no teams from Oceania, none since Brazil’ win this afternoon from North or Central America. Japan are the last survivors from Asia within a couple of hours this could be an entirely Uefa v Conmebol “World” Cup.This, though, could be quite a match. Belgium rested half their squad for their final group game against England. Japan rested their entire squad for a good part of their final group game, against Poland. So there should be no problem with tiredness. Japan actually have a head-to-head advantage over their opponents, having won two of their five previous meetings and lost only once, 1-0 in Bruges last November.The group is in a very good moment. Mentally and physically, you just get the feeling the players are desperate to be on the pitch. Japan have footballers with an incredible energy and a great capacity to get really high up the pitch very quickly. They know what it takes to win a game of this calibre. This is a group of players that know what they are doing. I expect a very difficult game. They are capable of creating problems due to the dynamic approach that they have.Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa are No1 in Belgium at the moment with One Kiss, but as that’s a former UK chart-topper and thus a little bit boring here’s their No2, La Même by Maître GIMS featuring Vianney:Japan is a bit more complicated, a land it seems of many charts.

There was some needle going on between him and Miguel Layun, a second-half substitute, and at one stage, Neymar found himself sitting on the touchline near the technical areas with the ball out of play and between his outstretched legs.With the fourth official standing right behind Neymar, Layun bent down to pick up the ball and as he did so, stepped on the Brazilian’s ankle. Neymar reacted as if he’d been poked by a cattle prod - writhing around in faux agony in a bid to get the Mexican sent off. His histrionics were comically amateurish and the referee didn’t buy them. Indeed, it may not be too much of a stretch to speculate that Neymar’s ridiculously over-the-top reaction may have helped Layun avoid the red card he deserved for his sneaky stamp. Here’s our on-the-whistle snap report from the Samara Arena, where Neymar and Roberto Firmino got the goals as Brazil advanced to the quarter-finals.It’s time to mark the players out of 10. Among those who impressed your minute-by-minute commentator: for Brazil, Willian was the stand-out player, while Neymar, Philippe Coutinho and Thiago Silva also impressed. Among the Mexicans to do their country proud, Hirving Lozano Hector Herrera and Andres Guardado all had good games, while Guillermo Ochoa was decent between the sticks.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over. Brazil advance to the quarter-finals courtesy of goals from Neymar and Roberto Firmino. They scored two tap-ins from a combined distance of about five yards, but they all count. Mexico exit the competition in the first knockout round for the seventh time in a row.90+5 min: Mexico’s players plug on, but they know the jig is up., Hector Herrera and Layun combine down the right and play the ball inside to Vela, who loses it. 90+4 min: A Layun cross hits Thiago Silva’s head and soars into the air. Alisson waits for it to drop and takes possession. 90+3 min: Spare a thought for Mexico, who are about to exit the World Cup at the same stage of the competition for the seventh consecutive time. They’re nothing if not consistent. I’ve enjoyed watching them play in this tournament and they did well today, particularly in the first half when they gave Brazil plenty to think about.90+1 min: We’re in the first of six recommended minutes of added time. Brazil substitution: Marquinhos on for Willian. While that’s going on, Mexico’s Andres Guardado gets booked for dissent after having a moan at the referee.89 min: It’s another tap-in, with Bobby Firmino poking home from about a foot out. Layun lost possession up the pitch and Neymar galloped towards goal with the ball at his feet. Drawing Guillermo off his line, Neymar tried to toe-poke the ball past the goalkeeper, who got a touch. Unfortunately, he could only help it on its way to Firmino, whose task could not have been simpler at the far post. Brazil double their lead courtesy of the substitute.88 min: On the touchline, Mexico manager Joan Carlos Osorio is going berserk with the fourth official. I know not why.86min: Mexico win a corner when an attempted clearance by Fagner goes out of play. Brazil substitution: Roberto Firmino on for Philippe Coutinho. He comes on before the corner is taken. When the ball’s sent into the mixer, Carlos Vela is penalised for offside84 min: Hugo Ayala plays a long cross-field diagonal to Hector Herrera on the far touchline. He attempts to cut inside but is unable to do so and Mexico end up playing the ball back into their own half.82 min: Thiago Silva goes down injured in his own penalty after a clash with Hirving Lozano. The Mexican caught him in the ribs as he tried to chase the ball to the byline and the Brazilian is milking it for all its worth. There’s a break in play as he receives treatment. 80 min: Fernandinho replaces Paulinho, as Brazil try to shore up their defence. He’ll sit in front of the back four alongside Casemiro in a bid to keep the Mexicans at bay.77 min: Hector Herrera plays a long ball to Hirving Lozano, who traps the ball expertly on the left side of the Brazil box. He tries to pick out Jimenez with a cross, but the ball goes through to Alisson. Goal kick for Brazil.77 min: Carlos Salcedo is booked for a late challenge on Neymar. 76 min: Carlos Vela crosses into the Brazil box from the byline and Casemiro heads clear.73 min: According to ITV’s go-to refereeing expert, Mark Clattenburg, Layun should have been given a red card for violent conduct. It’s unclear whether or not our match referee Gianluca Rocchi was advised by his VAR officials, but he did give Layun a bit of a talking-to after his stamp on Neymar. 71 min: Neymar receives treatment from the Brazil medical team, his face a mask of agony (genuine or pretend). Layun caught him with a sneaky stamp as he went to pick up the ball from between a seated Neymar’s legs by the touchline for a throw-in. Neymar’s subsequent histrionics were ridiculous, but Layun escapes a yellow card.70 min: Neymar goes to ground after a tussle of some sort with Layun and begins rolling around in agony. Replays suggest the Mexican caught him on the ankle. 69 min: Hector Herrera has a shot from the edge of the penalty area blocked. The ball breaks to Andres Guardado, who follows up with a low strike of his own from 25 yards. That too is blocked. 67 min: Brazil drive forward on the counter with Willian on the ball as he gallops down the left and Neymar and Gabriel Jesus up in support. Willian picks out Neymar, whose low rasping shot is deflected narrowly wide of the upright for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 65 min: Forced to go in search of a goal, Mexico are looking increasingly vulnerable and fatigued since going behind and you’d expect another Brazil goal would finish them off altogether. Where there’s life there’s hope, however, and Lozano drills the ball low and hard across the face of the Brazil goal. There’s nobody on hand in a green shirt to poke the ball home.64 min: At the other end of the field, Ochoa is forced into action, saving Willian’s rising drive and putting the ball out for a corner. 63 min: Casemiro has picked up a yellow card for some indiscretion or other. Amid all the excitement, I missed whatever it was he did to dirty his bib. In more informative news, Carlos Vela brings a smart save out of Alisson, with a shot from distance the goalkeeper was forced to tip on to his crossbar. 60 min: Final Mexico substitution: Javier Hernandez off, Wolves new boy Raul Jimenez on.58 min: Brazil go forward, with Filipe Luis on the ball. He lays it off to Neymar on the edge of the box. He finds Willian, who plays a weighted pass to Fagner, who pulls the ball back to Paulinho. His rising drive from 18 yards is saved by Ochoa. 57 min: Mexican substitution just before that free-kick: Jonathan Dos Santos on for right-back Edson Alvarez. 56 min: Brazil win a free-kick wide on the right for a Hector Herrera foul on Willian. The Mexican picks up a booking that will rule him out of the next match, should Mexico prevail in this one. Neymar takes the free-kick and sends the ball into the Mexican penalty area, Hugo Ayala heads clear.54 min: Mexico win a corner after having a penalty appeal turned down for a Thiago Silva tackle on Carlos Vela in the Brazil penalty area. The ball’s played long to Layun, who chests it down and unleashes a shot. It’s deflected to Alisson.53 min: Neymar backheels to Willian on the edge of the Mexico penalty area and continues a curling run into the box towards goal. Willian drives through the penalty area and drills the ball low and hard across the face of goal. At the far post, Neymar is second in the queue of Brazilians waiting to poke hime. He does exactly that from about three yards.The favourites take the lead courtesy of Neymar.50 min: Mexico attack on the break from a Brazil corner and their left-back Jesus Gallardo unleashes a shot from distance. High and wide.48 min: Neymar wins a corner off Layun and plays the ball quickly to Philippe Coutinho. They make their way towards the Mexican penalty area where Philippe Coutinho is able to cut inside on to his right foot and unleash a rasping drive from just inside the penalty area. Guillermo Ochoa es to his right and saves. 47 min: Hugo Ayala hacks clear as Brazil try to play the ball through the gap between himself and Gallardo.46 min: Brazil get the ball rolling, while Mexico have made one substitute at half-time. Miguel Layun is on for the veteran Raphael Marquez, who may have played his last game for his country unless they win this match.It’s been a fascinating contest: Mexico have been causing Brazil a lot of problems, stretching Brazil and trying to isolate their full-backs, before taking them on. Their tactic of placing three players on the halfway line for Brazil corners is risky, but is paying idends. Brazil have to keep men back to keep an eye on them, while their presence is also a huge help for when Mexico attack on the break.The sides are level at the break, with no goals yet. Both sides have had their chances and it’s probably fair to say that both managers will be pleased enough with what they’ve seen. Mexico boss Juan Carlos Osorio has every right to be very pleased indeed with the manner in which his players have gone about their business.42 min: Brazil win a corner and – as they have on each occasion their opponents do so – Mexico position three men on the halfway line, presumably to keep Brazil from bringing their big men forward and to be on hand for any counter-attacks. Brazil take the corner, Mexico break up the pitch and Filipe Luis is booked for hacking down Carlos Vela.40 min: Neymar and Coutinho combine down the left flank and the Barcelona man sends in a cross. It’s overhit, but Willian picks up the ball on the right before unleashing a crossshot from a tight angle. Ochoa gets down quickly to smother the ball. 39 min: Edson Alvarez is booked for a late lunge on Neymar, that leaves the Brazilian lying on the ground holding his leg. Free-kick for Brazil, to the left side of the Mexico penalty area about 30 yards from goal. Neymar takes it, but his effort is a little too high and wide of the Mexican goal.37 min: Philippe Coutinho tries a shot from distance, but it’s blocked on the edge of the Mexico penalty area.35 min: Having been dominated for the opening 20 minutes, Brazil are enjoying a period in the ascendency in what is a fascinating and very absorbing contest.32 min: Paulinho drives through the centre before picking out Willian on his right. Brazil continue to play keep-ball and eventually, Gabriel Jesus cuts into the Mexico penalty area and drives the ball goalwards. Ochoa palms it away and it drops for the Brazilian again about seven yards from goal. His weak, scuffed effort is blocked by Gallardo.31 min: Brazil attack and Neymar gets on the ball. He tries to cut in from the left flank, but is dispossessed by a splendid tackle from Edson Alvarez.29 min: Carlos Vela chooses to shoot from distance when perhaps he should have taken on Fagner and crossed to Javier Hernandez in a good position. His effort is sliced badly wide26 min: Brazil win a free-kick wide on the left. Neymar floats the ball into the penalty area, where Gabriel Jesus gets a flick. After a period of sustained Brazilian pressure, Guillermo Ochoa is forced to punch clear. Gabriel Jesus follows up with a shot that is blocked by Ayala, before Philippe Coutinho fires over the bar. There was blind panic in the Mexican ranks there. 26 min: Guillermo Ochoa has to be quick off his line to block a Neymar shot from a tight angle. The Brazilian No10 had made inroads into the Mexico penalty area after beating Edson Alvarez for pace.24 min: “It’s a bit early to be pressing panic buttons, particularly for this Brazil side, but I think you’d have to say that Mexico have started the better of the two teams,” muses ITV’s co-comms man Ally McCoist.22 min: Carlos Vela picks out Hector Herrera in acres of space on the edge of the penalty area. Instead of hitting it first time, he cuts back on to his left foot and tries to unleash a shot that was smothered. A great scoring opportunity goes to waste for Mexico.20 min: Gabriel Jesus advances into the Mexico penalty area on the left side, turns and passes to Neymar on the edge of it. He runs into a wall of green and is dispossessed.18 min: Carlos Salcedo puts a Willian cross behind for a Brazil corner. It’s taken and Mexico embark on a counter-attack, with Vela picking out Lozano with a cross-field pass. He tries a shot, which is blocked by Felipe Luis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ee4928b4dac9fea8b8ddfe655dcec82ee2e38e/0_9_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a11d124c4a9cf800b6d9617779388f3","title":"amber tamblyn times up me too any man debut novel","story":"‘Nothing about pregnancy is not violent,” says Amber Tamblyn. “Nothing. From the minute you find out and you’re puking everywhere, to the thoughts that run through your head about the things you imagine doing if someone harmed your child.” Pregnancy, she adds, can make you feral.You can’t talk about a new novel that deals with sexual assault without looking at it through the lens of #MeToo, particularly when the author made waves last year after accusing Oscar-nominated actor James Woods of preying on her when she was 16 (Woods denies the allegations). Tamblyn is also one of the founders of Time’s Up, an organisation launched at the beginning of this year to fight sexual harassment in the film industry.However, Tamblyn’s decision to make her antagonist a woman did not start with an intention to expand the conversation around sexual assault. When she first started toying with writing a novel four years ago, long before Harvey Weinstein was exposed, she began with the observation that it is rare to see a truly awful female antagonist. Someone who is “doing things without consequence and for no other reason than she just enjoyed them. For so many movies and books, if there is a female antagonist, they’re usually doing something to get back at someone. There has to be a redeemable quality, no matter how small. Even if it’s their prettiness.”Writing Any Man was cathartic. While Tamblyn says she has never been sexually assaulted “in any of the ways” in the book, she knows what it is like to be a victim of sexual violence. She has spoken openly, for example, about an ex-boyfriend who assaulted her at a nightclub in Hollywood, dragging her out of the venue “by my private parts”.Writing Any Man was also physically painful. “I had really severe carpal tunnel syndrome and De Quervain syndrome in both arms … if I typed for long periods of time, my arms would go numb. My hands would go numb, part of my cheek would go numb.” This was partly due to pregnancy and the repetitive strain of typing, but she thinks there was also a psychological element. “I think if Carl Jung were examining this, he would say that I was also possibly breaking out of some sort of a physical cast that I had been in my entire life. Perhaps it was actually my body attempting to feel for the first time.”Tamblyn started acting when she was 11. She grew up saying other people’s words and feeling other people’s feelings, being watched without truly being seen. “I think my experience growing up was one of long-term varied objectification,” she says. “All I’ve ever done is act. Even though there were so many other things swirling in my head.”She started getting that swirl on to paper a few years ago. In 2015, Tamblyn released a poetry collection called Dark Sparkler, about the lives and deaths of child actors. All of a sudden, she had physical ailments that “seemed to come out of nowhere”. But they did not really, she notes. “It has occurred to me that someone should do a study on artists who have to emote for a living and what that does to the central nervous system.”Of course, it is not just actors who emote for a living. Being a woman has traditionally meant demonstrating the right sort of emotions: smiling on demand, being polite, internalising your anger Lately, however, the anger has been uncorked. From Nasty Woman T-shirts to the #MeToo movement, women aren’t afraid of proclaiming how pissed off they are. How they are sick of having our bodies and emotions policed. That anger has bubbled up in pop culture. While reading Any Man, I was reminded of Dietland, a bestselling novel by Sarai Walker, recently turned into a TV show, which features a shadowy vigilante feminist group known only as “Jennifer” that murders predatory men.Tamblyn has not heard of Dietland and is careful to stress that Any Man is not a revenge fantasy. “Yes, there’s a lot of anger,” she says, but “I want to look past the anger at what is underneath it. And what is underneath it is a lack of empathy. When you don’t feel seen, you, of course, get furious, which I think is how a lot of women have felt for a long time.” Tamblyn carefully distinguishes sympathy from empathy. Sympathy, she says, is being able to rationalise why someone did something. Empathy, however, is “connecting with people on a larger whole, with who they are. Part of the huge disconnect within the #MeToo movement, for example – and it is very wild that this book was written so long before it – is that men can sympathise with women, but I don’t know that they empathise. They don’t know how to. This experience is really forcing men to empathise with the daily experience of womanhood.”Rape culture and gender inequality is not about men versus women, Tamblyn says. We all need to empathise more and interrogate our own complicity. “I think liberals do that. In this country, they do it too much, to the point where it harms them. And conservatives don’t do it at all. To the point where it harms them.”It would be hard to talk about complicity without mentioning Tamblyn’s husband, the comedian David Cross, who plays Tobias Fünke in the sitcom Arrested Development. In May, a New York Times interview with the cast of Arrested Development was held up as a disturbing demonstration of how complicity works. When the interviewer brought up accusations of sexual misconduct (which he denies) and harassment against the cast member Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walter (who plays Lucille Bluth) spoke tearfully about how Tambor had yelled at her on set. The male actors, including Cross, quickly rallied to Tambor’s defence, talking over Walter and minimising her experience.And, again, she says, that is really the point of Any Man: to show, not tell. To show the violence of objectification the physical and psychological violence of assault the violence of not being believed.“To find a way to get people who have been blind their whole lives to see. That is the work. That is the only way that things can change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9f4fe17aae8654f95d63020c8debbf8965cc89/0_377_7929_4759/master/7929.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6642a0a215b3c46f99764fd8654eac9","title":"anna jones cherry recipes","story":"You can’t beat cherries straight from a bag – unless you try this almond cherry cobbler and roasted cherry saladCherries are hands down my favourite fruit. During these summer weeks, I buy a bag most days. They’re almost always best eaten straight out of the bag, but there are a few recipes where cooked cherries rival fresh. One is this cherry cobbler, an intensely sweet-sour party between cherry and its best friend, almond. The other is a cherry salad, the fruit quickly pickled and roasted, popping against the salad leaves and buttermilk dressing.I make this in peak cherry season, when they are most affordable. At other times of the year, you could use some cheaper frozen cherries, or even some pitted and roughly chopped red plums in place of half the cherries.1kg cherries, pitted1 tbsp amaretto or frangelico (optional)Seeds from 1 vanilla pod or 1 tsp vanilla paste2-4 tbsp honeyZest of 1 unwaxed lemonFor the topping60g almonds, skin on125g white spelt flour1 tsp baking powder50g raw cane sugar or demerara sugar100g unsalted butter, chilled1 pinch flaky sea saltTo serveCreme fraiche, yoghurt or ice-creamHeat the oven to 240C465Fgas 9. First, make the topping. Blitz the almonds in a food processor until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, then add the flour, baking powder and sugar and pulse a couple of times to combine. Cut the butter into cubes and add to the food processor with the salt. Blitz again, until the mixture resembles rough breadcrumbs. Add a tablespoon of water and pulse again until it comes together into a firm dough.Put the cherries, liqueur (if using) and vanilla into a bowl and mix to combine. Grease a 20cm baking dish, and spoon in the cherries, to cover the bottom of the dish. Drizzle over the honey and use a tablespoon to dollop the dough on top, leaving gaps for the juices to bubble through.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the topping has risen and is a deep gold. Top with a few more toasted almonds, if you like, and serve with creme fraiche and a swirl of honey or some ice-cream.I use red-tipped little gems here, but butterhead, oakleaf, lollo rosso and frisée would also work. If you can’t find buttermilk, use yoghurt thinned with a splash of milk for the dressing. Some goat’s cheese or goat’s curd would be a nice addition, too.For the salad200g cherries, pitted and halvedA few sprigs thyme, leaves pickedZest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon2 tbsp red-wine vinegarOlive oilSalt and black pepper4 slices good bread4 little gem lettucesFor the dressing125ml buttermilk or thinned yoghurt (see note)1 tsp runny honey2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Lay the halved cherries on a baking tray, scatter with the thyme and grate over the lemon zest. Drizzle with the vinegar, then with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss the lot together and roast for 15-20 minutes.Tear the bread into chunks, put on another baking tray and season well. Drizzle generously with olive oil, then put in the oven for the last 15 minutes with the cherries. When time is up, the cherries should have darkened a little, their flavour intensified, and the bread should be crisp on the outside, chewy in the middle and deeply golden.To make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients in a jug, or shake in a tightly sealed jar, taste and season.Wash, dry and quarter the lettuces and scatter them on a plate. Once the cherries have cooled a little, scatter them over the lettuce and bread, and drizzle generously with the dressing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a938f49bd36c2732da79d0ba29d5e15d34c7b7/0_0_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8bbfe966b95b8652c9181899d63660","title":"sleep with as many women as i can lose girlfriend","story":"I know it’s selfish and that I might get caught, but I can’t help myself. The thrill of the chase is like an addictionI have a very nice and pretty girlfriend but I can’t help wanting to have sex with as many women as I can, even though I might get caught and lose her. It’s completely unfair on her and I fully realise this, but it’s the persuasion and the chase as much as anything. I’m middle-aged and the ladies tend to be in their early 30s. I’m orced with two youngish children. It’s selfish and I’m not sure it will make me happy in the long run, but it’s like an addiction. Is there anything to be done?You are not alone in having a high level of sexual desire, and there are people who would consider you very lucky. But while acting on your desires might be physically fulfilling in the short term, you seem to recognise that the choices you make could reduce your overall quality of life. Perhaps you are just not ready for monogamy if that is required by your girlfriend, you must decide whether you can comply or not. You were honest enough to mention being largely drawn to “the persuasion and the chase”, so it might be useful to consider what the real meaning of sex is for you beyond the erotic thrill itself. For some people, it is being validated as an attractive, socially adept, successful or sexually competent person, and a “conquest” is therefore affirming for those who lack confidence. For such people, the lure of this affirmation – especially from someone new – is very strong, and the pursuit of it can feel like an “addiction”. Try to improve your sense of self-worth in nonsexual ways. Hopefully you will be able to find new strategies to feel more secure as a man. Having strong sexual desire is a blessing, but, as you know, it presents many challenges. Misplaced, unchecked passion can spell social, career and familial disaster.

I have rented for years as I have always assumed that I would never be in a position to secure a mortgage on my salary which is currently just under £30,000. However, my family have recently been able to offer me help with a deposit – a gift, not a loan - and I am now considering my options. I have spoken with a mortgage adviser who believes I may qualify for a traditional mortgage but I have been looking at the London help-to-buy scheme and wondered if there was an advantage in applying for that, even if I have financial support.With personal savings and family assistance I can put forward a deposit of up to £50,000, with additional money reserved for legal fees.

One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way. Burt accused Rees-Mogg of being part of an “ideological clique” in a tweet after the article was published. “Just tired of this endless threat and counter-threat,” he wrote. “Why don’t we want the best for the UK than for our own ideological cliques? And there are others in this negotiation as far as I’m aware?”Duncan accused Rees-Mogg of “insolence” and said his “lecturing and threatening the PM is just too much”. He said the MP’s behaviour risked “debasing government, party, country and himself”.“The PM must be given maximum latitude and backing,” he tweeted. “The ideological right are a minority despite their noise and should pipe down.”Another minister, Richard Harrington, said his colleagues should “stop putting their own dogma above the good of the country and the party”.The junior business minister tweeted: “We should all support the prime minister and the businesses that employ so many people in good jobs and export so much.” Criticism also came from Tory backbenchers, including Sir Nicholas Soames, Simon Hoare and Sarah Wollaston, with Soames tweeting Rees-Mogg should “shut up” and “put a sock in it”.“Peel was also delivering freer trade and cheap bread which the growing industrial towns needed and demanded … Peel put country before party.”Hoare’s tweets drew further significant support from backbenchers. The Scottish Tory MP Paul Masterton tweeted “well said” and others retweeted the post, including Nick Boles, Nicky Morgan, Simon Hart, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach and the former Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer, one of the architects of the 2017 Tory manifesto.Wollaston, part of a contingent of soft-Brexit Tory MPs that has sometimes rebelled against the government, said the corn laws were “wrong then just as business-destroying hard Brexit would be wrong now … Trade with our closest neighbours needs to be frictionless and free.”Wollaston was one of the MPs depicted as “mutineers” on the front of the  before a vote on the EU withdrawal bill in parliament in December. She suggested there would be no similar treatment of pro-Brexit MPs who undermined the prime minister, saying they were “repeatedly threatening the PM unless she bends to their will”. “They should take note there is no parliamentary majority to just walk away and destroy business with a disastrous hard Brexit,” she tweeted.The Tory MP Vicky Ford, a former MEP, said the majority of MPs did not back Rees-Mogg’s stance. “If this becomes a binary choice between staying in the single market and customs union or no deal, then I do not believe there is a majority for no deal,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The Scottish Conservative Andrew Bowie, who is a member of the ERG, was also cautiously critical, tweeting: “My Conservative party are a commonsense, pragmatic, free trading, liberal party that governs and takes commonsense decisions in the national interest – not in the interests of an ideological clique ... on whatever side of an argument.”Richard Benyon, another backbencher, said: “I think we would all benefit from a period of silence from the ultras on both ends.”Downing Street would not comment on whether the prime minister believed Rees-Mogg was undermining her.

In May, Lucas said she would not stand again with the aim of “making space for other people”. Bartley announced he would instead stand with Berry. She is also a London councillor, in Camden, and is a member of the London assembly.Their competition for the members vote, which runs from 30 July to 31 August, will primarily come from Shahrar Ali, an academic and former deputy leader of the Greens, who is well known within the party.The final contender for the role, which covers the Greens in England and Wales, is Leslie Rowe, who stood as the party’s candidate in Richmond, Yorkshire, in 2005, 2010 and 2015.Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010, became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in 2012. Bennett endured a difficult 2015 general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over.When Lucas and Bartley were elected joint leaders there was some scepticism as to how such an arrangement might work, but the pair say it has proved a success. The Greens re-elect their leader, deputy leader and seven other senior posts every two years. Three other positions are elected on one-year terms. The results will be announced at the party’s annual conference in October.Among the five candidates for deputy leader are Amelia Womack, who has filled the role for four years, and Aimee Challenor, a 20-year-old activist from Coventry who is the Greens’ equality spokeswoman. If elected, she would be the first trans person to take such a role.The leadership candidates will take part in a series of hustings around the country during the voting process. All full members are eligible to vote, using a single transferable vote system.In comments released to coincide with the announcement, Lucas said she was “excited to see such a wide range of candidates” to build on the work she and Bartley have done.“Britain needs a strong Green voice now more than ever,” she said. “On issues from Brexit, to rising inequality and the government’s reckless attitude to our environmental protections and climate targets, Greens will always speak truth to power. “I will still be doing that in Parliament, and I look forward to seeing ever more Greens joining the national debate.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b01f90e26372208b813b401255186b1f0bee421c/0_0_4683_2810/master/4683.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b429f8c4bf6093c860630a309bf5a5","title":"uk latest brexit proposal is unrealistic say eu officials","story":"EU sources who have seen drafts of white paper say proposals would never be acceptedA draft of Theresa May’s Brexit plan has already been dismissed as unrealistic by senior EU officials, who say the UK has no chance of changing the European Union’s founding principles.The prime minister is gathering her squabbling ministers at Chequers on Friday for a one-day discussion to thrash out the UK’s future relationship with the EU. But EU sources who have seen drafts of the long-awaited British white paper said the proposals would never be accepted.May’s white paper is expected to propose the UK remaining indefinitely in a single market for goods after Brexit, to avoid the need for checks at the Irish border. While the UK is offering concessions on financial services, it wants restrictions on free movement of people – a long-standing no-go for the EU.Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the EU council’s legal service, said it would be impossible for the EU to split the “four freedoms” underpinning the bloc’s internal market, which are written into the 1957 treaty that founded the European project: free movement of goods, services, capital and people.“The EU is in difficulties at the moment the one and only success which glues all these countries together is a little bit the money and the internal market,” Piris said. “If you fudge the internal market by allowing a third state to choose what they want ... it is the beginning of the end.”Some sources expect the UK to abandon these plans. In an attempt to sweeten the pill they are prepared to offer an extra year of transition to smooth Britain’s EU exit.The British government believes the EU is guilty of its own cherry-picking, for example, by demanding the status quo on fishing quotas in exchange for zero tariffs on goods. Moreover, British officials think a single market in industrial goods is a win for the EU, which sells a surplus of manufactured products to the UK. Piris disagrees: “It is in their short-term economic interest, but it is a short-term myopic view, it is not what the leaders of the EU will do.”Responding to the latest EU views on the white paper, a UK government source said: “Rather than getting hot under the collar over unfounded media speculation, we’d suggest a better approach would be to wait for the white paper to be published before responding to it.”Theresa May is hoping for a warmer reception from EU countries. But Spain’s foreign minister has already said an “angry” France and Germany would reject these plans. “Germany will say no, France will say no, Spain will say no,” said Josep Borrell, who also described Brexit as “a pain in the ass”.At an EU summit on Friday, the EU’s 27 leaders, minus May, spent no more than 15 minutes discussing Brexit, while only three or four countries intervened. A terse statement issued by the leaders called on the UK to come up with “realistic and workable proposals”.This language was drafted in anticipation that “cake may be coming”, said another EU source, who described expectations of the Chequers meeting as modest.“The real problem is that if the result of Chequers is not unambiguous, the reality is that a lot of time, the summer, will be lost. And then you are really under a heavy time constraint,” said the source. “Yes, it increases the chances of a no-deal.”A spokesperson at the Department for Exiting the European Union referred back to remarks made by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, when the government announced the publication of the white paper.Describing the paper as “our most significant publication on the EU since the referendum”, Davis said: “It will communicate our ambition for the UK’s future relationship with the EU, in the context of our vision for the UK’s future role in the world.” He also said it would “include detailed, ambitious and precise explanations of our positions ... it should set out what will change and what will feel different outside the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3c11c420938c0095867778f89a58d9317150770/0_114_700_420/master/700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dded946a8cfacad12834ae90d0442e9","title":"first confirmed image of a newborn planet revealed pds70","story":"Nascent planet seen carving a path through the disc of gas and dust surrounding the very young star PDS70It is a moment of birth that has previously proved elusive, but astronomers say they now have the first confirmed image of the formation of a planet.The startling snapshot shows a bright blob – the nascent planet – travelling through the dust and gas surrounding a young star, known as PDS70, thought to be about 370 light years from Earth.The black circle in the centre of the image, to the left of the planet, is a filter to block the light from the star, enabling other features of the system to be seen.Captured by the Sphere instrument of the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, the planet – a gas giant with a mass greater than Jupiter – is about as far from its star as Uranus is from our sun, with further analyses revealing that it appears to have a cloudy atmosphere and a surface temperature of 1000C. “These discs around young stars are the birthplaces of planets, but so far only a handful of observations have detected hints of baby planets in them,” said Miriam Keppler of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, a lead author of the research published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. However, other ground-based observations have not yielded conclusive evidence.Young planets have also previously been identified using the orbiting Kepler telescope. But that method, said Keppler, also has limitations, relying on a dimming of the star’s light as a body moves in between it and the telescopeKeppler adds that the star around which the newly discovered planet orbits is just five to six million years old, noting that the planet could be even younger.Astronomers, she says, now have a big task ahead, carrying out observations to explore how the planet develops as well as tracing its orbit around the star, a journey thought to take about 120 years for the planet to complete.Dr Zoe Leinhardt, a computational astrophysicist specialising in planet formation at the University of Bristol and who was not involved in the research, welcomed the discovery.“This is a relatively young star that shows all of the indications that there should be a planet there, and there is one,” she said. “For astronomers, most of the time, it is very rare that we are really able to show a picture. We just have to make an interpretation,” she said. “This is almost undeniable, so it is very exciting. It does suggest that our idea for the way planet formation works is correct.”Leinhardt added that it is possible the planet has neighbours, or that other planets could appear over time. “The way that planets form, a large Jupiter-mass planet would be the easiest to see … and also those large planets would form more quickly,” she said. “What this does indicate is that planet formation is ongoing in that system.”Dr Dimitris Stamatellos, leader the of the theoretical star formation and exoplanets group at the University of Central Lancashire, was also enthusiastic. “This is an impressive discovery as this is maybe the first unambiguous direct observation of a planet that is caught while still forming within a young protoplanetary disc,” he said.But, he added, while the discovery has confirmed some theoretical predictions, it has also thrown up a conundrum. “It remains a mystery how such a massive planet can form at this unusual large distance from its parent star,” he said. “The standard planet formation theory has difficulty in explaining this planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6da4ab96aff27a8aa3e237cecad70bc9899978f5/0_74_7346_4407/master/7346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0495cf015f7fb2239e2c9b34ac85f3f","title":"scottish government plans restrictions on sugary and fatty foods to tackle obesity","story":"Ministers to tackle obesity by targeting sale, advertising and promotion of unhealthy foodsThe Scottish government is preparing for sweeping restrictions on sugary and fatty foods including ice-creams and takeaway meals to cope with surging rates of obesity.Ministers in Edinburgh outlined plans on Monday for strict restrictions on the sale, advertising and promotion of unhealthy foods that in some cases go further than proposals by health ministers in England.The plans, to be set out in detail this autumn, include:• Asking fast-food outlets, which sold nearly 950m meals in Scotland in 2015, to cut calories and portion sizes• Restricting sales of multi-buy offers for foods high in fat, sugar or salt• Consulting on restricting sales of energy drinks to under-16s• Outlawing free samples and the use of coupons for risky foods• Expanding the range of foods being targeted to include ice-cream and dairy-based desserts• Restricting displays of high-risk foods at checkouts and shopfront displaysThe Scottish government also backed demands from health campaigners for the UK government to outlaw television advertising of high-risk products before the 9pm watershed, to reduce children’s exposure.It also urged UK ministers to include sugary milk drinks in the statutory sugar limits if the industry did not voluntarily cut levels by 2020, and to use the tax system to make healthier foods cheaper.Its delivery plan said: “Relying solely on inidual action is not always sufficient. We are all susceptible to temptation, but children are especially impressionable. We need to make it easier for us all to make positive dietary choices.”The proposals were welcomed by health charities and Food Standards Scotland, the government safety agency. Retailers said they agreed a strategic approach was needed and would “engage constructively” with the new proposals.The Scottish Retail Consortium said ministers needed real evidence that blocking price promotions would reduce obesity without penalising shoppers, and that any labelling changes needed to be applied consistently across the UK.Pete Cheema, the chief executive of the Scottish Grocers’ Federation, said: “Given the condition of the high street and the number of shop closures, if the Scottish government were to consider introducing additional measures to that of the rest of the UK, this would place extra costs on to Scottish retailers and in particular convenience retailers who operate in a hypercompetitive retail grocery market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97256ef44e511b3e0ff230cf3b1b093cb75eb779/0_178_4789_2875/master/4789.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18e18929e4d267a2063dff92a20f677","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez democratic politics","story":"Less than a week after her stunning primary win, Ocasio-Cortez is told she’s too leftwing to win key midwestern votes. Not surprisingly, she disagreesIn April 2016, Bernie Sanders’ political revolution fizzled to a halt in New York. Hillary Clinton’s adopted home elevated her to within striking distance of the Democratic nomination. The loss was a devastating blow to Sanders’ progressive supporters.And yet that setback helped prepare the ground for one of this year’s most shocking political upsets.In a primary last Tuesday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old leftwing activist and Sanders organizer, defeated Joe Crowley, a 10-term House Democrat and potential contender for speaker, in an outer-borough New York district.“We’re in the middle of a movement in this country,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN after her win. “I feel this movement, but that movement is going to happen from the bottom up. That movement is going to come from voters.”Progressives hailed the win as proof of a growing grassroots movement.“Just like in 1916 when we saw the beginning of a progressive movement in response to the Gilded Age, I believe the Trump era is going to bring a progressive renaissance in this country,” said Ro Khanna, the only member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez – albeit in a dual recommendation with Crowley.Ocasio-Cortez, Khanna said, “is a harbinger of that new progressive movement”.And yet, for a Democratic party in search of a new identity in the Trump era, her victory has offered little immediate clarity.“When you knock off somebody like this, it’s very significant – and it doesn’t happen by accident,” said Jim Kessler of the centrist thinktank Third Way.But he added that Ocasio-Cortez’s win was less an endorsement of her leftwing ideology than a reflection of Democratic voters’ current preference for fresh faces and female candidates.On Sunday, the Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth suggested Ocasio-Cortez’s leftwing politics could alienate moderate midwestern voters.“I think that you can’t win the White House without the midwest,” Duckworth told CNN’s State of the Union. “And I don’t think that you can go too far to the left and still win the midwest.“Coming from a midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial midwest. You need to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide.”While it is true that in 2016 Sanders did not win the nationwide contest, he did beat Clinton in Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin, midwestern states which backed Obama but abandoned the Democrats for Trump. Two years later, in one of the most liberal enclaves in America, Ocasio-Cortez ran on a progressive platform that included several core policy issues proposed by Sanders.She pledged support for Medicare for All and tuition-free public college, backed a federal jobs-guarantee program and called for Congress to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).That earned her the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, a fact upon which Republicans have duly seized, claiming her win shows Democrats have moved too far to the left.On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez also appeared on the talk shows. On NBC’s Meet the Press, she was asked how she would “sell” her views to an older generation of Americans perhaps “afraid of the S-word”.“It’s part of what I am,” she said. “It’s not all of what I am. And I think that that’s a very important distinction. I’m an educator. I’m an organizer. And I believe that what we’re really seeing is just a movement for healthcare, housing and education in the United States.”Bill de Blasio agrees. The mayor of New York backed Crowley but in a statement issued after Ocasio-Cortez’s win, he said the Democratic party was “in a deep and fast process of change” and declared its future to be “decidedly progressive”.Until Tuesday, progressives had achieved only handful of notable electoral successes while suffering losses in Virginia, Ohio and Iowa. But there are other signs their message is resonating. A third of Senate Democrats, including many prospective 2020 candidates, and more than half of House Democrats support Sanders’ single-payer healthcare plan. Calls for minimum wage are widespread and many have adopted the anti-Wall Street rhetoric that was a trademark of Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign.In the House, Democrats must gain 23 seats if they are to retake the majority. As primary season nears the home stretch, the party has expressed confidence in a crop of contenders who have emerged in battleground districts.Speaking anonymously, an aide to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) argued that primary voters have largely unified around Democrats with the best chances of unseating Republicans. Twenty-seven of the party’s 29 “red to blue” candidates have won their races so far, the aide said – adding that many of those candidates track toward the center of the party, especially on healthcare and the economy.After Tuesday’s election, Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Ocasio-Cortez’s win was a reflection of the party’s “vitality” but was not indicative of a wider shift in its beliefs.“They made a choice in one district,” she said, adding that the fact 27,000 voters in a liberal district elected a more progressive candidate was “about that district” and “not to be viewed as something that stands for anything else”.“I think that there are a lot of districts in this country that are like New York 14,” she told NBC, “that have changed a lot in the last 20 years and whose representation has not.”Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran political consultant based in New York, said Crowley’s defeat should set off alarm bells for incumbents of either party.“The electorate is angry and both parties are in serious trouble,” he said. “The schism is huge and the coalitions are brittle. The difference is that the Republicans found one angry man to unite their anger.”Ocasio-Cortez said she felt such frustration knocking on doors in Queens and the Bronx. That sentiment, she told CNN, extended beyond “just one district”.After her win, she joined Sanders in endorsing Brent Welder, a labor lawyer and former Sanders delegate who is running in a Republican-held suburban Kansas City district that Clinton won narrowly. His August primary will likely be the next major test of the strength of the left.Like Ocasio-Cortez, Welder embraces single-payer healthcare and rejects corporate donations. Though his district is very far from New York, he is confident “progressive values” can resonate across demographic and geographic ides.“Her support in this race really helps us prove to the voters that this is the way to win and the way to achieve good progressive policy,” Welder told the .New York 14 is a safe Democratic seat. Next year, Ocasio-Cortez will almost certainly be in Washington. She has vowed to bring a “caucus” with her.“There’s a real hunger out there among voters for boldness and change agents,” said congressman Raul Grijalva, a co-chair of the House Progressive Caucus. “That’s what she presented and she won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a5e931d9d2eb16a0ba797628c5e45874b8e73a/0_224_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2da7e85ef940d6ffcfebb5ee925c273","title":"amlo mexico president five things","story":"Mexico’s new leader writes books, is friendly with Jeremy Corbyn, and has more in common with Lula than TrumpCritics deride Andrés Manuel López Obrador – or Amlo as most call him – as Mexico’s “tropical messiah”. Others have painted him as a Donald Trump-style Latin American populist with a big ego and a distinctly dictatorial bent. Even some supporters admit they fret about Amlo’s authoritarian tendencies and whether he is truly a man of the left.But most analysts believe Amlo has more in common with Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a pragmatic one-time union firebrand who led his country from 2002 until 2011. Like Amlo, Lula spent years trying to become president before succeeding at his fourth attempt.During his victory speech on Sunday night Amlo shed some light on how he plans to tackle perhaps the most urgent problem facing Mexico: the growing drug-related violence that this year has claimed an average of 88 lives per day. Amlo vowed to change the “failed strategy” his predecessors have used to tackle insecurity – a heavily militarized 11-year ‘war on drugs’ which has claimed 200,000 lives. On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbsp“More than the use of force, we will deal with the causes from which insecurity and violence originate,” Amlo said. “I am convinced that the most effective and humane way of fighting these ills involves combating inequality and poverty. Peace and tranquility are fruits of the justice.”Amlo isn’t just Mexico’s new president – he’s also a bookworm and author with no less than 14 titles to his name. His tomes include Don’t Say Goodbye to Hope, The Mafia That Took Possession of Mexico and The Mafia That Robbed Us of the Presidency about his first failed presidential bid, in 2006.The book was recently published in English with the title: A New Hope for Mexico: Saying No to Corruption, Violence, and Trump’s Wall.Amlo’s friends include an influential British leftist: the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, with whom he reportedly spent part of his 2016 Christmas holiday.The pair are said to have met through Corbyn’s Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez, a former human rights layer who now runs a fair-trade coffee business in the UK. Corbyn, who has longstanding ties to Latin America, has spoken out against human rights abuses in Mexico and last week denounced the killing of more than 130 Mexican politicians during the election campaign.Amlo reportedly once gifted Corbyn with a selection of jipi hats. “Jeremy loved them,” one member of Amlo’s campaign told the Times.Amlo’s political awakening is said to have come during the late 1970s when he worked as a representative of Mexico’s National Indigenous Institute in his native state of Tabasco.“He went to live in a shack just like the ones the indigenous families lived in,” José Agustín Ortiz Pinchetti recalls in a flattering new biography of his friend. During the six years he spent living with the Chontal Maya people, Amlo and his family slept in hammocks and endured “African temperatures of over 40C” with nothing but a single fan to keep them cool.“López Obrador took on that role as if it was his destiny, with a missionary’s spirit,” Pinchetti writes.

There’s a great vibe,” said Maira Quirino, 26 – who like many of those at the bar – is a single mother. The Seleção has so far had a successful if unspectacular World Cup. But away from the pitch, this tournament has thrown the spotlight on the player’s mothers whose hard-luck life stories appear to resonate with ordinary Brazilians in a way that the team’s more glamorous wives and girlfriends do not.According to a widely-shared story in the Brazilian edition of El País, six of the players who lined up against Serbia – Miranda, Thiago Silva, Marcelo, Casemiro, Paulinho and Gabriel Jesus – grew up without fathers. Many of Brazil’s great players have come from backgrounds of crushing poverty.And their mothers connect with ordinary Brazilian women because they have lived similar lives, said Debora Diniz, a professor of anthropology at the University of Brasília. That contrasts with the upscale lifestyle enjoyed by of players’ wives and girlfriends – who in many cases are lighter-skinned, unlike the team which is a typically Brazilian racial mix.In Brazil – and other South American countries – feminism is on the rise and the issues it raises are increasingly discussed on television soap operas, said Leticia Bahia, a consultant to the United Nations Foundation and co-founder of feminist site AzMina. “The idea that you have to stay in a marriage because of the children has really collapsed,” she said.At the Women’s Bar, Quirino’s friend Daiane Oliveira, 23 – who has the name of her daughter Camilly, 7, tattooed on her calf – said Brazilian mothers are increasingly choosing to go it alone if relationships aren’t working out. “Brazilian women today are independent. They don’t need men for anything.”A grimmer factor in Brazil’s growing number of single mothers is the country’s ban on abortion, which forces many women into unwanted pregnancies, said Thaiz Leão, 28, who runs a Facebook page called Mãe Solo (Single Mother) with 80,000 followers.“The father can abandon the child and the woman cannot,” Leão said. Brazil’s entrenched machismo is also a factor, she said: many men regard infidelity as their birthright and refuse to help at home. “We deserve better relationships,” Leão said.For many women, the spotlight on the team’s mothers has been been a timely reminder of where the players came from. “None of them are middle class,” said Mariluce Souza, 36, who runs the Favela Art project in the Complexo do Alemão.Vera Lúcia, mother of Manchester City and Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus, is a former maid who raised him and his three brothers alone. Now, however, she often appears on chat shows and toured Russia – alongside Neymar’s mother Nadine and Fernandinho’s mother Ane – for a six-part TV Globo series called As Matrioskas – The Russian Dolls. Her strong, supportive relationship with her 21-year-old son, a star at Manchester City, resonated with mothers in the crowd at the Women’s Bar.“Gabriel Jesus is from a favela and was raised by his mother,” says Rita de Cassia, 38, a single mother of three children – the middle of whom, Andry, 12, also dreams of becoming a footballer. Brazil’s World Cup focus on footballing sons and mothers from tough neighbourhoods was encapsulated in a photograph which went viral earlier this monthWallace Rocha, 12, from Rio’s Vila Cruzeiro favela wanted a shirt with midfielder Philippe Coutinho’s name, but neither his mother, Sandra de Oliveira, 47, an unemployed cleaner, nor his stepfather could afford one. De Oliveira asked a local seamstress to knock one up, promising to pay later. Photographer Bruno Itan captured the pair watching Brazil beat Costa Rica photo – then launched an online campaign to get it to Coutinho.The photo went viral and four hours later, Coutinho replied with a video message.Wallace too wants to become a footballer, his mother said. “It’s my dream too,” she said. “It’s a good profession for him, to get him off the streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b3025b2b76b0e67586ff22acb1761b05061c3c3/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e176b2332bd4d882a8e0e2a6e687503","title":"amlo wins mexico election in pictures","story":"Supporters of the Juntos Haremos Historia (Together We Will Make History) presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, – fill Zócalo square in central Mexico City to celebrate his dramatic election victory.

A reader called Chris contacted us in connection with Irish Ferries. Towards the end of April he wanted to bring his father-in-law from Castlebar to Todmorden in England. The man is “an elderly MS patient who has recently suffered a second debilitating stroke”. He is originally from the UK and has been in Ireland for 12 years. He needed to ensure that the journey ran smoothly. After picking his father-in-law up from the nursing home in Castlebar they made good time on the motorway and arrived promptly for the Dublin Swift sailing leaving at 2.30pm. “We checked in as normal and were directed to the entrance of the vessel. On arrival at the ramp we were asked to pull over to one side. After a good while it became apparent that there may be a problem. After another while I got out of our vehicle to try to clarify what was happening as a stream of other vehicles was being let on.” Chris stressed a number of times to the staff the urgency of the situation and that they had a strict schedule to adhere to “and that as a matter of priority we needed to travel on the sailing we were booked on. We were told that that would not be possible and that we would have to travel on a later craft.”Then Irish Ferries staff said the party could travel on a Stena Line ferry that was due to arrive later on that evening in Holyhead. “Faced with no other option we returned to check-in where we were directed onto the Stena Line ferry. This vessel didn’t arrive in Dublin until much later that evening which meant that our scheduled arrival in Todmorden around dinner time would now be approaching midnight. “This journey was a lot longer than we anticipated and a lot longer than we had planned for. This was not only deeply stressful but necessitated making contingent plans at the nursing home we were travelling to which had been informed days previously of our travel plans and had allocated staff especially to deal our situation,” he says. He adds that all the stresses of the family “were exacerbated by the fact that we hadn’t anticipated and were never informed that we may not be able to travel on a newly refurbished vessel that had only been in operation with Irish Ferries for a short while.” She said the company immediately sought to put alternative arrangements in place and booked him on the next sailing out of Dublin. “We fully understand that this caused inconvenience as the Irish Ferries Dublin Swift was due in Holyhead at 16.30, while the Stena ferry was not due to arrive til 18.20 and was, we believe, further delayed.” She said the company recognised “that the events on the day caused problems. As well as arranging alternative travel with Stena free of charge, we refunded Mr Leach’s meals, upgraded his return journey, offered a €100 voucher and a further free trip on Dublin Swift. We would like to apologise once again for the inconvenience and to assure our customer of our best efforts to provide a smooth journey on his next trip.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547008.1530195823!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sky s the limit customer foiled as he tries to cancel broadband contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRepeated calls to Sky failed to produce the desired response for the frustrated customer. Photograph: David JonesPAA reader named Paul Davy got in touch because he wanted us to know about what he called Sky’s Hotel California policy, a policy which, he says, means “you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave”.He has spent much of the past 12 months trying to cancel his Sky broadband account to no avail so far and in his mail he promises a “quick” version of the story but – to be honest – it is not at all quick so you might want to settle in.“I was approached by an eir salesman in May 2017 as they were installing fibre in our remote area of Co Galway and he advised that if we didn’t sign up with eir we’d be waiting more than two years for Sky fibre,” his story starts.Davy says he found the salesman “a bit pushy”, and having had Sky TV for eight years and its broadband for around three years “albeit with miserable download speeds” he decided to contact\u0026nbspSky before he signed with eir.He did that on May 25th last year “and they confirmed I was out of contract but also advised that if my neighbours were getting fibre from eir then there was no reason that Sky couldn’t provide me with fibre – more or less rubbishing what the eir salesman had told me,” he says.So he renewed his contract with Sky “on the clear understanding that what they were telling me was correct”, he says.“I can still hear myself spelling that out as a condition of renewal and Sky reconfirming that if my neighbours have fibre I’ll have fibre through Sky. I was even willing to wait one or two months for the fibre.”He never got his fibre. He called Sky “a few times” over the next few months, each time giving them a history of events, and each time he says he was given conflicting information.Last September a Sky agent confirmed the company couldn’t provide fibre in his\u0026nbsparea “as eir had pulled in new lines to my neighbours and hadn’t released them yet to other providers. As I was running a home office on still miserable download\u0026nbspspeeds I cancelled Sky broadband and phone that day”, Davy says.He was, however, persuaded to keep the TV package with the promise of a discount. Then he signed up for eir fibre and phone and the Sky agent confirmed that he would send the cancellation request to the relevant department.He got his eir fibre installed a few days later “without any hassle”, and all was well. Then he realised Sky were still taking the full amount of direct debit out of his account when they should have only be charging him for his discounted TV package.He contacted Sky again on October 6th. An agent confirmed his cancellation had not been processed but she said she would contact the Cancellation Department and ring him back that day. The agent did not call back that day but he missed a call from her the following day “and she left a message to say she’d call me the following Wednesday – four days later”.The call came as promised. The agent said there would be an early disconnection charge as I was cancelling “in contract”. Davy disputed this and asked for transcripts of his calls with Sky to prove his case.“The forms I was supposed to sign requesting the transcripts never arrived and I let it slip for a while as I was very busy in work and didn’t have time during the day to be still following this up,” he says.Then in early January “with full direct debits still going out to Sky” he spoke to another agent and went through the story again.Time passed and he contacted Sky again as the transcript request form wanted him to submit £10 (sterling) when returning it. The company confirmed they’d sent out the wrong form and that he shouldn’t have to pay anything and that they would send out a new transcript form in the post.“I finally got the transcripts in the post toward the end of February 2018 but it came in the form of 40 pages of every transaction and call in Excel format, a hard copy of emails sent to me and a CD Rom – hello – who still has a CD player on their laptop in this day and age? I mean Sky can reboot your TV from India so you think they could email me the call recordings? I also had to call Sky again as the form requested €5 this time – I was told that I was misinformed and that there was a €5 fee but if I paid it that Sky would credit me for same.”Again Davy let it slip for a spell as he was very busy in work “and needed to source an old laptopPC with a CD player. But when I finally did source one last weekend, the security ‘passphrase’ they emailed me separately to open the CD did not work. I’ll be contacting them yet again today advising of same, but either way I know I renewed in good faith on the basis that Sky could offer me fibre like eir.”Apart from the efforts to get the transcripts he has also contacted Sky on numerous occasions to cancel his broadband and having been as polite as humanly possible all along, “on one occasion I finally lost it a little when pitted against an alpha male supervisor who had raised the tone of our conversation to a higher level, when I uttered the words \u0027get your head out of your ass for a minute\u0027\u0026nbspit was duly followed by \u0027I’m now terminating this call\u0027. I mean I work in construction and that’s about the least vulgar thing you can say to someone in conversation,” he says.“On another occasion I was told I could only cancel Sky exactly a month before the renewal date and not before. So I did ring Sky on 25th April 2018, someone in the Cancellation Department listened to my summary of the whole fiasco and confirmed that she’d process the cancellation herself, do a follow-up on the 14th May 2018 to make sure it went through and also confirmed when I asked the question that \u0027nothing can go wrong\u0027\u0026nbspwith it this time”.“He did call back 10 minutes later and promised to sort things out within the Cancellation Department and call me back later that day. I haven’t heard anything from anyone in Sky since and am beginning to think that this is some kind of sick game that the Sky Cancellation Department play on people or maybe it’s just with me.”He says what he would like is the cancellation of his broadband, a refund of his money, and “an official apology from Sky to acknowledge that you can’t treat people like this and you can’t continually give them misinformation depending on what operator they’re talking to”.He also said he would like “compensation for the wasted hours on the phone where you’ve got to psych yourself up to make the call in the first place, go through their voice recorded options, utter the words “Cancel Broadband” for the umpteenth time when they ask you to clearly describe how they can help you today, relay your life story to another poor unfortunate Sky operator who you know sympathises with you but are only doing their job and probably have another 10 or 20 Paul Davys to listen to after your call finishes”.We got in touch with the company and received the following statement.“Having investigated the case highlighted we wish to apologise to the affected customer. We pride ourselves on providing customers with a high standard of customer service and acknowledge that the customer’s experience in this instance did not meet those standards. We have reached out to the customer and have resolved this matter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality   June 30, 2018LGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protest   July 2, 2018None more gloriously cynical about creeping commercialisation than LGBT+ community "},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s hosepipe ban everything you need to know","story":"Irish Water have introduced a hosepipe ban in the Greater Dublin Region. What does that mean? What is covered? How long will it last? And how will it be enforced?The month-long ban was introduced on Monday, to last until at least July 31st, at which point it may be extended.The ban prohibits people using their garden hose, with a few minor exceptions. People will not be allowed to use a hosepipe to water their garden or potted plants, wash their car or boat, or fill a paddling pool, pond, or water fountain.People can still water their garden and plants using a watering can, and fill a paddling pool with buckets of water filled from the tap. The hosepipe ban on filling ponds does not apply if there is fish in the garden pond. The ban is in place 247 for the next month.At the moment the hosepipe ban is only in place across the wider Dublin region. Irish Water has included as parts of counties Wicklow and Kildare in the Greater Dublin Region area ban.It said there are more than 100 other areas across the country at risk of water shortages, where it is considering a hosepipe ban to conserve supply.Decisions to extend the ban to other areas are likely, but will be considered on a scheme by scheme basis. In the meantime night time water restrictions are in place across several parts of the country, to help conserve supply.In the south of the country 27 local water schemes have been severely affected by drought, including parts of Kilkenny, Carlow, Waterford, Limerick and Kerry.People can report their neighbours or anyone they see breaking the ban. A tip line to report excessive water use is available at 1850 278 278.The water utility said they have added additional staff to man the phone line over the next month. The phone line can also be used to ask staff general water conservation queries.A spokeswoman from Irish Water said staff would follow up on reports, and take actions where they found “excessive and continuous usage” of water.If Irish Water deem someone has committed an offence in breaching the conservation order, they can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they do not pay within 21 days.Legislation allowing Irish Water to introduce a hosepipe ban is covered under the Water Services Act 2000, which gives the utility the power in cases of “serious deficiency” of water supply.Irish Water have introduced the restrictions in Dublin as demand for water is outstripping how much the utility can supply.The greater Dublin water schemes can produce 610 million litres of treated water a day. Currently nearly all of that is being used, since the heatwave started.This is compared to an average 565m litres a day used over the summer last year.During the peak of the heatwave in the second half of last week, up to 615m litres a day was being drawn down in Dublin.The exceptionally high temperatures over the last week have also led to dropping water levels in lakes and rivers, and the dry weather has also meant a lack of rain.Water reserves are being stretched to the limit, with the Pollaphuca reservoir on the Liffey being drained so quickly it may have knock on effects for water supply later in the summer, and even into the autumn, Irish Water have said.At the moment the conservation order is in place for the month on July. A spokeswoman for Irish Water said they will “continue to monitor all water supplies and will provide updates if any extension is required.”“We have a collective community responsibility for the conservation of water, as they do in other countries when a hosepipe ban is in place,” the spokeswoman said.Irish Water have also called on people to take steps to conserve the amount of water they use generally.People are being asked to take showers instead of baths, and to take shorter showers. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, and only run the dishwasher and washing machine on full loads.If watering your plants with a watering can, Irish Water said people should do so in the early morning or evening, to limit evaporation.When it comes to flushing the toilet, Irish Water’s conservation advice is to “let the yellow mellow,” as flushing the toilet is one of the biggest uses of water in the household. People are being asked to “consider only flushing the toilet when you really need to,” the utility have said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3551298.1530552830!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water says too early to say if hosepipe ban being heeded","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe hosepipe ban may be extended to other parts of the country in the coming days. Photograph: Tom Honan. Jack Power, Tim O’Brien and David RaleighIt is too soon to say if homeowners in Dublin are reporting their neighbours for flouting the hosepipe ban, according to Irish Water. Under current regulations those who are found to have been using a hosepipe to water gardens, fill paddling pools or wash cars can be subject to a fine of €125 - but Irish Water said it does not want to see that happen. The authority stressed it would prefer people to educate themselves to the necessity for the hosepipe bans - which it said were likely to be extended to several other parts of the country in the coming days. The utility has said it will accommodate any farmer who is impacted by reduced water supply from public water sources but hose pipe bans were necessary due to the uncharacteristically long dry spell and forecast drought or near -drought conditions. The Greater Dublin Region hose pipe ban was introduced on Monday, to last until at least July 31st. In the coming days the ban will be extended to parts of Kilkenny, Laois and Limerick, due to water shortages, according to Irish Water managing director Jerry Grant. Over the next week the ban is “likely to extend” further again, Mr Grant said, on RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland programme. The ban prohibits people using their garden hose, with a few minor exceptions. People will not be allowed to use a hosepipe to water their garden or potted plants, wash their car or boat, or fill a paddling pool, pond, or water fountain.People can still water their garden and plants using a watering can, and fill a paddling pool with buckets of water filled from the tap. The hosepipe ban on filling ponds does not apply if there is fish in the garden pond. The ban is in place 247 for the next month. “We are in a crisis situation now,” Mr Grant said, due to water usage outstripping supply. “We are working at the edge of what we can do,” he said. Tankers of water are being moved from larger water schemes, to smaller under pressure schemes across the country, to maintain an even supply, he said. Amid the shortage, the Lord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring has said his official car will not be washed while the hosepipe ban is in place. Dublin Bus is also reducing the amount of times its bus fleet is washed. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe urged all water users to make sure they conserve water and use water responsibility. “Obviously we’d all prefer that enforcement measures were not needed, but I think in circumstances, where Irish Water discover that some water users are using water in such a way that they’d be depriving us all of the use of water across the coming days and beyond, then I think it’s up to Irish Water to take appropriate action,” he said in Limerick. The Minister said the Government was listening to farmers on the fodder crisis and any concerns they had over the drought.“The Government have already convened a fodder group…to consider what kind of advice can be made available and what we can do. We are aware of the anxiety and worry that farmers are facing at the moment. We are encouraging them to use feed supplement where they can, to take the place of precious grass that is rapidly depleting in front of us,” he said. “I’ll listen to what the farmers have to say and see if there are any ideas and views we can bring to government.” IFA President Joe Healy said the crisis was “a once-in-a-generation weather event which is posing really difficult challenges for some farmers.” He said any farmer who was short of water for livestock shoudl contact Irish Water which he said had undertaken to respond to their needs. Mr Healy said in the medium term soil moisture and high temperatures were impacting on grass growth rates. He said “the worry now is how quickly growth will resume and whether farmers will be able to save enough silage and hay for the winter ahead, particularly as reserves were well depleted during the extended poor weather conditions earlier this year.” Mr Healy has urged farmers to to take note of Teagasc advice for feeding in the drought conditions.

Photograph: David YoungPA WireNorthern Ireland Water has said a hosepipe ban will continue until there is enough treated water to meet demand.The ban limiting domestic water use, which began last Friday, is continuing despite NIW seeing a “slowly improving picture”.Water treatment works have been operating at near maximum levels, with more than 700 million litres of water per day being put into the network, more than 30 per cent higher than usual. On Monday, an NIW spokeswoman said staff were “monitoring the situation continuously”.“We do not want the ban to continue any longer than is necessary. However, the ban will not be lifted until we are confident there is enough treated water to meet the required water demands,” she said.Over the weekend homes in Belfast, Lurgan and Coalisland experienced a loss of pressure and intermittent supply failure. “Currently there is no one specific area affected by water supply issues,” an NIW spokeswoman said. “However, if people continue to use water at the current rate, the loss of supply could become a reality anywhere.“Unnecessary use of water – ie washing cars, watering lawns etc – is putting the water supply of your own household and that of your neighbours at risk.”NIW has “plenty of untreated water” from previous rainfall stored in natural loughs and behind dams. The problem is “the sheer amount of water people are using at the tap”, she said.The Ulster Farmers’ Union is calling on the public to support the calls to reduce water consumption. Its president, Ivor Ferguson, said: “As this prolonged spell of hot weather continues, it’s essential that all farm animals have an adequate supply of water. Even a temporary shortage would have a devastating effect on animal welfare.” The last hosepipe ban in Northern Ireland was in 1995. The Met Office has said Northern Ireland experienced its warmest June since records began in 1910."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550851.1530515670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"downing street produces third brexit customs model report","story":"Downing Street has produced a third model for handling for post-Brexit customs ahead of crucial Cabinet talks on Friday, according to reports.British prime minister Theresa May will bring together her Cabinet at Chequers on Friday to thrash out details of a white paper setting out the UK’s plans for areas such as trade.Brexiteers oppose the Ms May’s favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.Their “max fac” alternative would, rather than scrapping customs checks, uses technology to minimise the need for them.Both options have been dismissed by the EU. According to the BBC, No 10 has now produced a third model for handling customs after Brexit which will be discussed by senior ministers at the prime minister’s country residence.Prior to the report, communities secretary James Brokenshire said there was “no doubt that there is strong views on either side” over Brexit in Cabinet, but insisted he was “confident” Ms May’s top team could reach an agreement at the meeting.Mr Brokenshire said the UK government was planning for “all eventualities”.Meanwhile, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Ms May must deliver the Brexit she promised or risk collapsing the government.Mr Rees-Mogg said Ms May and her top team must decide at Chequers if they would stand by her pledges or reduce “a once-proud country” to a “tremulous state that sees Brexit as mere damage limitation”.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg warned Ms May she was in danger of splitting the party like Sir Robert Peel, who plunged it into the political wilderness for nearly three decades following bitter isions over trade reforms.He said: “Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised.“One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way.“This left the Conservatives out of office for 28 years.It comes as Ms May’s chief Brexit official reportedly told ministers they have no chance of striking a bespoke trade deal with Brussels. Briefing Cabinet ministers ahead of the Chequers talks, Oliver Robbins is said to have painted a bleak picture of the situation, with a source telling the Times they came out of the meeting thinking “we were even more screwed than we were before”.Business secretary Greg Clark and commons leader Andrea Leadsom both refused to rule out an extension to transition arrangements in the face of demands from Tory backbenchers for the timetable to be maintained.Mr Clark said the decision must be “guided by the facts and the evidence” and Mrs Leadsom said December 2020 was not a “magical date”.–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550368.1530470887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s business secretary holds out prospect of longer brexit transition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State for Business Greg Clark. Photograph: Will OliverEPABritain’s post-Brexit transition arrangement with the European Union could extend beyond its scheduled limit of December 2020, one of Theresa May’s most senior ministers has suggested. Business secretary Greg Clark said during a visit to the port of Dover that evidence should dictate when Britain moves away from the status quo in terms of alignment with the EU.“At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run this very successful port ... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don’t have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place,” he told Sky News.“Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. What we need to assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice, and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.”The cabinet will meet next Friday at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers, ahead of the publication next week of a white paper outlining the future relationship Britain wants with the EU. More than 30 Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers have written to Ms May telling her to show “courage and leadership” and to stand firm against calls to compromise with the EU.“Our departure must be absolute,” the letter states. “We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation. Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”Housing secretary James Brokenshire said on Sunday that he was confident that ministers would unite around a common position at Friday’s meeting. And Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said that cabinet disunity could lead to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. “The danger of disunity at the top of the party is not just that it makes the prime minister’s job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach,” Mr Brady wrote in the Observer. “It also gives an impression of ision to the country. Electorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for ided parties. They rejected decisively the ided Tory party in 1997. If we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.”Mr Corbyn is under pressure from anti-Brexit groups in his party to back calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, as a poll showed most members of the Unite union wanted a second vote. Members of Momentum, the grass-roots group that backs Mr Corbyn’s leadership, have also called for a fresh referendum but the Labour leader on Sunday resisted the demand.“We have not proposed it, we have not supported it and we are not proposing it now,” he told Sky News.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Indeed, Mexicans joke that “AMLO”, as he\u0027s known, mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005 and a household name, has been campaigning for the presidency for 18 years.Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Mexico\u0026#039s Jeremy Corbyn to battle \u0026#039the mafia of power\u0026#039“It’s a triumph for all the world, all the people,” he told his fans, gathered outside his home in the early hours of Monday. “It’s of millions and millions who are fed up with this regime of corruption and privilege, and who decided today to vote for a real change.“I’m going to do it. I won’t fail you.”Jose Antonio Meade, 49, candidate for the ruling PRI, conceded defeat with lightning speed, announcing shortly after the first exit polls were given, at 8pm in Mexico City, that he had lost.An experienced and well-respected politician, he was severely handicapped by representing the party of despised President Enrique Pena Nieto.Jose Antonio Meade gives a thumbs up after voting on Sunday. He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policyQueen bounces back from illness that saw her cancel St Paul\u0026#39s Cathedral engagementBoris Johnson backs Jacob Rees-Mogg after he warned Theresa May she faces Tory revolt over BrexitHarvey Weinstein facing new sex crime charges Millennials don\u0026#39t know they have to pay interest on credit card repayments, expert warnsSir Ranulph Fiennes accuses judge of showing leniency to hunt attackers after Princess Diana\u0026#39s sister pleads for clemency From extending tenancy periods to inheritance tax, readers react to today\u0026#39s top stories   Twelve children and their football coach found alive after going missing in Thai cave more than a week agoComment: Left-wing hysteria over period poverty means we\u0026#39re ignoring the women who really need helpFatal tank explosion may have been caused by soldiers \u0026#39showing off\u0026#39 to colleagueHero dog suffers swollen snout after saving owner from rattlesnake biteLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowMPs should quit social media to protect their mental health, says the parliamentary health watchdogTheresa May faces Cabinet backlash over Brexit \u0026#39third way\u0026#39 and \u0026#39treating ministers like idiots\u0026#39Six coffees a day could save your life   Comment: Mexico\u0026#39s new president will need a border showdown just as much as Donald TrumpIran diplomat among four arrested over \u0026#39plot to attack\u0026#39 opposition meeting in France attended by  Rudy GiulianiIreland aims to be \u0026#39vocal, active and courageous\u0026#39 on world stage as it seeks United Nations Security Council seat EU opens new legal case against Poland for \u0026#39undermining judicial independence\u0026#39 with Supreme Court overhaulWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg","title":"brexit two years deal uk economy effects city london ashoka mody international monetary fund","story":"Created with Sketch.The message of the Brexit vote - and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since - was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitmentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit is a done deal - but the social and economic wounds that led to it have not been healedAt the two-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.“The list invites us to reflect again on the asymmetry of our attitudes toward\u0026nbspNazism and communism,” wrote Garton Ash, whose own experiences of being spied on by the communist East German Stasi informed his book The File. \u0026nbspWhat if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is a good couple of weeks now and we are looking at potentially two\u0026nbspor three\u0026nbspmore weeks of a prolonged settled spell.“This week will be a bit of a repeat of last week with lots of hot, dry, sunny weather for pretty much the whole of the UK.”Temperatures are set to reach highs of 30C across the south and\u0026nbspSouth West with warm or hot temperatures across the rest of the country too.Apart from the heat, some thunderstorms are expected in the Channel Islands and possibly parts of the South West on Monday, following on from some downpours that provided a break from the heat on Sunday.Just the odd rain shower has been forecast throughout the month, primarily in the South West.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Six days after the action Sq Ldr Duncan was again in the thick of it, leading a wave of Chinook helicopters delivering paratroopers under enemy fire at night.On that occasion an RPG flew under the cockpit and exploded 3ft away, causing him to instinctively lift his feet in the air off the controls.Sq Ldr Duncan, the son of a French mother and a Scottish father, grew up in Paris before moving to England in 1995.After graduating from Manchester University he was commissioned into the Royal Air Force in 2000 and carried out his six months officer training at RAF Cranwell, Lincs, passing out as a Flying Officer in February 2001.In total, Sq Ldr Duncan undertook five tours of Afghanistan between 2006 and 2011, amassing over 2,000 hours in the Chinooks.His has since written the critically-acclaimed book called \u0027Sweating the Metal\u0027, detailing his hair-raising experiences in Afghanistan.Sq Ldr is now in charge of the Oxford University Air Squadron.BNPSThe damage done to the aircraft was clearly visibleMark Quayle, specialist at London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb which is selling the meals, said: Chinook crews are too often the unsung heroes of high-intensity 21st century warfare.These huge helicopters - laconically referred to as \u0027cabs\u0027 by those who fly them - present obvious targets for enemies armed with rocket propelled grenades such as the Taliban in Afghanistan.But despite their vulnerability, pilots like Alex Duncan have repeatedly flown Chinooks into the heart of fierce fighting to land or extract troops, pick up casualties and resupply bases.Duncan\u0027s dramatic account of how he and his crew narrowly survived some of the most dangerous missions of the Afghanistan war is gripping.His Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Force Cross - a rare combination of awards for the Afghanistan conflict - were hard-earned.They represent recognition of the vital role that Chinook crews play at immense personal risk.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody because we have this voluntary agreement with food manufacturers. Everythings stacked against the consumer who is trying to maintain their weight.Our investigation discovered carbohydrates in a strawberry and banana Innocent Smoothie were 210 per cent higher than on the packaging in one test with sugars down 47 per cent.Instead of the reported two grammes of carbohydrates per 100ml in a 750ml smoothie and 11g of sugars the test showed there were actually 6.2g of carbs and 5.8g of sugars.The results mean the drink brand would have fallen foul of regulations set up to control food nutritional labelling.Quorn sausages would have been in breach of the law with tests finding carbohydrates almost 40 per cent higher than its food label.They showed the vegetarian meat had 14.8g of carbohydrates per 100g, of which 1.2g was sugars, instead of the labelled 10.6g with 1.5g of sugars.And in a tested 500g pack of Kelloggs Special K Red Berries sugars were up 8.2 per cent while carbs leaped 6.6 per cent to 66.1g per 100g - an extra 20g per pack though within the legal limits.Based on Kelloggs own serving portions this equates to an extra bowl of carbs per 500g pack.Two Weight Watchers ready meal products - which boast their nutritional value on the front of their packages - showed large rises in calories, carbs and sugars.Tests on a Spicy Jerk Chicken and Rice meal found calories up 10 per cent while carbs had a leap of 17.3 per cent -  just under the regulations 20 per cent threshold.And an Aromatic Chicken Tikka meal showed calories up 5 per cent and carbohydrates 11 per cent higher than the packaging.Both products had large percentage rises in sugar content - up 52.6 per cent and 44.4 per cent from a reported 1.9g and 1.8g per 100g.Other products which showed rises include a Waitrose Charlie Bighams ready meal which had a 128 per cent jump in sugar to 1.6g per 100g.Carbohydrates in the £8 Beef Stroganoff dish were also up 9.2 per cent to 14.2g in the tests carried out at one of the UKs few remaining public health laboratories in Lancashire.We also tested Muller fruit corner yoghurts which showed they were able to accurately report their nutritional values.Leading health experts have called for more testing of nutritional value in food and tighter controls on companies following our probe.Labour MP Kerry McCarthy, of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said: There is so much misrepresentation in food packaging and this needs further investigation.People ought to have the information they need on packaging at the starting point to make informed choices. These are quite wide tolerance levels anyway. Packaging is just quite misleading in general.Professor Graham MacGregor, a cardiovascular medicine expert of Queen Mary University in London, said: What your results are suggesting is there may be a tendency to under-report whats in the food in some products and I think thats deeply worrying.Firstly its misinforming the public about whats in the foods theyre eating which is obviously wrong.And if its above certain levels or below its actually reportable under EU law.Asked about the Weight Watchers ready meal results, Professor MacGregor replied: Its deeply worrying if its across the board for Weight Watchers then that is serious because clearly youd expect Weight Watchers to get the calorie and sugar levels correct because thats what theyre claiming is their main forte.It needs further investigation but it is deeply worrying.Professor Spector added: Our twin studies have shown if you give the same diet to two different people they will respond differently - diet and calories dont have averages and need to be looked at on a much more individual basis.In the future everyone will probably be tested and personalised nutrition will replace this nonsense on the label.I am leading a new study called Predict to see which foods, ignoring calories, are right for your body based on your gut microbes.There should be more checks but the government doesnt care as long as food is cheap. And for diet products there is no excuse.Food nutritional labelling is governed by EU regulation and enforced by Trading Standards officers.The mandatory rules state that for carbohydrates and sugars products have to be within two grammes under 10g per 100g, within 20 per cent from 10g to 40g and within 8g thereafter.A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: “The public have a right to know what’s in the food they’re eating and there are clear rules on how products should be labelled.Trading Standards have the power to take action against anyone breaking the rules.”A Quorn spokeswoman said: We are surprised by the reported findings as we regularly test our products using an independent lab to ensure our products reflect the nutritional labelling on pack, and this data does not match that of the independent lab.The EU levels have always been set at 20 per cent variance and this is a figure Quorn complies with across the entire range.Trading Standards officers thanked The Sun for bringing the matter to their attention and have vowed to investigate further.Innocent said their own tests would show more sugars present in their smoothie drink while a Weight Watchers spokeswoman said their variations were within legal tolerances.Bighams and Kelloggs had failed to respond at the time of publication.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The report was authored by a senior doctor, Consultant Neurologist Dr Paul Goldsmith.Dr Goldsmith said: “The NHS is full of incredibly bright, talented and dedicated people with lots of excellent ideas and initiatives, but is really poor at scaling and spreading innovation”.The Centre for Policy Studies Director Robert Colvile added: “If we care about the NHS, we need to ensure that money is spent wisely, and that good staff are rewarded for good work”.Other fresh research today also reveals the NHS is lagging behind other European health services on survival rates and waiting times.If UK cancer patients were treated in Germany rather than here, more than 12,000 lives more would be saved each year, the Institute of Economic Affairs said.The IEA’s Kate Andrews said: “If policymakers are serious about improving patient care in this country, they should stop pouring money into a broken system, and instead look to the Social Health Insurance systems in Europe”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or what they coyly refer to as novel weapon technology.“And the files reveal they were desperate to capture this technology - wherever it came from - before the Russians or the Chinese got hold of it first.“Although this was 1997, Russia was still regarded as undefeated enemy with a weapons programme regarded as a threat to the West.”Alien experts claim there have been more than 100,000 recorded UFO sightings worldwide in the past 100-plus years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000276899927.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit negotiator trade deal jacob rees mogg","story":"Oliver Robbins -

Parents need to list the activities they do when away.“When you come back for the second week, [the children are] going to present to your peers what youve done, what youve learned.”He said he was inspired to come up with the policy as 40 per cent of his students are on pupil premiums which sees them “miss out on opportunities” and to combat term-time holidays.It prompted a positive reaction from many.One viewer commented: “This guy is a traiblazer … excellent idea.

A week away every years didn’t affect her education.”But others were more critical.One commented: “My daughter is a teacher how would these parents feel if teachers took term time off .“I am sick of these parents putting their kids education second to holiday.” Another added: “What about teachers who also have to pay through the nose to go away during school holidays? Can we take time off during term time?!”Another wrote: “It’s selfish and unfair because not all families are doing it.”Simon previously told The BBC subjects he hoped students would cover on their own during enrichment week included English, maths, history, geography and languages.He said: If, for example, a family went to Greece, wed need to see that they have mastered some basic communication.“For geography wed need to see key information around GDP and population for history, the type of place and how the past has impacted.“English would be about literature, and maths will centre around currency."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000417616818.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bouncer describes how have a go hero nearly lost legs diving into car as driver tried to mow down revellers","story":"Danni Harding rushed to help Andy Niinemae, 34, as he dived through a car window to tackle the out-of-control driver.He ended up pinned between two cars as he was rammed by the raging driver outside the Miss Jones bar in Cardiff.As he lay stricken on the road, Danni tried to stop the flow of blood before Andy was taken to hospital for surgery on his leg - with his family saying he is lucky to be alive.Describing the horror, bouncer Danni, 28, said: I have never seen anything like it in my whole 10 years of doors.Some guy tried to run over about 20 customers, and another guy jumped in his car window to stop him.He nearly took his legs off, he drove him straight into a taxi then halfway down the road threw him out of the car.I have seen some grim stuff in my time, but looking inside someones legs, at the bone and tissue was next level.Andy has since been hailed a hero after rushing to help when the driver deliberately drove at the revellers on Saturday night.The motorist then smashed into a parked taxi before speeding off leaving a trail of debris.  Andys mum Joanne Niinemae said: My son jumped through a closed car window to stop a drunk driver who was aiming to mow people down who were outside a pub.The driver then slammed his car into another trapping his legs, with such force the bumper of car came off.His injuries were horrific with huge lacerations on leg and arm, resulting in emergency surgery.The security lady at Miss Jones pub saved his life as he saved many lives himself.

Everyone would just stare at us and we’d get horrible looks.“We just laughed it off. One day in a shop, the assistant called Andy my dad. I felt myself go bright red but Andy just kissed me on the cheek and told me not to worry about it.”In July 2016, eighteen months after they started dating, Andy proposed to Robyn during a trip to London.She says: “When I saw him get down on one knee I was over the moon. I said ‘yes’ straight away.“Andy is perfect and I can’t wait for us to spend the rest of our lives together.”Robyn and Andy welcomed their daughter, Madison, now one, to the world in September 2016.She says: “Andy had pure love in his eyes when he saw Madison for the first time.

A picture of the child holding hands with new husband Che Abdul Karim after their wedding widely circulated online was the catalyst for anger in the Muslim majority country. The bridegroom already has two wives and six children aged between five and 18, according to local media reports. His new bride\u0027s impoverished parents are said to have agreed to the marriage on the proviso that she lived with them until she was 16. The groom is a scrap rubber dealer who is comparatively wealthy. On Sunday he defended his actions, claiming that he had not eloped and had married her with permission of her family. I was disappointed with various criticisms and allegations made against me in the social media after I took her as my third wife, he told The Borneo Post .  He added that he did not intend to live with the girl until she was 16 and would get a marriage certificate at that point. UNICEF\u0027s representative in Malaysia Marianne Clark-Hattingh said: \u0027It is shocking and unacceptable and not in the best interest of the child. It is a violation of her rights. The minimum legal age for marriage in Malaysia under civil law is 18. However, girls can marry at 16 with the permission of their state\u0027s chief minister, while Islamic law sets a 16-year minimum age for girls and allows even earlier marriages with the permission of the sharia court. The Malaysian government has not record of the wedding and has launched an investigation. It is believed that the ceremony took place in Thailand.  \u0027The ministry looks seriously upon underage marriage... The ministry wants to discuss and cooperate with religious councils to examine and tighten laws so it can eradicate the issue of underage marriage,\u0027 said a statement from the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development. Malaysians also took to social media to express their outrage. By allowing this man to marry her, we just robbed this girl of her childhood. We must end child marriage.

At the same time, overpayments have soared to a record \u0026pound3.7 billion. The chaotic payments have prompted the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to be compared to a pinball machine in the way it handles public money. The National Audit Office (NAO) said overpayments, excluding state pensions, had climbed to an estimated 4.4% of related benefit spend from 4.1% in 2016-17. Underpayments are at their highest estimated level at \u0026pound1.7 billion, or 1% of total expenditure on benefits. The report found that official error accounted for \u0026pound470 million of the underpayments.  Chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, and former minister, Frank Field, told the Press Association: It\u0027s like a pinball machine, the payments system - you might get an overpayment, you might get an underpayment. Lots of people are not being paid Universal Credit when they should be, causing hardship, and the same department is overpaying others - what is going on? Estimated rates of fraud and error overpayments have increased across all continuously measured benefits, the report stated.

Number 10 insisted at the time that the US President was using his own words when he made the comment, during a press conference with the former PM ahead of the EU referendum .  But there was intense speculation at the time that the remark may have been scripted by Number 10, because the word queue is rarely used by Americans, who tend to prefer the phrase back of the line.  Mr Obama\u0027s then-foreign policy speechwriter Ben Rhodes has now revealed that the comment came up during a discussion between the US and UK sides about the implications of Brexit , and said that it was Mr Cameron who suggested the president should repeat it in public.   But Mr Rhodes stressed that Mr Obama believed that the warning was correct.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Mr Rhodes said: We had come here to try to help the Remain campaign and we had a meeting with David Cameron and his team and we were all kind of in violent agreement about the negative consequences of Brexit.  And in talking about the press conference they were going to hold together - Cameron and Obama - we were discussing the arguments for the Brexit campaign.

In a warning shot to Theresa May, Jim Mattis said he is concerned Britain\u0027s power could be eroded and pointed out France was ploughing cash into the armed forces. It is the latest in a string of leaks from the Ministry of Defence, whose top minister, Tory Gavin Williamson, has been accused of trying to launch a leadership bid. By coincidence, Mr Williamson has also been pushing for more cash to be spent on defence. US defence secretary General Mattis wrote to Mr Williamson ahead of next week\u0027s Nato summit - and a visit by Donald Trump to Britain.  General Mattis said he wanted the UK to remain America\u0027s partner of choice but also said that the French were committed to being global actors alongside the US. But he added: I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change. The letter, leaked to the Sun, was sent on June 12 and will reignite a Whitehall battle over defence funding. The UK is committed to meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, but the US hinted that it wants Mrs May to commit more money. Gen Mattis said: A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests. Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk.  Highlighting Emmanuel Macron\u0027s recent pledge to pump an extra \u0026pound260 billion into defence by 2025, Gen Mattis said: As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defence. Other allies are following suit. He stressed that it was in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice but in that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability. In a reference to the Whitehall rows over funding, Gen Mattis added: It is not for me to tell you how to prioritise your domestic spending priorities. But I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defence blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

The world\u0027s most popular beverage really does help people live longer - no matter how much they put away, according to new research. And it\u0027s not the caffeine that has the effect as the results were the same for those who drink decaff. In one of the biggest studies of its kind mortality rates of almost half a million middle aged and elderly Britons were compared with their coffee intake. Those who glugged six or seven cups a day fared best. They were 16 percent less likely to die from any disease over a ten year period than those who never touched the black stuff.  And the biggest coffee addicts did nearly as well. Those who got through eight cups a day - or more - saw death rates cut by 14 percent. This is twice the maximum amount of caffeine recommended by the UK Food Standards Agency. The protective effect was also identified among moderate and light coffee drinkers - but to a lesser degree. Two to five cups, one cup or less than one cup a day reduced mortality by 12, eight and six per cent, respectively, during the decade long analysis. Lead author Dr Erikka Loftfield, a cancer epidemiologist, said the results applied to all types of coffee including ground, instant and decaffeinated. The study published in JAMA Internal Medicine adds to mounting evidence coffee should be part of a healthy diet, she said.  No association was identified between any amount of coffee consumed and long-term health risks including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer. Dr Loftfield said the findings suggest the importance of its non-caffeine constituents. She said: In this large study of nearly 500,000 people in the United Kingdom, coffee drinking was inversely associated with all-cause mortality, with statistically significant inverse associations observed in participants drinking 1 to 8 or more cups per day. Coffee has long been linked with combating heart disease, cancer, dementia , diabetes and depression. It is abundant in antioxidants which reduce inflammation and boost lung function and sensitivity to the glucose-controlling hormone insulin. People are normally advised to drink no more than four cups of coffee a day - about 400mg. Too much caffeine can trigger insomnia, a fast heartbeat and even muscle tremors.   New cashpoint rule comes into force - and this is how it will affect you  The latest study was based on data from the UK BioBank, one of the world\u0027s most ambitious projects that tracks the health and lifestyles of hundreds of thousands of volunteers. It found coffee was just as big a benefit to the estimated ten percent of the population who carry a gene mutation that slows up caffeine digestion. This makes the stimulant stay in the body longer - raising fears coffee could spark a stroke or heart attack by causing high blood pressure. But the genetic data in the UK BioBank allowed Dr Loftfield to rule this theory out. She said: We found very similar associations between coffee drinking and mortality across levels of examined caffeine metabolism scores. She added: There has been concern about the health effects of heavy coffee drinking, particularly in participants with common genetic mutations that affect caffeine metabolism. Previous studies in the US, Europe and Asia have found a consistent link between coffee drinking and reduced deaths from all causes including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson\u0027s disease and liver, bowel and womb cancer.

Researchers found the battle for a seat amid the morning or afternoon rush-hour apparently leads to passengers neglecting their manners or failing to notice pregnant women. The study of 2,000 regular users of public transport also found one in four commuters hadn’t given up their seat for a \u0027pregnant\u0027 woman in case she wasn\u0027t actually expecting a child. The research was commissioned by Mama Mio skincare as part of their ‘I’m Expecting’ campaign which encourages expectant mums to not be afraid to ask someone to give up their seat. Ambassador for the #ExpectingChange campaign, Anna Whitehouse (@Mother_Pukka) said: “Pregnancy is not a weakness, but it is a vulnerability and I felt this during my first trimester in particular.  “Busy, hot, and cramped commuting conditions can be incredibly stressful both physically and mentally, and being able to sit down can make a difference. “However, from my own experience, I find that people are either too engrossed in their phones to be aware of their surroundings, or won’t offer their seat unless prompted. “I’d encourage anyone who needs a seat on public transport to wear a badge and make eye contact. If that fails, don’t suffer in silence - ask for one!” Natalie Cowley of Mama Mio said: “We were surprised at the findings, as we’d expected everyone would offer up their seat to a pregnant woman. “We were particularly shocked that only two per cent said you should offer a seat to a woman in her first trimester, considering how many suffer from severe symptoms during this time, including sickness and fatigue.”  The study also found adults believe you don’t need to offer mother-to-be a seat until she is visibly showing, with three in 10 saying so. Eighteen per cent agreed you should offer a seat during a woman’s third trimester, with 11 per cent saying you should during the second. And just two per cent said you should offer up your seat when a woman is within her first 12 weeks of pregnancy. One in 20 have even ‘stayed put’ over offering up their seat to an expectant mother because they had a reserved ticket. Seven per cent of women admitted to being offered a seat after being mistaken for being pregnant and a shocking fifth of expectant mothers have been too embarrassed to ask for a seat themselves. One in five are afraid of who they might offend by offering up a seat on public transport, so they simply don’t bother. The study also revealed that among the list of \u0027commuter etiquette\u0027 are letting people off before you get on, turning down your music and moving down the bus or train when space is limited.  Not putting your feet on a seat, avoiding consuming smelly food and having your ticket ready to avoid queue pile ups also featured in the top 20. But despite the unwritten rules, nearly one in five admitted they don’t always follow these outlines of common courtesy themselves. And many are living under the notion that rules vary from bus to tube to train, with more Brits giving up their seat on a bus than on a tube or tram. The hustle and bustle of modern life means two thirds agreed Brits are typically rude when it comes to travelling on public transport. More than half said commuters are impatient and so their manners fall by the wayside, with an equal number agreeing Brits are too buried in their phones.

Thomas Kolodzeij spent months designing the escape room in his bid to create the \u0027scariest house\u0027 in Nottingham. The 25-year-old, who runs serviced apartments in the city, said he had made plans to turn the flat and adjoining unit into a horror house business within just five minutes of stepping inside. The attraction, on St Ann\u0027s Wells Road, has been given rave reviews from horror fans from across the country - but other haven\u0027t enjoyed it as much.   In fact, Thomas said most visitors only manage to endure the nightmare experience for 30 minutes, reports Nottinghamshire Live .  He said: One group of four locked themselves in a tiny room 1m by 1m and stayed there until the actors had gone and it was time to come out. There have been some funny situations since we opened it but we have had good reviews on Facebook and TripAdvisor. It\u0027s mostly been horror fans who have come to do it. We\u0027ve had people from Essex and even further visit.  He said his latest venture is a mix between the \u0027horror house\u0027 attractions often seen in America and on mainland Europe, and the more popular escape rooms, where people are given clues to escape from a locked room. I have been to horror houses in Poland and Ukraine but I don\u0027t think they are as scary as mine, he added. That\u0027s just my opinion. It takes a lot to scare me and although I enjoyed them, I wasn\u0027t really that scared. I don\u0027t want to give too much away. We have some actors who work here but I won\u0027t say how many. It is a mix between a horror house and an escape room. It lasts about an hour, but I the average time people have lasted is about 30 minutes so far.  The idea presented itself to Mr Kolodzeij as he was walking through the property, but it took him around two to three months to make it come to fruition. Within five minutes I knew what I wanted to do, he said. There was a flat and a unit next to it so I knocked a hole in the wall to join them together. It took about two months to get ready and we opened at the end of April. We\u0027ve had about 70 or 80 groups come so far. There are still a few ideas I have that I want to use. I am always watching on the CCTV so I will see something and come up with an idea.

The convertible, which McLaren Automotive donated to the Elton John AIDS Foundation, would have typically cost around \u0026pound165,000. But at the star-studded bash, attended by the likes of Ed Sheeran, Victoria Beckham and Tracey Emin, it ended up being bought by an anonymous bidder for \u0026pound725,000. All of the proceeds from the sale at Sir Elton John’s home in Berkshire will go towards helping create an AIDS-free future.  Sir Elton said We are thrilled with the success of the event.

Their new car is fitted with a 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine which develops 562bhp.  This gives the McLaren 570S Spider a 0-62mph time of 3.2 seconds and a 0-124mph time of 9.6 seconds. It has a top speed of 204mph, making it one of the world’s quickest convertibles. The roof is an electrically-folding hardtop that can be lowered in just 15 seconds at speeds of up to 25mph. To mark the sale and celebrate the Argento Ball’s silver anniversary, the special 570S Spider was hand-sprayed in special metallic ‘Blade Silver’.  The McLaren has incredible stopping power thanks to its carbon ceramic brakes. At 124mph, the high-powered brakes will bring the McLaren to a standstill in just 133 metres. At 62mph, the McLaren will be stationary in just 32 metres.

Mums and dads dropping kids off at East Brent C of E Academy in Highbridge, Somerset claim they are being deliberately targeted by vandals annoyed at losing their spaces. Grandmother Janet Smith said neighbours have shouted abuse at parents and claims one mum told her a resident threatened to put nails in her tyres if she didn\u0027t stop parking there. Janet said she knows several parents affected - and believes nails are being hidden among leaves, fixed in an upright position to inflict maximum damage. One neighbour, who wanted to remain anonymous, said people park on both sides of the road, stopping people getting out their homes and leaving no room to pass or turn around.  The woman also said people leave their cars in residents driveways - and at times leaves so little room emergency vehicles wouldn\u0027t be able to pass. She also claimed parents have been abusive to neighbours - and said she did not understand this nail thing. Old Rectory Close is in the village of East Brent and just yards from The Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin - where cricketer Ben Stokes got married - and homes are valued at around \u0026pound500,000. Police say they are investigating and treating it as criminal damage. Janet, 62, drops her two six-year-old grandchildren off at the school three times a week and says she recently found a screw on her tyre after parking in nearby Rectory Close.  After discussions among parents about the spate of sharp objects scattered on the road, Janet says a small boy began to investigate and found a bent nail. Janet said: “Nails are being placed at the side of the road. “I went there on Thursday morning and got back into my car and turned around in the close and I thought, ‘What’s that noise?’ “I looked around and couldn’t see anything but when I got home and when the wheel was in a different position I could see it was a screw that was making the noise. “Somebody is going to have a nasty accident. The parking isn’t dangerous and nobody is being blocked or anything like that. “It is straightforward legal parking and this is the way they are tackling it.  Janet fears somebody could end up having a blow out on a major road if their vehicle is driven with a nail or screw in the tyre. She has since returned to Rectory Close to pick up nails which have been placed in the road. She added: One of the mums was told that if she didn\u0027t stop parking there, she was going to find nails in her tyres. She added: \u0027\u0027We\u0027ve been parking there and some of the neighbours have become a bit irate about it.  It started a week ago when a man found two screws. Everyone is being a bit careful. The other day I took my grandchildren to school and heard a noise. I stopped the car and couldn\u0027t see anything. By the time I got home I could see it straight away - there was a screw in there. She says around four or five people have been effected. The police have been here, Janet said. The screws were glued to the road. The police have been up there and taken pictures. “It’s not private. It’s a cul-de-sac and we’re there for ten minutes.”  Janet\u0027s husband John also says that nails have been glued in so they face up. A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Constabulary said: “We can confirm that we received a report from a woman that she discovered a screw in the tyre of her vehicle when she returned home to Church Road after doing the school run. “She believes this was deliberate. “We are treating the incident as criminal damage and are keen to hear from anyone who may have information to contact us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman left tears car wash","story":"NewsWoman left in tears as car wash is installed right next to her fence towering over gardenAnne Parker, 79, says she used to enjoy sitting out in her garden but she says her tranquility has been shattered\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByPhilip Dewey09:03, 2 JUL 2018Updated10:22, 2 JUL 2018NewsThe car wash right outside Anne Parker\u0027s home in Pontypridd (Image: Wales Online)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has been left in tears after a car wash was installed just outside her garden.

The team of ghost hunters, Bear and Wolf, travelled to Coombe Abbey near Coventry so they could look into its ghoulish past.  Coombe Abbey was a Cistercian monastery built in the 1100s and is now a hotel, reports Coventry Live .  Most of the supposed spooky happenings at the abbey are blamed on the \u0027ghost\u0027 of Abbott Geoffrey, a monk who was murdered in 1345. Guests have reported seeing a cowled figure \u0027float around the hotels\u0027 grounds. A Romany girl, called Matilda, is also said to haunt the hotel - dressed in rags and found near the stables.  She is claimed to have been abused by men from the Craven family who owned the abbey in the 19th century, and so-called The Shadow Warriors wanted to find out more of her tragic tale. Before dying in childbirth, Matilda cursed the family who were said to have then suffered terrible luck. Other spirits reported at the hotel include a ghostly horseman and a Victorian woman who stands at the roadside. Bear said: “When we first arrived we connected with the spirit of a young girl, Matilda, she was a stable-hand when Coombe Abbey was still a manor house. “We picked up her presence, then we read the history afterwards when we had seen the footage, and the history didn’t match to what our medium gave us which was that Matilda was actually sexually abused by the Cravens, in the secret room. We had full access to the manor house then and there is a secret room on the fourth floor. “We picked up that she was pregnant, but Craven didn’t want anything to do with the child or any rumours going around, to harm his reputation. So the baby was born but it was taken from her by caesarean section, and it was done privately in the house and the child was eventually lost. Matilda put a curse on the family, because they betrayed her with these sexual relations that were against her will, then they were cursed that any of their own children were to die. “That’s what we picked up. Then when we looked back through, we found out it was actually true.

Little Reginald Fields was hoping to raise cash for candy over the summer, so set up Mr Reggie\u0027s Lawn Cutting Service alongside his siblings and cousins. And they began doing odd gardening jobs in the Ohio neighbourhood. But when the 12-year-old and his team unintentionally cut some grass on a neighbour\u0027s property the police were called over the \u0027trespassing.\u0027 Cops arrived to the shock of other residents.  “If they would have been four white children, the police would not have been called,” said neighbour Lucille Holt-Colden who filmed the children\u0027s hardwork. The incident sparked outrage in the community and his story soon went worldwide, as  previously reported. Reggie was left so disheartened by the drama he considered throwing in the towel and calling it a day. However, Reggie\u0027s plight has been met with an outpouring of support and money which has given him the encouragement to carry on - and now his business is booming with requests for his services. More than $36,000 has been raised over the last two days through a GoFundMe page , which initially had a target of $1,000.  Reggie is hoping to use the money to buy new equipment. Just give me a call. I will be there. On time! he said. He\u0027s even set up a business page which has been flooded with comments calling him an inspiration and saying he has a bright future ahead of him. Reggie also now plans on expanding his lawn cutting service into a landscaping business. His mum Brandy said: He wants to do it all year-round. He wants to rake leaves. He wants to snow blow. He wants to do it all. He said something about opening up a store that sells parts, she added. He has his mind set.

The mum, who goes by the username ClinicallySilly, posted in a popular online discussion forum, seeking advice on social conduct. I see a mum on the school run every morning wearing very see-through leggings. Today, she bent down in front of me to get something out of the pram basket and I was greeted by a view of her arse through her leggings.   She had a pink thong on under thin black leggings and a top which stopped at her hips. So everything was visible, I felt embarrassed on her behalf, the woman wrote on Mumsnet .  She then asked, if she were to see her again, should she \u0027diplomatically\u0027 tell her that everything was on show. She added: I\u0027d want to know I think. It\u0027s hard to see how see-through a fabric is until you wear it and you wont always be aware that your backside is on view. Many users were in agreement and said they would want to know if it were them. One mum said: I\u0027ve seen this sort of thing so often and always wonder if the wearer is aware of it. I suspect not. Tell her if you\u0027re brave enough.  Another wrote: I would tell her. She might not know, I emailed someone from another department at work I could see their knickers. She didn\u0027t reply but she spent the rest of the day with a jacket around her waist and never wore those trousers again so clearly she didn\u0027t realise.

Zlatko Sikorsky, 34, has been charged with the murder of Larissa Beilby, 16, and will appear in court in Australia today. He was also charged with misconduct with a corspe.  Sikorsky was cornered by police last week following a 28-hour siege where he holed himself up in a flat and threatened to shoot if officers came near him.  The Courier-Mail reported that Sikorsky\u0027s lawyer Brendan Ryan said his client is innocent.  He said: The evidence will no doubt support a death through misadventure. Sikorsky is now refusing to speak to police following his arrrest. Police launched a hunt for him after the decomposing remains believed to be those of Larissa were found in a vehicle. A woman claims she saw a “dead arm” sticking out of a blue barrel in the back of a stolen utility truck when a man thought to be Sikorsky pointed a shotgun at her. Larissa was staying at a shelter for homeless youths after escaping her former violent boyfriend, and was allegedly in a relationship with Sikorsky, who is twice her age and is wanted for parole violations. Reports have claimed Larissa and Sikorsky were in a relationship, but police have only said they were associated. She had told friends she was worried he would find out that she was 16, the Courier-Mail reported.  Detectives believe a network of criminals could have been helping him hide. A man thought to be Sikorsky fled a home in Buccan, in Logan, when it was visited by police looking for the teen. A woman who lives at a gated complex in nearby Stapylton claimed to AAP that a man, believed to be Sikorsky, pointed a shotgun at her and offered her money to let him inside the estate. The woman claims she saw a dead arm sticking out of a blue barrel on the ute\u0027s tray.   She said: “There was a blue barrel with, all I’ve seen is an arm flapping out, it was a little bit scary. I just seen [sic] an arm, a dead arm.” With a gun pointed at them, the woman and her partner opened the gate and let the man inside the complex where the ute was abandoned. Police arrested Sikorsky after he finally gave himself up on Saturday. Acting Detective Superintendent White said: Our thoughts are very much with Miss Beilby\u0027s family as they come to terms with and mourn her death.

Christina Rickardsson\u0027s remarkable upbringing, which bears some resemblance to the Disney classic Jungle Book, saw her raised by a mother deep in the Brazilian rainforest .  The 35-year-old says she had to eat birds and berries for food and was close to starvation while living in the wilderness. She tells the story of her savage childhood an a new book, Never Stop Walking. Rickardsson reveals she once killed a street child whom she had to kill in order to survive.  Her mum, Petronilia, had brought her to the caves when she was 15 days old in April 1983 after running away from her abusive brother.  Rickardsson reveals in her book, serialised in news.au : Achingly poor, we would eat birds killed by slingshot and regularly hike to Diamantina (the nearest town) to sell dried leaves and flowers and buy rice.  I gained confidence from hunting and scavenging and still recall my immense pride when I claimed my first bird, which we grilled over our tiny fire pit. Rickardsson also describes how both she hid from man-eating jaguars saying: The growling was enough to make my mother and me shake with fear. As well as dodging poisonous snakes, spiders and scorpions, as a young girl Rickardsson had to have her wits about her living rough. Both she and her mother often begged on the streets of Sao Paulo for money where they were spat at and called \u0027cockroaches\u0027.  And aged seven, Rickardsson got in a fight with a street boy over a piece of bread from a bin. She wrote: Grappling on the ground, I heard a clinking sound next to me — a big piece of a glass bottle. I picked it up in my hand. He turned around, and without thinking, still moving, I jabbed that piece of glass at his belly as hard as I could. At first I felt nothing. Then my hand got warm. Blood gushed from the wound. I took the bread from the boy as he screamed and doubled over in pain. After I\u0027d run a fair way, I started eating. But then I started vomiting. The realisation of what I\u0027d done hit me.\u0027 Days later, Rickardsson heard a rumour that the boy had died.

I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden. It was just fantastic – I couldn’t have wished for anything more for my birthday.“We also went out for dinner and visited friends to celebrate but Donkey Bond was an extra special surprise.”Scott said he knew he had to do something special to mark the occasion.“I have been with Sandra for about two and a half years and I was stuck about what to get her for her 50th birthday,” he said.“I was really struggling because she couldn’t tell me anything she wanted and I knew I needed to do something big and a bit different.“My friend’s aunt owns the farm and when we found out there was a donkey being hand-reared in their house because his mother had disowned him, we just thought it was amazing and he was so cute.“Donkey Bond – who is named in honour of James Bond actor Sean Connery – has his own Facebook page and I thought, ‘I wonder if they would bring him to surprise Sandra?’.“We both absolutely love animals anyway and had been following all his social media posts so I knew Sandra would love it.“It was also the first time that Donkey Bond had ever come out for a birthday surprise like this and he was absolutely fantastic.”Scott added: “Sandra is still speaking about it now and I think she will be for the next 10 years.“It really is something for her to remember and I am really glad she liked it.“I also got her a voucher to go up to the farm and walk the alpacas which will be fabulous.“It is even better because I wanted to do it as well so I will able to go along with her.”Nicky said: “Sandra’s reaction when she opened the door was amazing – absolutely brilliant.“Scott got in contact with me because he wanted to do something different for her birthday and he knew my aunt owns Balnuith Farm.“He is a very cute donkey – he lives in the farmhouse kitchen and is toilet-trained like a dog.“There is no chance that Sandra will forget her 50th.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/SNS-15161584-Dundee-UTD-Train.jpg-838x564.jpg ","title":"dundee is football crazy i want to earn my shirt says new united keeper siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe mix of ambition and expectation is why Benjamin Siegrist jumped at the chance to up sticks and join Dundee United.The giant Swiss keeper wanted to quit Swiss football for a new challenge and believes the Tangerines tick all the boxes.“Obviously the expectations here are high, but I believe it is good to be part of something when expectations are high,” said the 26-year-old, who was an U/17 World Cup winner with Switzerland.“The gaffer is very ambitious and very focused on details as well. I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals. I hope going forwards from here that it will be the same this term at St Mary’s.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united coach ian cathro teams up with former boss at wolves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Hearts boss Ian Cathro has been appointed first-team coach of Premier League newcomers Wolves.Dundonian Cathro, who spent eight months at Tynecastle, was Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo’s assistant at Rio Ave in 2012 and at Valencia.The pair met on a Scottish Football Association coaching course in 2009.“I am very excited about joining Wolves and looking forward to working with a coach and staff I know, trust and believe in,” said Cathro.“All of us share the same footballing philosophy and that is such an important factor for a successful coaching team.“Wolves is a fantastic club with a rich history and lots of potential, and I can’t wait to get started.”Cathro, who began his coaching career at Dundee United, has also been assistant boss at Newcastle and met the Wolves squad on Wednesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"major tayside road closed in both directions after traffic collision","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA major Tayside road is closed in both directions after a traffic collision.THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED \u0026#8211 FEMALE AIRLIFTED TO NINEWELLSThe A9 is currently closed in both directions at the Dalguise turn off, about one mile north of Dunkeld, Perthshire.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))A9 CURRENTLY CLOSED AT DALGUISEThe A9 is currently closed inboth directions at the Dalguise turn off, about 1 mile north of Dubkeld, due to a road traffic collision.Posted by Tayside Police Division on\u0026nbspMonday, 2 July 2018Folk are being warned to avoid the area if possible.THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED \u0026#8211 FEMALE AIRLIFTED TO NINEWELLS\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32068acec06-839x564.jpg ","title":"new boy mendy almost signed by dundee in january","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has revealed he was close to signing new Dundee arrival Jean Alassane Mendy back in January.He held talks with the Senegalese striker back then but was pipped for his signature by Belgians Lokeren.Things did not work out for Mendy there and now Neil is delighted to have been able to get a player he believes can score regularly in the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220We tried to get him in January and I think we missed out by just a couple of hours.

This concern has also been raised by a local member.“It is noted by one of the local members that residents of Invergowrie frequently raise concerns about the volume of traffic that uses the Main Street to avoid the Swallow roundabout in the evening peak. There is concern that the proposed scheme has the potential to cause an increase in vehicles using this route as a rat-run.“The application does not include any traffic flow modelling that could give reassurance in this regard. It is noted that drivers choose their routes based on what ‘appears faster’ and therefore might prefer to cut through Invergowrie rather than risk a relatively short delay at a traffic signal.”Ms Beer said that there had been 24 crashes on Main Street since 1999, which was more than similar villages in the area, and called for traffic surveys to be carried out if the work goes ahead. “This would allow the measurement of any resulting changes in (traffic) flow,” she added.“If there is such a change, with more vehicles travelling through Invergowrie, then a commitment to carry out any remedial works or an appropriate financial contribution should be required.”Councillor Richard McCready, whose West End ward includes the roundabout, said he had asked the council for details on the impact of the upgrade.He said: “Theoretically this should be a good thing but I don’t think the four ways you can go on this roundabout have equal traffic volumes.“I also want to make sure there are no adverse affects to the air quality in the area.”No details have yet been revealed on when the work to upgrade the roundabout will take place.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

McInnes said: “Sometimes you need those forward players to make the difference to turn one point into three.”On a positive day for McInnes, summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson also delivered solid debuts.Centre-back Mikey Devlin finally made his debut six months after signing on at Pittodrie.Devlin had been out for more than a year with a cruciate ligament damage but cruised through the game against Cobh.But it was Forrester who stole the show with the vital goal.McInnes said: “In terms of his touch and his passing ability the reason we brought Chris here was because he can be the difference.“I think Chris can be that for us either through his assists or his goals.“It is something that is important to him, to be more relevant in the final third rather than just be seen as a good passer.“Against Cobh Ramblers he was the difference with a lovely finish with his left foot.“He just shifts the ball on to it and gives us that bit of quality.“He scored a good goal and it was one that we deserved as we were the better side.”Dubliner Forrester was introduced on the half-hour mark at the Fota Island Resort.With the mercury hitting close to 30 degrees it was decided by both teams to split the match into three half-hour sections.McInnes said: “Chris is a confident boy and has to get used to the demands of us as well.“There were moments when you could see his quality.“His touch is so true, he plays with his head up and the crispness of passing is there.“Chris has some work to do to make sure his game is that bit more rounded for us.“That is the demands we are going to put on him.”Striker Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the team for the friendly having picked up knocks in training.McInnes is confident both will be fit to face Falkirk on Wednesday at Arbroath’s Gayfield stadium.The manager said: “Stevie and Sam are fine.“The ground was rock hard and maybe we over-worked them on Thursday.“Both have worked extremely well and looked sharp in the football work we have done.“It was just at the tail-end of the work on Thursday when we pushed them a wee bit.“The physios have guaranteed they will be good to go for Falkirk.”Aberdeen faced Ramblers just nine days after returning for pre-season training.In contrast the Cork-based side are midway through their domestic league.McInnes was impressed with the centre-back partnership of Devlin and Scott McKenna who never looked troubled by Cobh.However, he accepts the Reds, who hit the post through Adam Rooney, needed to be sharper up front.McInnes said: “There was a lot of good from that game.“It is a step towards where we want to be and we want to make those gradual improvements as we go along.“There was some sloppiness as you would expect.“Even though we were against a team who we were expected to beat you could see they were a bit sharper to the ball.“You could see they were a team in mid- season.“We have to make sure that we make those little steady improvements as we go along.“I can’t be disappointed as a clean sheet was never really in doubt.“We defended well and worked hard enough.“When you make so many changes in a game sometimes it upsets the fluency.“It has been a strong week for some and there is more work for some to get up to where we want.“In terms of what the players have given us since we came back in I am really pleased with their fitness levels.“I was just looking for that wee bit more quality and goal threat from the game.

via the scheme’s innovative subsea cabling – the first time that cabling of this capacity has been installed on a commercial offshore wind project in Scotland.Gunnar Groebler, Vattenfall’s head of business area wind, said: “Generating power from the EOWDC for the first time, secured by Europe’s technological leadership in offshore wind, gets us to a future free from fossil fuel faster.\u0026#8220I look forward to full power later in the summer.”Adam Ezzamel, Vattenfall’s EOWDC project director, said: “We have overcome major engineering and technical challenges to achieve first power on the cutting edge EOWDC thanks to the collective expertise of Vattenfall, and our contractors MHI Vestas, Boskalis and Murphy.\u0026#8220Our priority now is to fully commission the

for offshore wind generation.”Jean Morrison, chair of Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) added: “The timescale between the first installation and first power is remarkable.\u0026#8220The techniques and innovations developed at the EOWDC will be hugely significant for the industry and should help to reduce the future costs of offshore wind.\u0026#8220As energy demand grows, we need to

from the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines which, with each rotation at full power, will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours.“Once the test and demonstration site is fully operational, not only will this help the offshore wind sector to further reduce its costs through lessons learned during operations, but the output from EOWDC will itself add significantly to Scotland’s renewable electricity generating capacity, building on figures announced last month that showed installed capacity reached a record 10.4GW in the first three months of 2018 and which also

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life. A\u0026ampB is home to many country roads enjoyed by bikers, so road safety is clearly a key issue for our team.\u0026#8217Anyone interested in learning more about the Scottish Biker Down or would like to book one of the courses can email adam.barclay@firescotland.gov.uk to book your place on the course or visit our Facebook page ‘Biker Down Scotland’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"council pays formal tribute to islays ww100 group","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 2:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowArgyll and Bute Council has formally recognised Islay’s ambitious programme of events commemorating two World War One tragedies off the coast of the island.Council members thanked Islay\u0026#8217s WW100 committee for providing an inspirational programme of events to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of SS Tuscania and the collision of HMS Otranto, which took place off the shores of Islay during the Great War.At a meeting of the full council this week members paid tribute to the group for their part in organising the national remembrance events, honouring those who lost their lives in the incidents, and providing a lasting legacy for the local community.Provost of Argyll and Bute, Len Scoullar said: \u0026#8216The WW100 group both national and local must be congratulated for arranging such a well-organised series of events to honour and pay respect to those who lost their lives in these tragedies, and commemorate the people of Islay who were involved in the response to the incidents.\u0026#8216The island really came together, engaging young and old, showcasing resilience, compassion and kindness.

The star of the show for Brian and Janet, however, was a home-bred ewe which took first prize in her class and was reserve female champion.Campbeltown\u0026#8217s John MacLachlan was there showing Blue Faced Leicester sheep for J\u0026ampM Turner, Killdalloig with the help of Gavin Semple and Scott Thomason.He came home with a first place and reserve male champion rosette for his tup lamb, sired by Mossvale Masterplan (AI) from a mother out of a Hazelwood ewe.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s the first time out for this lamb, said John, and this is the first time I\u0026#8217ve won with a male at the Highland Show, it\u0026#8217s normally females we do well with.\u0026#8217Kildalloig also secured sixth places for their tup and ewe lamb and fourth for a shearling tup.In the coloured Bluefaced Leicester ring, Lochgoilhead\u0026#8217s Andrew Campbell came second with a tup lamb and sixth with his ewe.

The McKechnies also took home a second for a home-bred cow and her February-born calf.Catherine said afterwards: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s satisfying when you come to the show with two beasts and they go home with red and blue tickets \u0026#8211 and a reserve female champion \u0026#8211 so we can\u0026#8217t ask for much more.\u0026#8217The majestic heavy horse classes are a sight to behold, and there was a prize for a Clydesdale which has won both Kintyre and Mid Argyll shows in recent years.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton.

Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"andrews-mum-and-sis-go-the-distance-in-bid-to-find-cure","story":"THE family of a West Linton man struck down by a rare and debilitating health condition have raised almost \u0026pound10,000 with two marathon sporting challenges.\nAndrew Macnab was diagnosed last August with dermatomyositis.\nFewer than one in a million people are affected by the incurable condition which causes skin rashes, muscle weakness, and inflammatory myopathy.\nBut treatments can control the symptoms and research is ongoing to try to find a cure.\nLast month, Andrew\u0027s wee sister Helen, who lives in Stow, completed her very first marathon in Edinburgh - raising a staggering \u0026pound5,200 for Myositis UK.\nAnd just last week Andrew\u0027s mum Jean, along with her friends at West Linton Golf Club, raised a further \u0026pound4,100 with a 24-hour golfing challenge.\nThroughout the challenge Jean managed to play for the entire 24 hours - completing an amazing 140 holes.\nJean told us: \"Although I was a little weary by the end of the relay, I was over-joyed by the support and friendship from the members of West Linton Golf Club as well as many others from the village and beyond.\n\"The relay has raised funds to date of over \u0026pound4,100, providing another great boost for the funding of research by Myositis UK.\"\nBoth Jean and Helen are continuing to raise money for Mystosis UK which carries out research into the Andrew\u0027s condition.\nThe volunteer-led charity works to improve the diagnosis, treatment, understanding, and prognosis of the rare inflammatory myopathies.\nJean added: \"Andrew continues to fight against the effects of that illness, and has recently been showing small signs of improvement \u0026ndash at long last.\n\"We know that further research is essential to understand this rare illness, and find which treatments are most effective.\n\"As well as hoping that such research will improve Andrew\u0026rsquos chance of a full return to normal life, we hope that others suffering from this cruel illness can be helped.\"\nTo support Helen - www.justgiving/fundraising/helen-runs-edinburgh-marathon - or Jean - www.justgiving/fundraising/west-linton-ladies-golf - visit their justgiving pages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bins-set-alight-outside-hawick-shop","story":"WITNESSES are being sought after two bins were set alight near a shop in Hawick.\nThe fire happened at around 3.25am on Friday, June 22 on the town\u0027s High Street.\nTwo large metal wheelie bins were set alight at the rear of The Card Factory store, however quick action of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service mean the fire was extinguished before the flames could spread.\nAs a result, the outer wall and a window sustained damage, while one of the building vents was also destroyed.\nNo one was injured and inquiries are ongoing to identify whoever was responsible.\nInspector Kevin Harris from Hawick Police Station said: \"Had this fire spread then a number of homes and businesses could have been affected.\n\"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious within the High Street during the early hours of Thursday morning, or who can help us trace the culprits.\n\"Anyone with information should contact police immediately.\"\nThose with information can contact Hawick Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 426 of June 22.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716327639,16326935,16326589,16326578,16326073\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"              Prestonpans Children\u0027s Gala Day went ahead yesterday as families braved the stormy weather to enjoy the fun.

They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"              THE A198 has been closed and emergency services are at the scene after a car accident near Gullane.

A retail development with four units and a \u0026lsquodrive-thru\u0026rsquo coffee shop are proposed at the site to the west of the town, close to the Oak Tree Junction of the A1.  The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"              A COMPUTER arts student will fly halfway round the world as part of a three-person team taking part in the finals of an international Microsoft competition.  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

North Berwick Youth Project is keen to carry out work to the run-down shelter to give their members a place to spend their time.  A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.  Preliminary community consultation has taken place through an online survey, with 80 per cent backing the youth project\u0026rsquos proposals.  Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter. As the project moves forward, the community and the residents will be consulted at every stage, including the design.  She also stressed that the group hoped the refurbished shelter could be used \u0026ldquofor the whole community, adding: \u0026ldquoWe hope that by taking a collaborative approach we will be able to deal with the concerns that have been raised."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7853709.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"queen-formally-welcomed-to-edinburgh-at-start-of-holyrood-week","story":"              The Queen has taken part in an ancient ceremony to formally welcome her to Edinburgh at the start of Holyrood week.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

Here the sun always shines, the men have six packs, the women have curves in all the right places and the only thing you need to worry about is how much grafting (to use the show\u0027s lingo) you have to put into attracting the opposite sex.  Unless you\u0027ve been living in deep freeze, it\u0027s hard to escape the cultural phenomenon that is the Bafta-winning, dating reality TV show, Love Island. It revolves around a dizzying array of \u0026ldquosexy singles who purport to be looking for true love, along with the \u0026pound50,000 prize money (or, let\u0027s be honest, a launch pad for a celeb career), and spend up to eight weeks in a luxury villa in Mallorca trying to convince audiences that they\u0027ve found the man, or woman, of their dreams. It\u0027s knowingly narrated for laughs by Scottish comedian Iain Stirling and hosted by reality TV veteran Caroline Flack.  Whether or not it\u0027s working out for contestants, Love Island\u0027s fourth series is certainly pulling in the audiences of ITV2\u0027s dreams. An average 2.9 million people tuned in for the launch episode on June 4, more than double that of the first episode in 2017. Last week it was the highest-rating TV show at 9pm, with audiences \u0026ndash more than half of whom are in the 16-34 age range (the holy grail of TV producers) \u0026ndash peaking at 3.4million viewers. It has an overall audience share of 16 percent, that rises to almost 50 percent of younger viewers, and a whole range of merch.  Even if it sounds closer to your version of hell than paradise, there is no denying its widespread influence. But it\u0027s only a daft game show, right? As with any mainstream hit there\u0027s been plenty of sneering, about those who watch as much as those on-screen. In some ways you can see why.  In a month in which Donald Trump\u0027s immigration policies at the US border saw toddlers ripped from their mothers\u0027 arms and children kept in cages, while others were bombed in Yemen, could we really feel justified in worrying about whether Wes Nelson would be best off sticking with 29-year-old air hostess Laura Anderson or cracking on with surgically enhanced Megan Barton-Hanson? As Brexit negotiations continued to hurtle towards the cliff-edge, dragging us all towards who-knows-what, was it really OK to stuff our fingers in our ears until 9pm when we could relax into wondering if increasingly uptight and awkward A\u0026ampE doctor Alex George would finally convince a girl to fancy him?  Dr Faye Woods, lecturer in film and television at Reading University, dismisses this either/or view. She points out that while audiences of this female-targeted series are met with derision, it\u0027s not just socially acceptable, but actively expected, that men will down tools to watch the World Cup.  \u0026ldquoThis is an event bringing the nation together that isn\u0026rsquot terrible men\u0026rsquos footie, she says. \u0026ldquoLove Island gives us that space to breathe and focus on something else, a little oasis of pleasure amidst our current darkness. We can hold multiple thoughts in our brain simultaneously, and refocusing for a while every night is healthy for our well-being.  Which seems fair enough. And who doesn\u0027t like watching beautiful people? There\u0027s a fascination not just in their symmetrical features and gym-fit bodies, but in the amount of effort that goes into grooming \u0026ndash the carefully layered tans and whitened teeth, shaved chests, perfectly arched brows and painted nails (which mostly happens off camera, as if by magic).  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a kind of vicarious pleasure, reckons Gladeana McMahon, a psychological adviser for reality shows such as the early Big Brother series, and the driving force behind the production of the \u0026ldquoEthical Guidelines for Reality TV produced by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u0026ldquoThis is the gladiatorial pit without the violence.  But as she points out, ITV2 has set out to get big audiences by going for a winning formula, that is, in many ways, nostalgic and safe. While it\u0027s supposedly all about glamour and sexual sizzle \u0026ndash once you\u0027re coupled up with someone you share a double bed in the dorm and see what you can get away with under the duvet \u0026ndash this dream seems in some ways weirdly old-fashioned.  In an age in which woke millennials are seemingly increasingly accepting of gender as a fluid rather than a binary concept, the stereotypes on display \u0026ndash where men talk about treating women like queens, being \u0026ldquogentlemen, and some of the girls play dumb to get the guy \u0026ndash pull progressive views up short.  It\u0027s all about the archetypes. Adam Collard \u0026ndash trading on Garden of Eden associations and looking for temptation \u0026ndash describes himself as tall, dark and handsome, with great abs. What more could anyone want, he wonders aloud? (A little bit of respect and common decency it turns out, but more of that later.)  As Nicola Bishop, a researcher in English and television at Manchester politan University, notes: \u0026ldquoThis is \u0026lsquopin-up\u0026rsquo TV with little diversity of body types. There is a lot of readable anxiety among the male competitors about measuring up against perceived physical ideals of masculinity.  The love on this heteronormative island is not for everyone. There are lots of reality TV shows that have been very positive about representing LGBT contestants \u0026ndash Brian Dowling, winner of Big Brother\u0027s second series, is testament to that. This isn\u0027t one of them. While last year\u0027s Love Island did include a short bisexual romance between two of the women, and host Caroline Flack hinted there may be gay contestants in the future, bosses are clear. It\u0027s a dating show for straight couples and everyone needs to fancy each other. They claim they wouldn\u0027t rule out a standalone show but none is forthcoming so far.  As versions of romance go, despite the bed-swapping, it\u0027s an interestingly traditional one. Several commentators have pointed out that with its claustrophobic sense of ennui, codified courting behaviour and double-crossing, the dream on offer has more than a whiff of Jane Austen about it all.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s the Diana story, it\u0027s Cinderella, adds McMahon. Considering the number of people getting married in the UK is at an all-time low, there\u0027s an awful lot of talk about it. Adam claims there\u0027s not a girl in the house that he wouldn\u0027t want as a wife, while Laura hints to 20-year-old Wes, after sharing a bed with him for a few weeks, that she\u0027s on the look-out for a husband.  While in the real world there might be an increasing acceptance of less traditional relationships, or even non-monogamous ones, what\u0027s on offer here is what writer and columnist Laurie Penny refers to as Love TM. This search for Mr or Mrs Right is what she calls \u0026ldquothe narrow romantic fantasy that trumps all other forms of love, which is put on a pedestal as the answer to all our life problems and insecurities and never questioned. As beautiful lawyer Rosie Williams, ditched by Adam, cries to the other girls \u0026ldquoI just want to be enough, you wish she already knew she was.  It is her experience too that shows the darker side of the fairytale \u0026ndash Hans Christian Andersen rather than Disney \u0026ndash with Women\u0027s Aid going as far as issuing a warning about spotting the signs of abuse in response to Adam\u0027s \u0026ldquogaslighting of her (a term used to describe psychological manipulation aimed at making someone question their version of reality). The charity said there were clear warning signs in Adam\u0027s behaviour of emotional abuse and called on viewers to speak out against unhealthy relationships.  Faye Woods claims that though it\u0027s \u0026ldquodistressing emotionally to watch this play out on television, it\u0027s been valuable \u0026ldquoin terms of understanding and awareness of everyday behaviour. She adds: \u0026ldquoI think of all the people who may have dismissed coercive control, but then saw it in practice with Adam and Rosie and then understood it.  Then there\u0027s the issue of race. From the off it was not lost on black women writers and commentators such as Danielle Dash who noticed the way the statuesquely beautiful Samira Mighty \u0026ndash the only black woman in the house \u0026ndash was over-looked by all the boys and ended up with Alex because he\u0027d been usurped in his first choice by another man. On Friday, with another cohort of boys arriving in the villa resolutely uninterested in her, she finally broke down claiming to be \u0026ldquoso confused.  On the outside there is less confusion as people fit the pieces together. There\u0027s the way the public \u0026ldquoforgot to vote for singer Alexandra Burke, who outdanced all her competitors week after week on Strictly Come Dancing and repeatedly ended up in the dance off, the black girls passed over in dating show Take Me Out, the racist incidents in Big Brother House\u0027s gone by. Reality TV, argue many, has form.  Dr Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, hasn\u0027t watched it but isn\u0027t surprised by the concerns. \u0026ldquoReality TV is popular because it resonates with people, he says. \u0026ldquoSo we shouldn\u0027t be surprised when it replicates the racism that we see in society. Actually television often shows a world that is artificially equal. It\u0027s very rare now that something like Midsomer Murders \u0026ndash showing an all-white world \u0026ndash will be commissioned. So we sometimes get a distorted view when in actual fact the country is really segregated. In reality TV we see the reality that society is dominated by ideas of white supremacy.  It\u0027s not just the way the characters interact \u0026ndash it\u0027s also the way it\u0027s cast and edited, he claims. \u0026ldquoIf you look at who made the show, who picked the characters, who commissioned it in the first place, you\u0027ll probably find that it reflects a bias, he adds. \u0026ldquoThey [producers] should be mindful of that, more responsible. But fixing Love Island isn\u0027t going to do anything. It\u0027s a symptom of the problem.  Though unlikely to start viewing now, he admits it\u0027s probably more important than some give it credit for. It\u0027s certainly important to the millions of fans, following contestants\u0027 Instagram accounts in their droves, live-tweeting their own social commentary, or dissecting it with their mates on group chat. On Twitter there\u0027s support for Samira, complaints about Adam and other men\u0027s behaviour towards the women, and of course the inevitable backlash, calling out double standards. Discussion around the \u0026ldquosexual shaming of the women, when contestants were asked to share the number of people they\u0027d slept with, was red hot. On screen Laura\u0027s 30 was initially met with embarrassed silence, while Adam\u0027s 200 with backslapping.  Yet writing in the Times earlier this month Caitlin Moran claimed it is that interaction that makes Love Island an unlikely vehicle for feminism \u0026ldquobecause we live in an era when every one of the classic tactics used by these men \u0026ndash gaslighting, denial, coercion, guilt \u0026ndash is met with a fabulous deconstruction on social media. For the first time we have live, rolling footage of total ledges trying the kind of mindf***y shenanigans that previously have happened in the privacy of bars or the back of cabs ... That smirk! If you see a man smirk like that, leave immediately by the nearest exit, for you are dealing with a human trash-fire.  Online chat is also about spotting who is genuine (ie the loveable Dani Dyer and her boyfriend, stationery salesman Jack Fincham, whose loyalty during separation had hearts melting) and who is faking it. Who is merely playing the game? It\u0027s a rolling audience commentary that underlines the fact that just being young doesn\u0027t make you dumb.  As Faye Woods says: \u0026ldquoReality TV is never real, and all viewers know this. It is non-viewers who attempt to dismiss them as gullible. Reality TV is built for savvy, sophisticated viewers, who are able to pivot effortlessly between awareness of this as constructed process and an emotional immersion.  Paradise, then, might be a great way to switch off. But, it turns out, Paradise deconstructed might have plenty to tell us about our society and youth culture today, as long as we\u0027re ready to listen."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8004636.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iona-christian-community-in-final-bid-to-save-facilities","story":"              It is described as cradle of Christianity in Scotland.  In 563 AD the Irish monk, St Columba set up a monastic community on the tiny isle of Iona.  Since then it has become a haven for pilgrims, welcoming some 1,500 guests to its Hebridean shores every year.  However recently the fate of the historical abbey precinct has been plunged into doubt after the Christian group based on the island said it has veered dangerously into disrepair.  The Iona Community has said that years of heavy use have taken their toll on the residential facilities at the island\u0027s abbey, with a recent survey revealing that \"without some urgent repairs and long-term major investment, they would be unfit for purpose within seven years\".    It is now launching a final push of its Iona Abbey Capital project to help raise the last \u0026pound500,000 by the end of this year.  On its completion, the project will deliver improved access, new bedrooms and fully accessible shower rooms and toilets, as well as improved insulation and washing facilities at the centrer.  Current \u0026lsquoprivate\u0026rsquo spaces in Iona Abbey will also become accessible to the public as part of the project.  Reverend Kathy Galloway, the joint leader of the Iona Community, said the group had now completed phase one of the works, and now needed more help to fully fund phase two.  She said: \"We want to adapt the living areas to be accessible for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues.  \"We also want to install a renewable energy heating system and winter proof the building so that we can extend our season to welcome more visitors and volunteers each year. At the moment, many rooms are too cold to use past October.\"    Iona Abbey in 1953  Already, \u0026pound3 million has been raised for the project, including \u0026pound300,000 in the month of May alone.  Working in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and Iona Renewables, it also aims to provide a renewable energy heating system, through a progressive, community-led energy project.  The group said they are now in the position to begin phase two earlier than expected, which will lead to substantial savings, meaning the refurbished project will be ready to open a year early in 2020.  Reverend Galloway said: \"The Iona Community wants to continue to welcome people to share life in community for generations to come, and to make sure we are accessible for all.  \"This complex, exciting project will ensure people from around the world can continue to share in the community\u0026rsquos life within the historic setting and beauty of Iona,\" she said.  In 1938, the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona in order to rebuild the monastic quarters of the medieval abbey.  Set in the context of the poverty of the Depression, he brought together unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to serve as a sign of hopeful rebuilding of community in urban Scotland, aiming to rebuild \"the common life by working and living together, sharing skills and effort as well as joys and achievement\".  This has shaped the practice and principles of the group, which acts as an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Church engaged together.    Outside Iona Abbey in 1953  Since its completion in 1965, the monastery remains a centre for pilgrimage and tourism, with the community now running three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull.  Now, there is a year-round population of more than 100, including long-established island families as well as more recent arrivals, including those who work for the Iona Community in its centres as staff or volunteers.  Guests come to stay on the island to contemplate and pray, and play a significant role in the island\u0026rsquos economy.  Daily services of the Iona Community are undertaken in the Abbey church, with abbey itself managed by Historic Environment Scotland  Built of stone and slate, the buildings of the Iona Abbey Centre were originally the living quarters of the monks and have retained a distinctly monastic feel.  However, in a report sent to the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos general assembly two years ago, the Iona Community said that \"piecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs.\"  As of this year, both the Abbey Centre and the MacLeod centre -- a newer building on the island, have been closed to residential guests.  Reverend Galloway said the group was hopeful that \"people in Scotland and beyond will recognise the great need to safeguard Iona Abbey as a living place of hospitality, and ensure that thousands more people can visit this special place seeking sanctuary and inspiration\".    The Refectory  In 563AD, the Irish monk Columba (Columkille) established a monastic settlement on the island of Iona, leading to large parts of Scotland and the north of England to become evangelised.  As an important centre of European Christianity, it became the site of a Benedictine abbey in the Middle Ages and for centuries it has attracted thousands of people on their own pilgrim journeys.  The Abbey also has a substantial collection of stone crosses which date back to within 200 years of its founding, some of which show Celtic influences thought to come from Ireland.  The carved stones include St John\u0027s Cross and St Oran\u0027s Cross, and a cross slab created 100 years later.  The crosses are thought to be among the finest examples of such sculpture to survive.  Others bear the stamp of the Vikings who first raided Iona in 794 AD."},{"url":null,"title":"learner-drivers-should-have-to-spot-potholes-to-pass-test","story":"              Learner drivers should have to prove they can spot potholes to pass the test, according to a motoring firm.  The AA wants poor road surfaces to be included in the hazard perception test because of the damage they cause to vehicles.  It also called for advice on what to do when drivers encounter a pothole to be added to the Highway Code.  One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition as councils face a huge funding deficit to tackle potholes, a recent report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance warned.  Hazard perception is part of the theory driving test and involves candidates identifying something that would cause them to take action such as slow down or change direction in 14 video clips.  The pass rate of the practical driving test fell to a nine-year low of 45% after changes to make the exam more realistic were introduced in December last year.  The AA advises motorists who spot a pothole to:  - Slow down if necessary but keep an eye on the rear view mirror  - Stay in lane  - Avoid big swerves  A survey of a small sample of driving instructors found that the majority have broken down during a lesson at least once in the past 12 months because of pothole-related damage, and many have to adapt lessons to avoid certain roads where there are too many potholes.  Some learners have even had to abandon a practical driving test because their car was damaged by a pothole, the AA was told.  Damage to tyres, wheels and suspension are the most common problems.  AA president Edmund King said: \"It is a sad indictment of our poor road conditions that instructors are having to adapt their lessons to avoid potholed roads.  \"More troubling is the fact that lessons and tests are being abandoned because of pothole related breakdowns.  \"This is damaging to learners\u0027 confidence and to instructors whose livelihoods depend on having a fit-for-purpose road network and an undamaged car.  \"The situation is so serious that the hazard perception test and Highway Code need to change to reflect the state of the roads that learner drivers have to learn on.  \"There is no advice for drivers about potholes anywhere in the Highway Code yet it is one of the most common hazards they encounter.\"  Drivers are being urged to photograph potholes and send them to the responsible highway authority and the Department for Transport to demonstrate the scale of the issue as part of the AA\u0027s #FlagitFunditFillit campaign.  The Government said the DVSA keeps the driving test under constant review to make it as effective as possible.  It said in a statement: \"We have listened to the concerns of road users and are already providing councils in England with over \u0026pound6 billion to help improve the condition of our local highways.  \"This funding includes a record \u0026pound296 million through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around six million potholes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-business-secretary-hints-brexit-transition-period-could-be-extended-beyond-2020","story":"              THE Business Secretary has added to the tensions inside Theresa May\u0026rsquos divided cabinet by suggesting the post-Brexit transition may have to be extended.  Greg Clark said the status-quo period, which is due to end in December 2020, some 21 months after the UK formally leaves the EU, should be set by \u0026ldquofacts and evidence.  He suggested new computer systems and other border controls might not be ready by 2020.  On Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Mr Clark, who has said practical business concerns must come before ideology on Brexit, refused to rule out an extension.  He said: \"At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run [the port of Dover and Eurotunnel]... there are things that would need to be put in place, computer systems for example posts at the border, even if they checked, automatically number plates.  \"What we need assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice. It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.  His comments were echoed by Andrea Leadsom, who said 2020 was \u0026ldquonot a magical date.  The leader of the Commons said 2020 \u0026ldquoshould be long enough but \u0026ldquoremains under review.  She told told HuffPost UK: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos been agreed is the end of December 2020. And it\u0026rsquos not a magical figure, a magical date. It\u0026rsquos just what has been agreed with the EU.  \u0026ldquoI personally think it should be long enough. That\u0026rsquos my view. It\u0026rsquos fine as it is. We don\u0026rsquot need for any particular reason to extend it.  \u0026ldquoBut I think it remains under review. As all sides make very clear, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The idea of extending the period the UK in which maintains much of its relationship with the EU, while losing influence in Brussels, is an incendiary one for Brexiters, who fear it would postpone new trade deals and prolong freedom of movement, creating \u0026lsquoBrino\u0026rsquo, or Brexit in name only.  It is also likely to worsen the break-down in cabinet discipline ahead of this Friday\u0026rsquos crunch meeting at Chequers, where Mrs May hopes to finalise the UK blueprint for Brexit.  Brexiteers oppose the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.  However both options have been dismissed by the EU.  It emerged at the weekend that Brexiter Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically ripped up an official report suggesting he had come round to the customers partnership plan.  Asked if the customs partnership option was still on the table, Mr Clark said: \"Yes.\"  The chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, publicly pleaded for government unity.  Writing in the Observer, he said his party risked looking divided and letting in Labour.  He said: \u0026ldquoElectorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for divided parties. They rejected decisively the divided Tory party in 1997.  \u0026ldquoIf we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.  Damian Green, Mrs May\u0026rsquos former deputy, also attacked the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos fractious cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have seen threats against her, attacks on business, and cabinet ministers taking the proverbial out of each other\u0026rsquos policies. All of this in full public gaze. It has been an unedifying spectacle of oversized egos showing they are not fit to be officers.  Housing minister James Brokenshire admitted there were \u0026ldquostrong views on either side of the cabinet over Brexit, but he remained confident the Friday meeting at Chequers would end with a \u0026ldquoclear direction and a white paper published the week after.  There are now effectively only six weeks of negotiating time before the UK is supposed to agree a final deal on trade and other aspects of Brexit with the other 27 EU countries.  On Sky News, Jeremy Corbyn said he would be content with a longer transition period  Asked if he would accept it going past 2020, the Labour leader said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove got a feeling it might go beyond that\u0026hellip Yes."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8006151.jpg?type=article-full","title":"music-lovers-feel-the-heat-as-big-acts-turn-up-the-volume","story":"              Thousands of revellers soaked up the sunshine over the weekend as Glasgow played host to some of the biggest names in music.

Immature eggs have been shown for the first time in a laboratory to survive on ovarian tissue which was removed from cancer patients before treatment and stripped of cells, researchers said.  It is hoped this engineered structure could be re-implanted into women and restore fertility after they have completed chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Scientists from the Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen, Denmark, proved the graft worked when using human tissue transplanted into mice.  Experts said the research, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) annual meeting in Barcelona, \u0026ldquoholds much promise for the future.  Many cancer treatments can damage the ovaries, stopping the body from producing eggs and meaning a woman cannot get pregnant. Women dealing with a diagnosis can choose to have their eggs frozen, while some doctors may offer to remove or freeze all or part of an ovary so it can be transplanted back after treatment.  However, there is a small chance that grafted ovarian tissue could reintroduce cancer cells.  A \u0026ldquobio-engineered ovary would reduce this risk, the research team from Rigshospitalet said.  Their experiments used ovarian tissue removed from women trying to preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. The cells from the tissue were eliminated using chemicals, leaving behind a \u0026ldquobio-engineered scaffold on which the early-stage egg-containing follicles were reseeded.  Dr Susanne Pors, who presented the research, said: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularised human scaffold and, as a proof-of-concept, it could offer a new strategy in fertility preservation without risk of malignant cell recurrence.  Experiments in which the structure was transplanted into mice showed it could support the survival and growth of the follicles.  Commenting on the research, Professor Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women\u0026rsquos Clinic, said it was an \u0026ldquoexciting development.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove been able to show that they can then introduce back into that tissue stored follicles and early-growth eggs, that then appear to grow in that material that\u0026rsquos had all the cells removed, he said.  \u0026ldquoAnd, that this can then be placed back into the body and hopefully allow women to re-establish their cycles to possibly conceive, either naturally or with IVF, while reducing this risk of cancer.  He said the technique was \u0026ldquolikely to develop into something that will be potentially useful, but said further research was needed to prove it will work in humans.  Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said \u0026ldquoIf this is shown to be effective, it offers huge advantages over IVF and egg freezing."},{"url":null,"title":"loki-and-heseltine-to-headline-festival-of-politics","story":"              THE rapper Loki is to appear at this year\u0026rsquos Festival of Politics at the Scottish Parliament.

The Scottish Labour Women\u0026rsquos Movement (SLWM), which include MPs and MSPs, has formally raised the recent appointment of Jim Monaghan as a party organiser in Scotland.  Mr Monaghan, who was a spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign and believes the former Socialist MSP was the victim of a conspiracy, is being paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to promote \u0026ldquosocial change.  However his appointment has astonished Labour insiders who remember his work on behalf of Mr Sheridan, who was jailed for perjury in 2011.  Mr Sheridan successfully sued Rupert Murdoch\u0026rsquos News International in 2006 for \u0026pound200,000 after the former News of the World paper claimed he was a swinger and an adulterer.  However at a subsequent criminal trial a jury found he had lied under oath during his defamation action.  During both cases, Mr Sheridan labelled his many female accusers as liars, infuriating former colleagues.  The defamation case led to a split in the Scottish Socialists and Mr Sheridan forming his breakaway Solidarity party, which Mr Monaghan also joined.  The SLWM are now raising concerns about Mr Monaghan\u0026rsquos post with UK general secretary Jennie Formby and Scottish general secretary Brian Roy.  In social media messages, it said: \u0026ldquoThere is no political party that has achieved more for women than Labour but the inequalities and challenges still facing women and girls mean we need to work harder than ever to be their champion.

The win gives him a broad mandate to upend the political establishment and govern for the poor.  An official quick count from electoral authorities late on Sunday forecast that Mr Lopez Obrador would win with between 53% and 53.8% of the votes, a remarkable margin not seen in the country for many years.  Early on Monday, with about 40% of the votes counted, his advantage was close to the quick count\u0026rsquos statistical sample.  A prominent exit poll predicted that his party allies were poised to score big victories in congressional races, possibly winning absolute majorities in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.  Mr Lopez Obrador, who campaigned on vows to transform Mexico and oust the \u0026ldquomafia of power ruling the country, rode widespread voter anger and discontent with the governing Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, of President Enrique Pena Nieto and had led opinion polls since the beginning of the campaign.  The PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for nearly the entire 20th century and recaptured the presidency in 2012, was set to suffer heavy losses not just in the presidential race but in other polls as well.  In brief remarks at a hotel in central Mexico City, Mr Lopez Obrador called for reconciliation after a polarising campaign and promised profound change but with respect for the law and constitutional order.  \u0026ldquoI confess that I have a legitimate ambition: I want to go down in history as a good president of Mexico, he said, after losses in the previous two elections. \u0026ldquoI desire with all my soul to raise the greatness of our country on high.  The president-in-waiting, whose term will begin on December 1, devoted much of his speech to appealing to citizens of all stripes and seeking to reassure those who have eyed his candidacy nervously.  \u0026ldquoThis new national project will seek to establish an authentic democracy and we do not intend to establish a dictatorship, he said. \u0026ldquoThe changes will be profound, but in accordance with established order.  Conservative Ricardo Anaya, of a right-left coalition, and the PRI\u0026rsquos Jose Antonio Meade acknowledged defeat shortly after polls closed nationwide. The quick count had them on around 22% and 16% respectively.  Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos supporters began wild celebrations in Mexico City, cruising up and down the central Paseo de la Reforma boulevard honking horns to the tune of \u0026ldquoViva Mexico! and waving Mexican flags from car windows and sunroofs.  Thousands poured into the sprawling main square known as the Zocalo, where the 64-year-old former mayor of the capital had called on his backers to rally. Many danced to mariachi music.  Retired teacher Susana Zuniga beamed and said the country was experiencing a moment similar to the Mexican Revolution a century ago.  \u0026ldquoThe people are fed up. That is what brought us to this, she said.          Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!          \u0026mdash Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2018  US President Donald Trump tweeted congratulations: \u0026ldquoI look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!  Mr Lopez Obrador said individual and property rights would be guaranteed, promised respect for the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico and said his government will maintain financial and fiscal discipline.  He said contracts obtained under energy reforms passed under President Nieto will be scrutinised for any corruption or illegality, but otherwise contracts will be honoured.  \u0026ldquoThere will be no confiscation or expropriation of assets. \u0026hellip Eradicating corruption will be the principal mission, he said.  Mr Lopez Obrador also spoke of support for migrants and said the most forgotten and humble people of Mexico will be given preference in his government.  He said he will seek a relationship of \u0026ldquofriendship and respect with the United States. And rather than the use of force to fight spiralling violence, he will look to fix root causes such as inequality and poverty.  \u0026ldquoPeace and tranquility are the fruits of justice, he said.  Exit polling by Consulta Mitofsky for the Televisa network forecast wins for allies of Mr Lopez Obrador\u0026rsquos Morena party in at least four of eight state governor races on the ballot plus for the head of government in Mexico City. The central state of Guanajuato was expected to go to a candidate of the conservative National Action Party.  Mitofsky predicted Morena allies would take between 56 and 70 seats in the 128-member Senate and between 256 and 291 in the 500-seat lower house.  \u0026ldquoThe anger that the average Mexican feels toward the way things are being governed has favoured Lopez Obrador, said Shannon O\u0026rsquoNeil, senior fellow for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos been able to capture the mantle of the person who\u0026rsquos on the outside who wants change.  In a speech to the huge crowd in the Zocalo, he struck a moderate tone, stressing a need to act respectfully, to maintain economic and financial stability.  He also pledged to increase support payments for the elderly and to give scholarships or paid apprenticeships to young people.  \u0026ldquoNow that he has won, he cannot fail this new generation that believes in him, said Mariano Bartolini, a 29-year-old lawyer who voted for Mr Lopez Obrador in the north-western city of Rosarito, near Tijuana.  \u0026ldquoIt is thanks to us young people who are supporting him that he was able to get more votes than he did in past elections."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-university-appoints-new-principal","story":"              DUNDEE University has appointed Professor Andrew Atherton as its new principal.

During questions in the Commons, he asked the Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation what the UK Government is doing to increase the take-up of STEM subjects - guaranteeing a generation of well-equipped workers.        Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Monday 2 Jul 2018 6:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Monday 2 Jul 2018 6:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.            Addressing the audience, Kerr Okan, said: “Glasgow you look so good in the sunshine! Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd. This felt like a real tipping point performance that people will be talking about for years to come. A future TRNSMT headliner was born.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762402.1530517494!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith another referendum looms just so the snp keep power","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon will instigate another divisive vote for good or ill, all to keep her party in government, writes Brian Monteith.\t\t\t\tFor those that have not read my columns before, let me state what to others is obvious. I am a unionist with a lower case “u”.             By that I mean I am not committed to any one unionist party and am willing to give non-unionist parties a fair hearing if they apply liberal, low tax, small government policies in Scotland, because I believe these are what will most likely deliver as harmonious and prosperous a Scotland for the vast majority of its people as is practicably possible.            Nor do I support unionism because I think an independent Scotland could not succeed one just has to look at other smaller countries to see that if Denmark or Norway can do well then surely so could Scotland – if it lived within its means.No, I am unionist because I am at home with being Scottish and British. It was in my mother’s milk that I suckled on it was in my rearing through infancy and schooldays and my travelling around the UK as a youth and then an undergraduate. I have rejoiced in our rich and diverse cultural history during my British holidays, just as I enjoy the internal home nations’ rivalries or competition between Scotland’s cities or the Highlands and Lowlands. I can see the good in them and the faults in them, but I do see and feel a tangible unifying oneness, a bond that I cannot let go of.So when I see the bitter divisions that came out of the first independence referendum – the splitting of families, the loss of friends and the rising tide of implied or discreet threats, sometimes with genuine menace – then I fear what another independence referendum could do to our country. At the age of 60 this year, I do not think the psychological wounds of 2014 will be healed before I leave this Earth – were there to be a second referendum then I have absolutely no doubt it will be ugly and the scarring divisions that much greater. Yet I have to tell you I also believe there will be another and it will not be pretty, and whatever the outcome it will need real leadership to bring about a healing. Sadly, there are few leaders of any humility or calibre that I think could achieve such a highly desirable role.I believe there will be another independence referendum because all the signs point to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wishing and now needing it to be so, and for good or ill she will instigate it.             The original SNP strategy was that if, when in government, it could show a SNP-run Scotland was no worse or maybe even slightly better than the Labour-Liberal Democrat administrations before, then independence might not seem such an undesirable leap. On many issues this meant the SNP actually did very little it promised for instance, the council tax was not abolished in favour of a local income tax, nor were students loans written off.When in 2011 the SNP won its overall majority it still did not seek to frighten the horses for fear of losing potential supporters for independence. Other than centralising institutions (under the mistaken guise of saving money), public service reform was studiously avoided. Scotland was in stasis while the independence White Paper, Scotland’s Future, was published, and following the 55-45 defeat no ­serious public service reform has followed.The SNP is essentially averse to challenging the vested interests in health and education, for to do so must force some people to be against them when they need to build a coalition for Yes (or more likely “Leave”) the second time round.After 11 years of SNP government we are therefore at a point where, under its watch, education is much worse with falling numeracy and literacy and collapsing international rankings expose the truth of this the Scottish NHS too is failing with the worst cancer treatment times in history and four health boards now requiring emergency loans totalling over £70 million just to get by meanwhile the iconic Queensferry Crossing yet again requires further remedial work that will disrupt traffic all summer and our public roads now have more craters than the surface of the Moon.             These are just some examples, for when you turn over any Scottish Government stone the problems come crawling out like clipshears and wood lice.Last week Sturgeon had a shambolic ministerial reshuffle that was bad on two counts. Firstly, she appointed a narcissist tweeter with a criminal conviction as Justice Secretary, when the role requires a solemn and judicious politician with a character, like Caesar’s wife, that is beyond suspicion. Secondly she not only retained her financial secretary, Derek Mackay, who has presided over a growing black hole that no quantum physicist can explain, she actually added to his brief. Ultimately this void will swallow up her government. Then she retained her Education Secretary, John Swinney, when by the evidence of his own inactions he has utterly failed to deliver the necessary reforms for what is claimed to be her “number one priority” of schooling.That was before the wheels came of the reshuffle tea trolley with the withdrawal of Gillian Martin as education minister.             The strategy for a second independence referendum was originally to use any and every grievance with Westminster – and where none existed, to create some – so momentum for a referendum could then be held. That is clearly not working. Nor by 20,000 leagues is the original model of demonstrating competence.All that is now left is for Sturgeon to take us into a second referendum – with or without Westminster’s necessary legal consent – so she can polarise the country and thus galvanise personal support to have any chance of the SNP remaining the largest party after the next Holyrood elections in 2021.Glorious victory – or more likely, glorious defeat whatever the cost to Scotland – is worth it if it means remaining in control of government. No longer is a second referendum about winning independence, it is about retaining power. Scotland will be thrown to the wolves to whip up division so in the aftermath disappointed supporters will flock to the SNP. Sturgeon cares not for the country’s harmony, prosperity or public services – she cares only for the SNP being in position to have a third tilt at independence.Such is the sorry state of our nation.

An action plan published by the Scottish Government says shops should be stopped from providing “triggers” that encourage customers to indulge in food high in fat, salt and sugar.            Around a fifth of the average Scottish person’s daily calorie intake comes from so-called “discretionary foods” with little or no nutritional value, it adds. READ MORE: Scots toddlers eat a million sweets a weekThe plans will be set out in more detail in the autumn ahead of a public consultation, but the document sets out a number of ways in which the issue is likely to be tackled. READ MORE: In Pictures: 16 sweets you’ll remember if you grew up in ScotlandAs well as banning multi-buy deals on unhealthy foods, restrictions could also be placed on unlimited refills of sugary drinks and the offer of incentives such as a free toy or loyalty points.             Lunchtime meal deals, which see shoppers encouraged to buy a drink and crisps or snack alongside a sandwich for a fixed price, could also come to an end as a result of the plans. However, the action plan says restrictions will only apply to foods with “little or no essential nutrients”, meaning that popular foods such as pizzas may escape the ban. Being overweight or obese ‘the norm’ The document warns that being overweight or obese is now “the norm” for Scottish adults, with almost two-thirds (65 per cent) in this category – a figure largely unchanged in the last decade.             It says Scots live increasingly sedentary lifestyles and are “bombarded” by messages encouraging them to eat unhealthily, adding that simply relying on people to change their habits themselves is not enough. It proposes the creation of an advertising code of practice which would restrict junk food advertising at bus shelters, train stations and on public transport. The new strategy also focuses on children and early years, with plans for a pre-conception campaign to encourage women to start pregnancy at a health weight. “Far too many people in Scotland face serious risks to their health linked to poor diet and unhealthy weight,” said public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick. “This is unacceptable and it’s largely avoidable. Scotland has a proud history of taking decisive action on public health and this is the next step in that journey.”             The plans were welcomed by healthy eating campaigners, but Cancer Research UK said it was “vital” that they led to enforceable laws so supermarkets were compelled to take action. The Scottish Conservatives also welcomed what it described as a “U-turn” from ministers on banning two-for-one pizza deals. “That was ill-thought through and would have hit families simply trying to buy an affordable meal that adults and children can enjoy,” said the party’s health spokesman Miles Briggs.This story first appeared on our sister site iNews."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4756593.1530551056!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s weather heatwave set to continue this week","story":"\t\tAfter last week\u0026#8217s record-breaking temperatures, the warm weather shows no signs of disappearing any time soon\t\t\t\tBy the end of last week, Scots had been basking in high temperatures of 31.9 C (91.4F) - coming close to the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland which was the incredible 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.window.twttr = (function(d, s, id) {            It was the driest June on record in south-east and central southern England, with just 6% of expected rainfall across counties like Essex and Dorset, the Met Office said.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.
