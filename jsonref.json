Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor          I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’d have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi! Hayi! HAYI!(That’s Xhosa for ‘What a great idea!’) "},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice star Karren Brady come clean Philip Greens gagging orders say MPs","story":"      Lady Brady with her daughter Sophia, 22, who works as a social media content assistant and part-time model for Topshop.

Theresa May (left) has a breakfast meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) at the EU-League of Arab States Summit in  Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Amid a bitter standoff the PM has admitted a final vote on her Brexit plan could be delayed until just 17 days before the EU exit dateThe issue of postponing Brexit came up \u0027fleetingly\u0027 during the discussions between Mrs May and Mrs Merkel this morning, according to Downing Street. But a spokesman said the PM simply repeated that she wanted the UK to leave with a deal on March 29. Speaking at a press conference to close the summit, Mr Tusk said: \u0027Prime Minister May and I discussed yesterday a lot of issues including the legal and procedural context of a potential extension. \u0027For me it is absolutely clear that (if) there is no majority in the House of Commons to approve a deal, we will face an alternative - chaotic Brexit or extension. \u0027The less time there is until March 29, the greater the likelihood of an extension. \u0027This is an objective fact, not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact. Cue ridicule!

An amendment tabled by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Oliver Letwin - to be put to a vote on Wednesday - would force Mrs May to seek an extension if a deal has not been approved by MPs by March 13.Ms Cooper, a former Labour minister, said on Monday it would allow Parliament to tell the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the negotiation process but leave it in the Government\u0027s hands to decide how long it should be.Mrs May could seek to take matters into her own hands as early as tomorrow when she makes a Commons statement.This could theoretically see off a rebellion by Remain-supporting MPs and ministers who are threatening to back Cooper-Letwin.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested there was a possibility of Mrs May herself announcing an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process beyond March 29.Mr Ellwood told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027The Prime Minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.\u0027Go long The EU is said to favour a longer delay, possibly up to 21 months.Plans being considered in Brussels would see the transition period due to follow on if the UK leaves with a deal replaced by staying in the EU proper, the Guardian reported. This would allow for deeper talks on the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the aim of making the Irish border backstop - the main sticking point in the drawn-out negotiations - redundant.The possibility of extending Article 50 was raised when May met with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Egypt. Nuclear optionBritain could unilaterally reverse Article 50 and stay in the EU until the deal is done. A European court ruled last year that this can be done by the UK without seeking consent from other EU states, whereas extending the Article 50 period would require agreement from the other 27 capitals. But it would also be likely to see Brexiteers in Mrs May\u0027s party explode with rage and could speed up her demise.                            Mrs May met European Union Council President Donald Tusk, right, on the sidelines of the summit yesterday          Prime Minister Theresa May is hugged by the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko BorissovBut she refused to criticise the rebel trio and ducked questions about whether the fragile state of her Government made the ministers \u0027unsackable\u0027.Mrs May said: \u0027Collective responsibility has not broken down. What we\u0027ve seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That\u0027s not a surprise to anybody.\u0027We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire to actually ensure we leave the EU with a deal. That\u0027s what we\u0027re working for, that\u0027s what I\u0027m working for.\u0027We\u0027ve been having positive talks with the EU. As you know we were in Brussels last week, my team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be returning to Brussels this Tuesday.    If the backbench motion is passed, Mrs May would have until March 13 to get her plan through Parliament or be forced to seek a delay in the process          Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels\u0027As a result of that we won\u0027t bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that happens by March 12. It is still within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on March 29. And that\u0027s what we\u0027re working to do.\u0027Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith last night said that by delaying the meaningful vote, Mrs May was effectively \u0027calling the bluff\u0027 of the Cabinet rebels.\u0027They are smashing the whole concept of government,\u0027 he said.

Another Labour MP, Louise Ellman, is on the brink of leaving after more than 50 years.A friend said: \u0027Louise will not be in the party for much longer.\u0027The third MP, Siobhain McDonagh, said on Friday she had decided not to resign \u0027this week\u0027 – meaning a decision to go could come soon.Dame Margaret, a former minister who has faced months of abuse from hard-Left activists, said: \u0027This is the final wake-up call for Jeremy Corbyn. The leadership has so lost trust but I don\u0027t believe any of the figures they come out with on the cases they\u0027ve dealt with. I\u0027ve had pretty horrific abuse on Twitter. It absolutely doesn\u0027t feel to me like there is zero tolerance on anti-Semitism.\u0027 Dame Louise said: \u0027I am still fighting with the party\u0027s failure to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027An unpublished Labour Party report into Dame Louise\u0027s Liverpool Riverside constituency found she was physically threatened by one member and \u0027there have been CLP meetings during which anti-Semitic incidents are alleged to have taken place\u0027.The report said: \u0027These have arisen as a result of \u0027obsessive interrogations\u0027 of the MP over the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some members have felt that others are holding the MP – a Jewish woman – personally accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.\u0027The 11 members of the Independent Group will meet today to discuss organisation, including how to elect a leader. Yesterday Chuka Umunna called on voters to \u0027join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics\u0027.A poll for The Observer puts the group\u0027s support at 6 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems. It has also emerged that Sir David Garrard, once one of Labour\u0027s biggest donors, is supporting the new group.                         Tom Watson said Mr Corbyn had to \u0027change very, very rapidly\u0027 to stop more MPs from following the nine who quit the party last week.He also revealed he had handed the party leader a dossier of 50 cases where no adequate action had been taken over racist comments on social media about Jewish iniduals.In a TV interview, he demanded Mr Corbyn take personal charge of rooting out anti-Semitism because the \u0027party machine\u0027 had failed. And he urged him to change tack on Brexit and push for a second referendum.\u0027The departure of our colleagues is a real blow, and we need to understand why they felt the need to go. Because if we\u0027re going to be in government we need to address those concerns.\u0027For us to hold this party together, things have to change. There\u0027s almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party now. I absolutely fear that we will lose more parliamentary colleagues. We may lose peers from the House of Lords, and we may lose members and councillors and I don\u0027t want that to happen.\u0027Mr Watson said Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who left for the Independent Group last week, had been \u0027bullied out of the Labour Party by a small number of racist thugs\u0027 and he was \u0027very very sad to see her go\u0027.Hard-Left activists, he said, were causing irreparable harm by \u0027pouncing\u0027 on MPs, and bullying them on social media. Details of the anti-Semitism dossier, seen by the Mail, show it included vicious racist abuse. One said of Jewish Labour MPs: \u0027I don\u0027t know what runs through their veins, not human blood.\u0027Mr Watson said Labour general secretary Jenny Formby\u0027s attempts to combat anti-Semitism had \u0027very patently not been adequate\u0027 and Mr Corbyn should take a personal lead.On Brexit, he said Mr Corbyn needed to \u0027reunify our party\u0027 and move towards a second referendum.He also called for more centrist Labour MPs to be given jobs on the front bench and said he was going to set up a new \u0027social democratic\u0027 group of moderates to develop policies. In an interview with Sky News on Friday night, Mr Corbyn said he did not believe bullying existed in Labour on a wide scale.When confronted with quotes from prominent Jews accusing him of not doing enough, he said there were \u0027very many other people in the Jewish community\u0027 who were happy.A Labour Party spokesman said: \u0027The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.

The Independent Group, consisting of eight former Labour MPs and three ex-Tories, met for the first time on Monday in the very plush surroundings of a Westminster  conference venue popular with politicians          Luton MP Gavin Shuker was flanked by Heidi Allen (left) and Luciana Berger at the first meeting at One Great George Street in WestminsterThey were joined in the following days by an eighth Labour MP and a trio of dispirited Tories who walked out on Theresa May in horror at what Brexit was doing to her party.The TIG members were all smiles as they posed for pictures in One Great George Street, with the three former Tories spread out on three of the four sides of the table, flanked by their more left-wing colleagues.Luton South MP Gavin Shuker appeared to be in the central seat, flanked by Liverpool Wavertree\u0027s Luciana Berger and South Cambridgeshire\u0027s Heidi Allen as they posed for pictures before the meeting went ahead behind closed doors.Tom Watson makes direct challenge to Corbyn as he sets up...Momentum chief warns TIGs are a threat to Labour amid...Share this article    Broxtowe MP Anna Soubry sitting with Ilford MP Mike Gapes.

Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor          I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’d have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi!

They were inseparable, and when they were apart they corresponded using ‘fanciful’ names. Sarah was Mrs Freeman and Anne, Mrs Morley.Later, Churchill was second favourite in Anne’s affections by a cousin of hers, Abigail Hill. She had caught the Queen’s attention during Sarah’s frequent absences from Court, and the Duchess was never again to be the Queen’s closest confidant.The United Kingdom of Great Britain was created during her reign by the Union of England and Scotland. Britain became a major military power and the foundations were laid for the 18th century’s Golden Age during her reign.She died after suffering a stroke on Sunday 1st August 1714 at the age of 49. Credit: historic-uk.com                                                       The new queen of Hollywood!

This month alone, we have seen the New York Times note the “striking” similarities between AJ Finn’s bestselling mystery The Woman in the Window and a self-published novel released two years before, a romance writer who blamed her ghostwriter for copying passages from other writers’ books, and Australian author Nick Milligan pointing out the common features in his novel Enormity and Danny Boyle’s forthcoming film Yesterday.In 2006, Ian McEwan was forced to defend himself from claims he had plagiarised the work of Lucilla Andrews’ autobiography in his novel Atonement. In 2007, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh failed to prove that Dan Brown’s novel The Da Vinci Code copied their earlier non-fiction work The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. And last summer, a judge dismissed a lawsuit from Emma Cline’s ex-boyfriend, who alleged her debut novel The Girls infringed his copyright.Solomon says the Society is often contacted by authors complaining that another has pilfered an idea. “Some cases are absolutely straightforward, but legal action is very tricky in cases which don’t concern actual language copying but rely on copying of themes, plots or structure. They’re expensive to take, they depend on line-by-line checking of work and unfortunately many authors don’t have the funds to go against large publishing or film companies to take action with no guarantee of success.”It has long been claimed that there are somewhere between three and 36 basic plots in all forms of storytelling. Three years ago, academics fed nearly 2,000 stories into a computer analysis and concluded that there were six “core trajectories” for all stories. None of these common plots, however, include a character called Jack who passes off the Beatles’ music as his own on another planet (Milligan’s Enormity and Boyle’s new film), or an alcoholic, agoraphobic woman who watches a crime play out in the house opposite her own (Finn’s bestseller and British author Sarah A Denzil’s Saving April).Milligan told  Australia last week that he felt the similarities were “probably just a horrible coincidence and they mean me no disrespect”. As for Finn and Denzil, the similarities came to light this month after the New Yorker ran an exposé about Finn, a pseudonym for the publisher Dan Mallory, who has a history of lying about his professional history and health, including a brain cancer diagnosis.Finn’s thriller was published in January 2018 Denzil’s novel was self-published in March 2016. Reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have pointed out the similarities between the two books for months. “Almost the same thing” says one Goodreads reviewer on Saving April. “Seems so similar to Girl in the Window. Feels like I just read a different version of that,” runs an Amazon review of Denzil’s book.The New York Times recently noted the parallels between the two being “numerous, and detailed”. And they are (spoilers ahead): both centre on a woman who has lost a child and partner through a car accident for which she blames herself, a fact that isn’t at first revealed. Both feature a new family moving in opposite, whom the agoraphobe watches. She becomes convinced the husband is abusing the wife and befriends their adopted teenager who, after gaining her trust, turns out to be the villain.Denzil, real name Sarah Dalton, told the  she had noticed the similarities herself when she read The Woman in the Window. She said she started writing Saving April in October 2015, submitting it to Amazon’s Kindle Scout programme, which displayed a sample of text from the novel, the blurb and the cover on its website in December 2015. It went on to Amazon as a pre-order and was published on 29 March 2016.The New Yorker profile identified another work similar to The Woman in the Window: the 1995 film Copycat, starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. The film and the novel both see a psychologist become trapped in her home by agoraphobia, drink too much, be mistrusted by the police and join a forum that turns out to be dangerous. The director of Copycat, Jon Amiel, told the New Yorker that the debt was “not actionable, but certainly worth noting, and one would have hoped that the author might have noted it himself”.Mallory himself has been open about being inspired by other works, including Gillian Flynn, Kate Atkinson and the Hitchcock film Rear Window, which he says he had just finished watching when the idea came to him. But both Mallory’s literary agent and his publisher have said that the outline of The Woman in the Window, including characters and main plot points, was fully formed by 20 September 2015, before Saving April was released. Mallory submitted a 7,500 word outline that day – a month before Denzil began writing her novel.When the New York Times published its story about Saving April, Mallory’s lawyer allowed a Times reporter to look at the outlines the author sent to his agent on 20 September and 4 October. “Some of the overlapping plot points, including the fact that both protagonists were fighting with their husbands about infidelity before the car crashes, and that the psychopathic teenager tortured animals, while not in the original outline, were contained in the October version … Mr Mallory’s attorney said Mr Mallory has never read Saving April,” said the paper, in an addition to its original story.Solomon said: “It’s bound to happen to an extent, but sometimes things go over the line.” She won’t comment on particular cases, but advises all writers to document every source and submission of their work from the earliest stage possible.“That can help if you want to take action but also protects authors when it is alleged that they have copied others. It also protects you from inadvertently copying an idea by forgetting that you picked it up elsewhere and thinking it was original to you,” she adds. “Much copying is unconscious – though that is no defence.”TS Eliot had it that “immature poets imitate mature poets steal” – a line once echoed by Mallory. “It is often said that ‘good writers borrow, great writers steal’,” he told the Observer in 2018. “If I had not read the work of Flynn or Atkinson I wouldn’t have written the book I did.”Or, as Twain put it in his letter to Keller: “substantially all ideas are second-hand”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953d0c6936d26dcc513963b13c0737644bb7ad5b/0_863_3557_2134/master/3557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46176e645e604c15b8cce2df4aac7b57","title":"if only i could tell you by hannah beckerman review","story":"If there’s one group of professionals more indebted to the unhappy family than psychiatrists, it’s novelists. In the case of the Siskins,the clan at the heart of Hannah Beckerman’s resolutely heartbreaking second novel, familial dysfunction has long since ossified into estrangement. Yet in a complex, cruel twist, their acrimony will turn out to flow from the very lifeblood of every happy family’s tale: love.Jess and Lily are chalk-and-cheese sisters, one an artsy single mum struggling to meet her mortgage repayments, the other a high-powered ceiling-smasher whose life resembles a sleek photo-shoot. Though their west London homes are just three miles apart and their daughters the same age, it’s been 15 years since they last saw one another and nearly three decades since they’ve properly spoken. But now their mother, Audrey, is gravely ill with just months to live, she is desperate to see her girls reconciled.Though romance sparks and infidelity combusts on these pages, this is a very grownup novel, its focus firmly on platonic familial bonds that, as Beckerman shows, can have infinitely more devastating effects than anything Cupid might tie. It’s a very female novel, too, without any of the twee cosiness that description so often connotes. Switching between its trio of distinct viewpoints, the narrative toggles back and forth in time, compelling each woman in turn to re-examine her memories of the moment when things went so wrong for their family, in the summer of 1988.Meanwhile, melding her peace-making mission with a bucket list inspired by a diary entry written on her 16th birthday, Audrey takes up life drawing, joins a choir and jets off to New York. That might make If Only I Could Tell You sound breezy – it’s not. Having set the clock ticking, journalist and critic Beckerman moves the narrative along at a determined pace, tapping pop-culture references for flashback atmosphere (think Rick Astley, Grange Hill and Wagon Wheels) and eschewing overly fussy imagery in favour of clipped precision. Without the padding of extraneous scene-setting, her psychological acuity becomes all the more winding. And somehow, in a plot galvanised by guilt, grief and tragic misunderstandings, quieter observations, such as the pained push-pull dynamic of the parent-teen relationshipor the fathomless depth of feeling that’s conveyed by the touch of a maternal hand , become just as unravelling.This shares much with novels that find themselves stuffed into that faddy, baggy subgenre we’re encouraged to call “up-lit’. Fortunately, its commitment to the unhappy family is such that even as Audrey is visited by bittersweet epiphanies, there’s a rich and lingering melancholy. “There were as many different beginnings to a life as someone was brave and kind enough to allow themselves,” she finally learns. It’s 11th-hour wisdom and all the truer for it.• If Only I Could Tell You is published by Orion (14.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

She is widely referred to as the “first lady of football” for her quarter-of-a-century career running Birmingham City and then West Ham United. A supporter of David Cameron and George Osborne, the 49-year-old is one of just 206 women in the House of Lords (out of a total of 783 peers).She has also famously advised Lord Sugar on The Apprentice, as well as Simon Cowell and the former pornographer David Sullivan. It was Sullivan who gave Brady her first big break in 1993 when she convinced him to buy Birmingham City out of receivership. He installed her as chief executive when she was just 23, but told her she would have to be twice as good as a man to run the club, to which Brady replied: “Well that’s not difficult.”During her first press conference at Birmingham, she was asked for her vital statistics. And early on at the club, a player commented: “I can see your tits in that shirt.” Brady replied: “Well, don’t worry, when I sell you to Crewe you won’t be able to see them from there, will you?”. Three days later she sold him. “It was the best deal I ever did,” she told the  last year.She moved to West Ham, where she is vice-chair under the owners Sullivan and David Gold. Rumours have suggested she is actually an Arsenal supporter, but Brady’s website says she “is not an Arsenal fan, and her footballing loyalties have only ever lay with the two clubs she has represented”.Brady grew up in Edmonton, north London, near Tottenham Hotspur’s ground. Her Irish father, Terry, was a self-made Rolls-Royce-driving millionaire, having worked in property and printing. Her Italian mother, Rita, was a full-time mum. She was sent to an all-girls’ Catholic boarding school, which she hated. “You do what you’re told, you wear what you’re told, you eat what you’re told, you go to bed when you’re told,” she said last year. “I was sick of being told what to do. The one thing I wanted was independence. And I realised to have that independence, you needed financial independence.” After passing nine O-levels, she left to join the sixth form of a former all-boys’ school – one of only six girls.A lifelong Conservative supporter, Brady introduced the then chancellor George Osborne at the Tory party conference in 2013. She was subsequently appointed as the government’s small business ambassador. A year later she became a Conservative life peer. “I think it’s a bit like any industry that has never marketed itself to women,” she has said of politics. “A bit like football.”At the same time she built up a series of business interests, including in 2017 accepting Sir Philip Green’s offer to become chair of his family’s Taveta Investments company, which owns Arcadia Group including the Topshop and Miss Selfridge brands. Her brief was to “beef up corporate oversight” and “sort out” corporate governance issues.As a vocal campaigner for women in business, Brady has come under increasing pressure to speak out over allegations of racial and sexual harassment made against Green. He denies the allegations. Dragons Den’s Duncan Bannatyne has described her continued employment at Taveta as “disgusting”.Two weeks ago Brady said she would stay at the company out of duty to Arcadia’s employees, including her daughter Sophia Peschisolido, who is a model. “I hope you would agree that walking away is the easy thing to do staying in the role and ensuring the company is robust going forward is much harder,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8be978a8f6ed57b13dff37fd1ec3a332a0f8923e/0_161_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12e04702fdd5ad1eeb67e14aedd7bddb","title":"persimmon profits help to buy scheme","story":"Builder sparks controversy with massive gains from taxpayer-funded programmeThe housebuilder Persimmon made more than £1bn profit last year thanks largely to the taxpayer-funded help-to-buy scheme, through which almost half of its homes were sold.Persimmon’s gains from the help-to-buy scheme, in which the government provides a guaranteed interest-free loan, have sparked a ministerial review. James Brokenshire, the housing minister, is said to be “increasingly concerned by the behaviour of Persimmon”.A source close to the minister said: “Given that contracts for the 2021 extension to help-to-buy are being reviewed shortly, which overall is a great scheme helping hundreds of thousands of people into home ownership, it would be surprising if Persimmon’s approach wasn’t a point of discussion.”A government spokesman said officials would “carefully” examine the vast profits made by Persimmon and other housebuilders. “Help-to-buy will look different,” the spokesman said. “We’ve already said it will look only at first-time buyers and we will definitely not be funding leasehold properties. We will look carefully at developer performance over recent years.”Persimmon also announced that its interim chief executive, Dave Jenkinson, has been appointed to the role permanently. Jenkinson has been interim boss since Fairburn was asked to leave the firm in November after outrage over his bonus, which was reduced from £110m to £75m. The company said the payout, which sparked widespread public and political anger, had become a “distraction”.Jenkinson, who had previously been managing director, collected a bonus worth £40.5m from the same long-term incentive plan. The bonus scheme, believed to be the most generous ever from a FTSE 100 company, paid out about £500m worth of shares to 150 senior staff.Fairburn has failed to set up a charity more than a year after pledging to do so in an attempt to assuage public and political anger at his bonus. He has not registered a charity with the Charity Commission or made any inquiries about how to set one up, despite saying he would donate a “substantial proportion” of his bonus to a charitable trust.Persimmon’s annual results published on Monday reveal that 7,970 of the 16,449 homes it sold last year were bought with the assistance of the help-to-buy scheme. That is an increase on 7,682 in the previous year. Total home sales were £3.74bn, up from £3.6bn in 2017. The company said it had orders for a further £2bn worth of homes.Jenkins said Persimmon’s large profits “reflect our successful focus on offering attractively priced new homes primarily to the first-time buyer and first-time mover markets, where housing need is greatest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af1b0e961385b4b39a947eb0d8337b2f28d25139/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a2a63a9191f872c22a498d456e868fd","title":"pound brexit delay reports mark carney jerome powell business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as sterling rallies and Bank of England governor Mark Carney faces MPsTreasury committee chair Nicky Morgan brings up another important issue - ersity at the Bank of England.She reminds Mark Carney that he told the Bank’s Court that there was a particular problem with retaining ethnic minority staff, who are underrepresented at every level of the central bank.Morgna also cites a report in the Times last week that BAME staff were more critical of the Bank’s culture -- citing inappropriate language and behaviour, and problems in progressing within the Bank.BAME employees perceived a lack of transparency in hiring and firing, and were critical of the Bank’s narrow recruitment base.This is not good.Carney replies that the Bank management take the issue of ersity seriously, and have made considerable progress.But, he also concedes that the experience for BAME colleagues is “notably different, notably worse, than for other colleagues”.“We’re not satisfied with the progress made. It’s not just about numbers.Governor Mark Carney adds that the Bank will provide ‘all the stimulus it can’ if Britain leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal.Interest rates could either rise or fall in that scenario, he adds, pointing out that a no-deal Brexit will probably be inflationary (as the pound would surely plunge, pushing up import costs).Q: Is the Bank of England more likely to raise, or lower, interest rates after a no-deal Brexit, asks Nicky Morgan MP.It’s clear that the Bank’s top policymakers are split on this issue.MPC member Gertjan Vleighe argues that borrowing costs won’t go up. He tells the Treasury committee that the shock to consumer confidence will be so severe that the Bank will either leave policy unchanged, or cut rates.Deputy governor Dave Ramsden isn’t convinced, though. He fears a supply-shock if Britain crashes out of the EU, with port disruption making imports scarcer. That would drive up inflation, as businesses and consumers scrapped for goods.Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee now.And he’s started with some news -- the Bank is preparing to pump more liquidity into the UK financial system if needed.With Brexit tensions mounting, the Bank will now hold liquidity auctions every week, rather than monthly, from the start of March until the end of April.Carney tells the committee that this is a prudent and precautionary move. It will allow around 100 banks and building societies to get extra cash in all major currencies, in return for handing the BoE eligible collateral (a range of financial securities).This would be valuable if the financial system seized up after a disorderly Brexit, and the City found it couldn’t Carney insists that the Bank isn’t seeing any liquidity stresses in the market, and that the move is part of “normal contingency planning”.Carney is appearing along with deputy governor Dave Ramsden and monetary policy committee members Jan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. We’ll watch out for any major developments.Just in: The richest households in the UK saw their income grow last year, while the poorest families got poorer.That’s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has published new income distribution data this morning.The pound is holding onto its earlier gains, still trading at a one-month high against the euro (at €1.158)  and the US dollar ($1.316).Michael Brown, senior analyst at currency exchange firm Caxton FX, says the prospect of a Brexit extension is supporting sterling:The pound’s gains are a result of markets beginning to price in an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, with reports this morning that the Prime Minister is set to discuss the matter with Cabinet before laying a motion in the Commons this afternoon.Though a delay is simply pushing back the exit date, and doesn’t solve anything itself, markets are taking solace in the fact that such a move would delay a ‘cliff-edge’ no-deal scenario. Confirmation of such a delay would likely strengthen the pound further in the near-term, though political headwinds remain including the opposition Labour Party calling for a 2nd Brexit referendumIn a worrying example of Brexit non-planning, Britain doesn’t have the right sort of pallets to keep trading with the EU if it leaves without a deal.According to Business Insider, the UK government is due to hold emergency talks with industry leaders today after discovering this hitch.The problem is that the EU insists that all pallets entering the bloc from third-countries are heat-treated, to prevent any nasty pests or microbes getting in.That’s not a requirement today (on the grounds that EU countries have similar biological life). So there’s going to be an unseemly scramble for any scarce certified pallets soon, unless Brexit is delayed or Theresa May’s deal is voted through.BI’s Adam Payne says this has come as a nasty shock to the government.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has arranged for a conference call with various figures to take place on Tuesday to discuss the alarming pallet shortage, with just 31 days until Brexit day on March 29.“It is the tiny, procedural, mundane-seeming stuff that will absolutely trip people up,” one industry figure briefed by Theresa May’s government told BI, adding that the country was “not even remotely ready” for no-deal.There’s really no excuse for DEFRA not spotting the pallet issue earlier. Last October, Universal Pallets warned that this issue would cause delays for exporters, as it takes time to heat-treat pallets and get them stamped.Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is urging the government to take a no-deal Brexit off the table.Marshall warns that many UK companies - and the government itself - simply aren’t ready for a disorderly exit.“At this pivotal moment, the government must take decisive steps to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit would cause to business and the economy in just a month’s time. “It is time to be honest. Government and its agencies are not prepared for a ‘no deal’ exit on 29th March. Neither are many businesses. “The overriding priority must be to assure businesses, employees, investors and communities that an unwanted ‘no deal’ scenario will not be allowed to happen by default on March 29th.”Two weeks ago, the Bank of England reported that HALF UK companies hasn’t drawn up contingency plans for no-deal....The CBI’s chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, has warned MPs that they need to use any Brexit delay wisely:Bullish traders are piling into the pound this morning, lured by the prospect of a Brexit delay, says Neil Wilson of Markets.Sterling has rallied on movements in the political space that have encouraged the bulls. First, Labour is now backing a second referendum - one u-turn. If anything, though, this just hints at the party worrying about an exodus to The Independent Group. Secondly, and more importantly, there appears to be building pressure on the prime minister to take no deal off the table - another u-turn.If no deal is abandoned, it would likely entail a delay to Brexit, and whilst assuaging concerns about crashing out without a deal in place, it would not remove all the uncertainty. A key cabinet meeting today will reveal all – we hope. Ouch. UK engineering services group Babcock has warned the City that Brexit will cost it millions of pounds, every year.That’s on top of a £10m bill for restructuring its European aerial business, which provides emergency medical and firefighting services. This will allow it to meet EU rules on ownership, and flying rights, once Britain has left the EU.In a statement to shareholders, the aerospace and defence company says:The UK exiting the EU has resulted in additional costs as we restructure our aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements.There is a one-off tax cost of around £10 million this year and we estimate that additional ongoing costs related to the operation of the new structures will be around £10 million per year.Babcock’s Emergency Medical Services provides air ambulance operators in Europe, and also Australia, and can provide its own doctors and nurses in a emergency. It also operates an Aerial Firefighting ision -- increasingly in demand, as climate change leads to more wildfires. Roland Rudd, who chairs the People’s Vote campaign, believes a second Brexit referendum is looking more likely.The new Independent Group are also backing the plan:But... some Labour MPs representing constituencies who voted Leave in June 2016 wouldn’t support another referendum, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh tweeted last night:The Financial Times also expects MPs to be offered the chance to delay Brexit, saying:If MPs reject a revised deal in a vote set to take place before March 12, Mrs May will then offer a vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or take a “short extension” of the Article 50 exit process.A Brexit delay now looks that “most likely path forward”, says Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada.He told City clients this morning:The PM will open the way for a “short” Brexit delay at a cabinet meeting this morning, according to reports, and outline the terms in her statement to the Commons this afternoon, ahead of tomorrow’s debate. The pound has jumped to its highest level in four weeks this morning, amid speculation that Britain’s departure from the European Union could be delayed.Sterling has rallied half a eurocent against the euro to €1.158, its highest level since 25th January. That’s nearly a 10-month high.The pound is also strengthening against the US dollar, up half a cent to $1.315, for the first time since the end of January.Last night, The Sun newspaper reported that Theresa May will today propose to Cabinet that she formally rules out a No Deal Brexit on March 29, opening the door to a delay.That could delay Brexit by weeks, or even months, if parliament fails to back her Withdrawal Agreement in the next few weeks.This would be a dizzying u-turn by the PM, who has long argued that Britain is leaving on the 29th March, come what may.But several cabinet ministers have been piling heavy pressure on May to categorically rule out a no-deal Brexit. Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark are all demanding that May rules out the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of next month.May insisted yesterday that a delay wouldn’t resolve anything, but the PM risks seeing the issue taken out of her hands. Tomorrow, MPs could pass a cross-party amendment laid by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin and Labour’s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario.News that the opposition Labour Party have also shifted their position, and could back a public vote on Brexit has also caught the City’s attention -- as it potentially increases the changes that Britain doesn’t leave at all.As my colleague Jessica Elgot reported last night:Jeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party’s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week.The decision to give the party’s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Two top central bankers will be in the spotlight today, facing questions about monetary policy and the state of the economy.Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due before the Treasury Committee at 10am GMT, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and external policymakers Gertjan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. They’ll be quizzed about the Bank’s latest Inflation Report, which slashed UK growth forecasts and warned a no-deal Brexit could cause a recession.MPs may also ask the Bank about the prospects of interest rate rises over the next couple of years, and the impact of the recent global slowdown on the UK.A few hours later, Carney’s US counterpart will also be facing lawmakers at the Senate. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s bi-annual testimony will be extremely closely watched by investors, for any clues on whether the Fed has ended its rate-hiking cycle.He’ll also be asked about plans to trim the Fed’s balance sheet, unwinding its massive stimulus programme, and the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war on the US economy.Markets have risen strongly since the Fed’s last meeting, at the end of January, when it was surprisingly dovish about monetary policy plans Powell’s comments today could easily move the dollar and US Treasury bond prices.The markets will also be chewing through new US housing data, and consumer confidence report.Plus, UK housebuilder Persimmon is updating the market - reporting that pre-tax profts have jumped to nearly £1.1bn - up from £970m last year. This is just days after it emerged Persimmon (under fire for paying bosses huge bonuses) could be banned from the government’s Help to Buy subsidy scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f69da012dfe6924635beb6d0ea69b799788c8ed/0_0_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d83bb52c76114bf0a0fb7066550a02f","title":"concrete the most destructive material on earth","story":"After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on the planet. But its benefits mask enormous dangers to the planet, to human health – and to culture itselfIn the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China’s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England.After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US.The material is the foundation of modern development, putting roofs over the heads of billions, fortifying our defences against natural disaster and providing a structure for healthcare, education, transport, energy and industry.Concrete is how we try to tame nature. Our slabs protect us from the elements. They keep the rain from our heads, the cold from our bones and the mud from our feet. But they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and – acting as a rock-hard second skin – desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses.Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.Can we kick our addiction, when it\u0027s so hard to imagine modern life without it? This week  Cities celebrates the aesthetic and social achievements of concrete, while investigating its innumerable harms, to learn what we can\u0026nbsp do to bring about a less grey world.\u0026nbspOur blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second. By one calculation, we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree, bush and shrub on the planet. Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one. Unlike the natural world, however, it does not actually grow. Instead, its chief quality is to harden and then degrade, extremely slowly.All the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes. The concrete industry pumps out more than that every two years. But though the problem is bigger than plastic, it is generally seen as less severe. Concrete is not derived from fossil fuels. It is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls. Doctors aren’t discovering traces of it in our blood. Nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs. We know where we are with concrete. Or to be more precise, we know where it is going: nowhere. Which is exactly why we have come to rely on it.This solidity, of course, is what humankind yearns for. Concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance. That is why it serves as the foundation of modern life, holding time, nature, the elements and entropy at bay. When combined with steel, it is the material that ensures our dams don’t burst, our tower blocks don’t fall, our roads don’t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected.Solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change. But – like any good thing in excess – it can create more problems than it solves. At times an unyielding ally, at times a false friend, concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact. Take the floods in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and Houston after Harvey, which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain, and storm drains proved woefully inadequate for the new extremes of a disrupted climate. This touches on the most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete, which is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification.Concrete can take our civilisation upwards, up to 163 storeys high in the case of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, creating living space out of the air. But it also pushes the human footprint outwards, sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats. The bioersity crisis – which many scientists believe to be as much of a threat as climate chaos – is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture, industrial estates and residential blocks.For hundreds of years, humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete. But the balance may now be tilting in the other direction.The Pantheon and Colosseum in Rome are testament to the durability of concrete, which is a composite of sand, aggregate (usually gravel or stones) and water mixed with a lime-based, kiln-baked binder. The modern industrialised form of the binder – Portland cement – was patented as a form of “artificial stone” in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin in Leeds. This was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete, the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building.Rivers of it were poured after the second world war, when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing. This was the period of brutalist architects such as Le Corbusier, followed by the futuristic, free-flowing curves of Oscar Niemeyer and the elegant lines of Tadao Ando – not to mention an ever-growing legion of dams, bridges, ports, city halls, university campuses, shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks. In 1950, cement production was equal to that of steel in the years since, it has increased 25-fold, more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner.Debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like Prince Charles, who condemned Owen Luder’s brutalist Tricorn Centre as a “mildewed lump of elephant droppings”, and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style, size and strength affordable for the masses.The politics of concrete are less isive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high. Hence the self-perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement-fests like the Olympics, the World Cup and international exhibitions.The classic example is Japan, which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country’s governance structure was often described as the doken kokka (construction state).At first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war. Then it provided the foundations for a new model of super-rapid economic development: new railway tracks for Shinkansen bullet trains, new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways, new runways for airports, new stadiums for the 1964 Olympics and the Osaka Expo, and new city halls, schools and sports facilities.This kept the economy racing along at near double-digit growth rates until the late 1980s, ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling Liberal Democratic party a stranglehold on power. The political heavyweights of the era – men such as Kakuei Tanaka, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita – were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns. Huge kickbacks were the norm. Yakuza gangsters, who served as go-betweens and enforcers, also got their cut. Bid-rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms (Shimizu, Taisei, Kajima, Takenaka, Obayashi, Kumagai) ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians. The doken kokka was a racket on a national scale.In his book Dogs and Demons, the author and longtime Japanese resident Alex Kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention. Runaway government-subsidised construction projects, he told an interviewer, “have wreaked untold damage on mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, everywhere — and it goes on at a heightened pace. That is the reality of modern Japan, and the numbers are staggering.”Traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified – and ignored. The cementation of Japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of mujo (impermanence), but was understandable given the ever-present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world’s most seismically active nations. Everyone knew the grey banked rivers and shorelines were ugly, but nobody cared as long as they could keep their homes from being flooded.Which made the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami all the more shocking. At coastal towns such as Ishinomaki, Kamaishi and Kitakami, huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes. Almost 16,000 people died, a million buildings were destroyed or damaged, town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars. It was a still more alarming story at Fukushima, where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown.Construction firms were once again ordered to hold back the sea, this time with even taller, thicker barriers. Their value is contested. Engineers claim these 12-metre-high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis, but locals have heard such promises before. The area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms. Environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer. Tellingly, even many tsunami-scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean.“It feels like we’re in jail, even though we haven’t done anything bad,” an oyster fisherman, Atsushi Fujita, told Reuters. “We can no longer see the sea,” said the Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures. He described them as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. “Our richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean,” he said. “Japan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.”There was an inevitability about this. Across the world, concrete has become synonymous with development. In theory, the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators, such as life-expectancy, infant mortality and education levels. But to political leaders, by far the most important metric is gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity that, more often than not, is treated as a calculation of economic size. GDP is how governments assess their weight in the world. And nothing bulks up a country like concrete.That is true of all countries at some stage. During their early stages of development, heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle. But for already mature economies, it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect. During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Keynesian economic advisers told the Japanese government the best way to stimulate GDP growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it. Preferably with cement. The bigger the hole, the better. This meant profits and jobs. Of course, it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people’s lives, but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement. This was the thinking behind Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s, which is celebrated in the US as a recession-busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete-pouring exercise up until that point. The Hoover Dam alone required 3.3m cubic metres, then a world record. Construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation. But that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in China, the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics). Beijing’s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower-in-waiting has required mountains of cement, beaches of sand and lakes of water. The speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing statistic of the modern age: since 2003, China has poured more cement every three years than the US managed in the entire 20th century.Today, China uses almost half the world’s concrete. The property sector – roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other cement-and-steel projects – accounted for a third of its economy’s expansion in 2017. Every major city has a floor-sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega-malls, housing complexes and concrete towers.But, like the US, Japan, South Korea and every other country that “developed” before it, China is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good. Ghost malls, half-empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending. Take the huge new airport in Luliang, which opened with barely five flights a day, or the Olympic Bird’s Nest stadium, so underused that it is now more a monument than a venue. Although the adage “build and the people will come” has often proved correct in the past, the Chinese government is worried. After the National Bureau of Statistics found 450 sq km of unsold residential floor space, the country’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the “annihilation” of excess developments.Empty, crumbling structures are not just an eyesore, but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land. Ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories, discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide. As the Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian has pointed out, it also suffocates the ecosystems – fertile soil, self-cleansing streams, storm-resisting mangrove swamps, flood-preventing forests – on which human beings ultimately depend. It is a threat to what he calls “eco-security”.Yu has led the charge against concrete, ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation. In his influential book The Art of Survival, he warns that China has moved dangerously far from Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. “The urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death,” he has said.Yu has been consulted by government officials, who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current Chinese model of growth. But their scope for movement is limited. The initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics. The president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high-tech production in order to create a “beautiful country” and an “ecological civilisation”, and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history, but Xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away, because it employs more than 55 million workers – almost the entire population of the UK. Instead, China is doing what countless other nations have done, exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas.Beijing’s much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative – an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the Marshall Plan – promises a splurge of roads in Kazakhstan, at least 15 dams in Africa, railways in Brazil and ports in Pakistan, Greece and Sri Lanka. To supply these and other projects, China National Building Material – the country’s biggest cement producer – has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations. This will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. As well as being the primary vehicle for super-charged national building, the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes. In many countries, the correlation is so strong, people see it as an index: the more concrete, the more corruption.As elsewhere, the craze for concrete in South America’s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development, then morphed into an economic necessity, and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and inidual greed. The progress between these stages was impressively rapid. The first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital, Brasília, on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior. A million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes.This was followed by a new highway through the Amazon rainforest – the TransAmazonia – and then from 1970, South America’s biggest hydroelectric power plant, the Itaipu on the Paraná river border with Paraguay, which is almost four times bulkier than the Hoover Dam. The Brazilian operators boast the 12.3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 Maracaña stadiums. This was a world record until China’s Three Gorges Dam choked the Yangtze with 27.2m cubic metres.With the military in power, the press censored and no independent judiciary, there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors. But the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post-dictatorship era, with virtually no party or politician left untainted.For many years, the most notorious of them was Paulo Maluf, the governor of São Paulo, who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as Minhocão, which means Big Worm. As well as taking credit for this project, which opened in 1969, he also allegedly skimmed $1bn from public works in just four years, part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the British Virgin islands. Although wanted by Interpol, Maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices. This was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him: “He steals, but he gets things done” – which could describe much of the global concrete industry.But his reputation as the most corrupt man in Brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a vast network of bid-rigging and money laundering. Giant construction firms – notably Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Corrêa – were at the heart of this sprawling scheme, which saw politicians, bureaucrats and middle-men receive at least $2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries, the Belo Monte dam, the 2014 World Cup, the 2016 Olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region. Prosecutors said Odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties.As a result of these revelations, one government fell, a former president of Brazil and the vice president of Ecuador are in prison, the president of Peru was forced to resign, and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars. The corruption scandal also reached Europe and Africa. The US Department of Justice called it “the largest foreign bribery case in history”. It was so huge that when Maluf was finally arrested in 2017, nobody batted an eyelid.Such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue, it is a motivation for environmental crime: billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through – as in the case of Belo Monte – against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities.Chatham House predicts urbanisation, population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year. If developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels, the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.The dangers are recognised. A report last year by Chatham House calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced. To reduce emissions, it urges greater use of renewables in production, improved energy efficiency, more substitutes for clinker and, most important, the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology – though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale.Architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and, when possible, to use other materials, such as cross-laminated timber. It is time to move out of the “concrete age” and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks, said Anthony Thistleton.“Concrete is beautiful and versatile but, unfortunately, it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation,” he told the Architects Journal. “We have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact.”But many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative. Steel, asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete. The world’s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber.Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, said the world was unlikely to reach a “peak concrete” moment.“The raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation,” he said. “By almost any measure it’s the least energy-hungry of all materials.”Instead, he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved, and, when that is not possible, to enhance recycling. Currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate. This could be done more efficiently, Purnell said, if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand. His colleagues at Leeds University are also exploring alternatives to Portland cement. Different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two-thirds, they say.Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.

The deputy prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweets that she hopes Scotland will follow suit in the referendum she secured at the last election for taking the Scottish National party into coalition with Labour. Gerry Adams gives the dedication as a statue of Jacob Rees-Mogg is unveiled in Crossmaglen. The Tory leader, Amber Rudd, refuses to publicly blame her predecessor Boris Johnson for the breakup of the union but, like the rest of what’s left of the country, she knows the truth.As anyone involved in the Good Friday agreement will tell you, principles guarantee no deal. It’s why the current Brexit negotiations between the UK and itself are going so well. Theresa May has red lines, the European Research Group (ERG) has absolute red lines, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has blood-red lines, and Jeremy Corbyn has blurred lines featuring Pharrell. If they all hold firm, we’re heading for a hard Brexit. And a united Ireland.We were always going to end up here because Brexit has never been about Nissan X-Trails or the shape of your bananas. It’s only ever been about sovereignty. For the gammons and bowler hats on the team, the final destination has always been the top of the white cliffs of Dover dressed as Dad’s Army, straddling Dysons.Northern Ireland has always been about sovereignty for a different reason – almost half of its population see themselves as Irish. How very rude. Yet as Brexiteers preach about their precious union, Irish nationalists in the same country are meant to park the union they want and just work out how the chicken crosses the border.Last week I was back in my home village of Dundrum, County Down. It lies in a constituency that in the past has elected both Éamon de Valera and Enoch Powell, but when talk in the pub turned to Brexit, the same truths were repeated again and again: nothing good can come of this for Northern Ireland. And: we knew this would happen.Most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU because there have only ever been two options post-Brexit – customs checks at the Irish border or in the Irish Sea. Each would cause isions just as we were bridging the gaps (in spite of our politicians). Depressingly, there’s no way through this.As the prime minister Maybots her way through the charade of alternative arrangements, there’s only one thing you need to know – there are no workable alternative arrangements. If there were, you’d have heard of them by now. The details of this technological masterpiece would already be a double-page spread in the Daily Mail with Rees-Mogg mocked up as Alan Turing under the headline “Enigma cracks Enigma – spirit of Bletchley takes back control”. If an alternative arrangement that worked actually existed (or was likely to exist in the next couple of years) Brexiteers would have already accepted the backstop, knowing they could easily replace it with their idea during the transition. The fact that they won’t bet on themselves tells you all you need to know about what they have in the locker.Yet none of that matters when you’ve inoculated yourself against reality. It’s why the ERG continues to cup its balls and cough while looking at a picture of Winston Churchill. “Did you feel that, too? We need a clean break.” Meanwhile, Corbyn complains the clock is being run down, but knows his last hope of a general election is when time’s up. To those outside the Labour party he’s become the José Mourinho of Brexit, sticking to a system that has lost half the dressing room while a people’s vote remains benched like Paul Pogba for daring to be more popular than the manager.All of this could have been avoided if the majority in Northern Ireland had been listened to during the referendum campaign. But as Nigel Farage and Johnson trumpeted their migrant-free magic kingdom, we were Kevin in Home Alone – only remembered at the baggage carousel after the plane had landed. It’s why the minutes of the first meeting between Michel Barnier and David Davis will never be released. “So, what do you propose for your land border with Europe?” Polite laughter. “We have a land border with you guys?”The housing minister Kit Malthouse brokered talks between Brexiters and former remainers on a possible way out of the Brexit impasse.The resulting \u0027Malthouse compromise\u0027 involves redrafting the backstop arrangement for the Irish border which is so unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptic MPs and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up the government.It would also extend the transition period, set out under the previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, until the end of 2021. The extension is designed to give extra time to agree a new trading relationship.Under the plan, the backstop would be replaced with a free trade agreement with as yet unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border.If the attempt to renegotiate the backstop fails, the Malthouse compromise proposes what amounts to a managed no deal.The PM would ask the EU to honour the extended transition period, in return for agreeing the £39bn orce bill and its commitments on EU citizens’ rights. This would give both sides time to prepare for departure on WTO terms at the end of 2021 – or to negotiate a different deal.The compromise is backed by the DUP, the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, and former remainers including Nicky Morgan. It is this unlikely coalition that helped secure Commons backing for the Brady amendment, which pledged to replace the backstop with unspecified \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027.Before MPs voted for that amendment and against others, Theresa May praised the Malthouse compromise. She said these were \u0027serious proposals\u0027 and she would engage with them \u0027seriously and positively\u0027.When Conservatives say they care about Northern Ireland, they actually just mean the freehold. Like a stable block with planning permission, they know the extra square footage adds value but they’ve no intention of actually developing it. Just as long as they can see it from the big house, they’re happy. As for those who live in the stable? If Brexit has proved anything, it’s that many Tories don’t give a stuff about the people of Northern Ireland – not even the unionists. If they did, they wouldn’t dream of a hard Brexit because it only guarantees one thing – a border poll.That’s one that will be decided not by Sinn Féin or DUP votes, but by the moderates in the middle – nationalists who once felt Irishenough post-Good Friday agreement and those pro-European unionists applying for Irish passports. The inevitable economic downturn and border circus of a hard Brexit might just be enough to swing those floating voters and Northern Ireland out of the union. So, why would any member of the Conservative and Unionist party take that risk? Because no matter what they say in public, they’ve never honestly believed Belfast is just like Finchley.All notions of a border poll could easily have been damped if, post-Brexit referendum, the DUP had accepted that Northern Ireland was a special case. Like they insisted it was when they asked George Osborne to drop Northern Ireland’s corporation tax to mirror the Republic back in 2014. Or how same-sex marriage and abortion laws are different to the rest of the UK thanks to a veto by the DUP in the Northern Ireland assembly (apparently, it’s also in a confidence and supply arrangement with the Lord Jesus). But that was never on the cards because, for the DUP, Brexit is about proving they’re biologically British, not adopted. It means the party will always order what Johnson and Farage are having but, unlike them, actually eat it.Of course, special status for Northern Ireland would mean some form of “dreaded backstop” (pause, pearl clutch, continue), but when a country has more than 300 land border crossings and only five main ports to the mainland, where would you rather try to do the “dreaded paperwork”? And, let’s face it, any customs check that can take place in the middle of the Irish Sea while a lorry driver hoovers a fry-up on the ferry then has a snooze in his bunk has to be a good thing. Cue sash-shaking Brexiteer rage. “Don’t you understand Northern Ireland would then become a rule-taker not a rule-maker?!” Because apparently, it’s all about rule-making – as the Stormont assembly, where rules should actually be made for Northern Ireland, remains in mothballs since 2016 because the DUP backed out of a deal with Sinn Féin to restore power sharing. So we’ve reached the fatberg in the sewer of principle. We’re told that the DUP has the government over a pork barrel and unless the backstop goes, it will bring the house down. But as time runs out, it’s actually the Tories who have the political wing of the Old Testament surrounded.On the one side is May’s deal (complete with backstop). On the other is the ERG and a hard Brexit. If the DUP buckles on the backstop, party members will walk away with their UK sovereignty between their legs. For those of us who have their early albums, this isn’t going to happen.Which leaves just one option. The DUP holds firm and jumps off the cliff with the ERG, knowing a hard Brexit is the only scenario that guarantees a hard border in Ireland, a border poll in Northern Ireland and the perfect economic storm where it could lose that vote. By trying to be the most British person in the room, the DUP could actually end up the most Irish.Whisper it quietly, but the best outcome for the DUP is actually a people’s vote. They’ll scream red, white and blue murder if it happens but privately breathe a sigh of relief. Like Boris Johnson, they never wanted Brexit but wanted to be seen to support it. A second referendum offers an escape from their worst nightmare, while allowing them to reluctantly go along with “the will of the entire country”. Very unionist.For Northern Ireland as a whole, another EU referendum is also the only way out of this mess. Not to save face. But to save peace, prosperity and a shared future. It’s wrong that Northern Ireland should take one for the team so that others can have their version of Brexit. It’s now time to act, or Northern Ireland might decide the team is no longer worth playing for.• Patrick Kielty is a Northern Ireland-born comedian and TV presenter.

I had only just joined the Liberal party.Within months, there were nearly 20 liaison committees between the SDP and the Liberal party in Oxfordshire, where I was living. I spent my 20s sitting on them and delivering leaflets – rather than drinking and partying as I had meant to.The delivering at least got me exercising the committees were a staggering waste of time. So it is worth remembering now that the merged party that resulted is suddenly in a similar position as they contend with the new Independent Group in parliament.It’s a difficult paradox for the Lib Dems. On the one hand, this is a tribute to the kind of politics they espouse on the other, it could so easily cramp their style and crowd them out. They have to embrace it somehow, without ending up in the bureaucratic nightmare that swallowed my 20s.So this is what I believe Vince Cable should do. As soon as possible, the Lib Dems should join the Independent Group in parliament. I suggest this partly for the good of the independents. Joining the 11 Lib Dems (plus Stephen Lloyd, who resigned the whip recently, but who would surely then follow suit) would double their size and give them momentum. The new group would then be almost two-thirds of the way to becoming the third largest party (currently the SNP with 35 seats), and closer to the public funding attached for policymaking.I am not suggesting that there should cease to be a Lib Dem group. I see no reason why they should not be a party in their own right, as the Co-operative party manages to be within Labour.If Brexit has ided the big parties, it has also separated the Lib Dems from their Brexit-voting supporters in the west country and Celtic fringes. It has hollowed out their message so thoroughly that only the cognoscenti can discern one.Part of the problem in the 1980s was that those iniduals who chose to join the SDP tended to be those most suspicious of the grassroots – and who clung most closely to parliamentary pomp. They were therefore least able to discern a new kind of politics in practice. Nobody is saying the current group is like that, so far. But they may turn out to be Westminster people and, like the old SDP, not easy to portray as insurgents.It may also become more difficult to join the independents as they become more formal. Nobody would expect any kind of formal agreement now not to stand in each other’s constituencies at the general election, but it won’t be long before they will insist. It may not be within Cable’s power to provide this, but it needs to be faced urgently whether he joins the independents or not.What the Lib Dems would bring to the new group is depth, because they have history – 160 years of it, in fact. And this might be a useful addition to a new group that has no depth at all.I must admit my heart sank when the Independent Group’s Anna Soubry put “sound finance” top of her policy wishlist last week. It depends what she meant, of course. If she meant it has to work for everyone, then fair enough. But the word “sound” tends to mean “conventional”, which is about the last thing we want. A new kind of politics that fails to provide us with a new kind of economics – effective for the people and the planet, and tackling the threat to our prosperity from emerging monopolies – is really not worth the effort.Very quietly, the Lib Dems have been thinking about these issues, and they can help the combined group – if they can all raise their heads from Brexit for a short period.As a veteran of 1981, I dare not mention “breaking the mould” – but the gang of 11 is right now the best hope for breaking the stranglehold of right and left conservatism in Westminster. That’s why the Lib Dems must join now, not later.• David Boyle is policy director of the radical centre thinktank Radix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3494d592180e0242d7609325d4b35055e495bd8c/0_245_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848e0b06c63004a8766bb3b3fe90f38e","title":"jihadi bride shamima begum female militants","story":"Tabloid sensationalism about Shamima Begum flattens important debates about how much agency these women haveThere are around 150 British women in the world who can be called “jihadi brides” – those who left places such as Luton, Birmingham and Burton upon Trent to migrate to the Islamic State and eventually marry its fighters – and Shamima Begum is one of the youngest. She assumed this status as a minor, and the use of the term “jihadi bride” by journalists and commentators to describe her is appalling, a heaping of further trauma on a groomed child.Tabloid sensationalism flattens a complicated and necessary debate about agency: whether these women had any and how much and the extent to which they should be held accountable for the spectacular violence Isis has inflicted, even if they were not directly involved and some of them were crushed by it, too. In trying to get to the bottom of these questions for a forthcoming book, I interviewed more than 20 Isis women.At the heart of this problem is female militancy itself: the historical and near-universal aversion across so many societies to viewing young women as capable of dreadful violence, and the incentives for powerful governments and militaries to downplay or amplify the nature of female militancy and its implications. One premise underlying the term “jihadi bride” is that the debutante in question holds no valid political grievances, is indoctrinated into accepting grotesque violence as legitimate, and as “just” a wife plays a dangerous but marginal role in the working of the armed group to which she is wed rather than operationally affiliated. “In-house whores for Isis,” as one columnist memorably called them in 2015. The term also tilts toward characterising such women as civilian spouses of jihadist militants, akin to the German wives who held dinner parties for Nazi SS officers, rather than aspirant members who joined first and wed second, or at least concurrently.There is a gentle infantilisation to almost any description of militancy that includes the word “bride”, so resonant and feminine. Its inclusion is almost antique, from a time when women had hysterics and doctors acting on behalf of the patriarchy had to pacify them with dubious sex therapies or lobotomies. But perhaps in the past this patronising view also served a social function: if militants’ wives were just wives, society could forgive them more easily and, once the fighting was over, they could serve as bridges back to some normalcy. Women could then try to explain what had overtaken their sons and husbands (as Osama bin Laden’s mother has done). As I wrote earlier this year, in Nigeria viewing women who voluntarily joined the Boko Haram insurgency as wives who didn’t commit violence has helped communities grudgingly tolerate their reintegration. Returnee men are often simply slaughtered.But this inherited thinking has outlived its use, especially in light of the way militant groups themselves play on gender to recruit and swell their ranks. Ignoring women’s agency in this process obscures our understanding of all the ways, meaningful, oblique and direct, that women lent their power and numbers to Isis. Women in the caliphate served as doctors and midwives, language instructors, recruiters and intelligence agents, and morality policewomen who tormented locals.With the flow of Isis men and women out of the group’s last patch of territory and the prospect of them returning to their countries of origin, there are loud voices now calling for the suspension of “jihadi bride”. But sometimes these reflect social and political forces with their own agendas, such as Sajid Javid’s early bid for the Tory leadership, which was signalled through the stripping of Begum’s status as a British citizen. In the rush to bestow militant women agency, there is a tendency to blaze past any legal and investigative process and hold girls such as Begum just as accountable as those who beheaded civilians. The haste to make her indoctrinated, feeble responses to journalists’ questions appear lucid and defining of her fate is reminiscent of the excesses of the post-911 period, when jihadists disappeared into the facility at Guantánamo Bay in a netherworld of lawless, indefinite detainment. Among those who directly suffered under Isis there is an understandable impatience with the attention such women receive, but among some voices from Syria and Iraq, the language about Begum is sometimes dehumanising, making her the focus for both justified rage at what transpired and a target for sectarian or ethnic hate.Our need for new, measured and more forensic language to characterise female militancy and the agency that underpins it is now clear. Yet we must remain sensitive to the coercion and violence many female Isis members experienced themselvesIt is worth remembering that, after a certain point, it became virtually impossible to leave the caliphate. During the years I spent following the stories of female Isis members, I was in touch with women, or families of women, who were repulsed by what they saw unfolding and tried to escape. Kadiza Sultana, one of the three original Bethnal Green girls, saw she had made a terrible mistake and worked with her family in London to plan her evacuation. She died in an airstrike on the building where she lived, before the collapse of the territorial caliphate gave her a chance to flee.It is no disrespect to the victims of Isis to hear women such as Begum attempt to explain their motivations. Perhaps not immediately after having a baby, in a fetid IDP camp, but later, in a courtroom – or, better, in a transitional justice hearing, where she could be confronted with the stories of Yazidi women such as Nobel peace prize winner Nadia Murad, the victims of Isis who were faceless at the time, about whose suffering Begum was, and remains, chillingly incurious.There are legal bases on which to assess criminal accountability, which require investigations and collection of evidence. But we are also struggling to understand, as a society encumbered by loaded terms such as “jihadi bride”, how much blame to accord such women. This requires learning precisely what they did – and what might have been done to them.The role of women in Isis is one of the most significant questions of the post-Arab spring period, the aftermath of a historic sweeping revolt that women often led and animated. The Syrian Isis woman who met Begum at the Syrian border that dark night in February 2015 and escorted her into Raqqa told me later how surprised she was by the Bethnal Green girls’ submissiveness. The driver snapped at them to cover their hair properly, and they smilingly complied.This woman, a bookish university student, a Hemingway reader who had gone from demonstrating against Bashar al-Assad to working for Isis at the behest of her family, couldn’t understand what had brought these London girls to the hell that had become her country. They seemed bewitched. She herself was dissimulating each day, biding her time until she could just get out.• Azadeh Moaveni is a former Middle East correspondent for Time magazine and author of a forthcoming book on Isis women called The House for Young Widows"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01ae6e1d2ba1b7ae8d1a6325057fcff27c93e20/0_108_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af616d417455472737d666064f86ecde","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

But not all agreeThousands of pupils walked out of their classrooms on the Friday before half-term to protest against the lack of action on climate change. Though many headteachers privately support the strike, the issue has ided the school community. In a letter to the , more than 200 academics backed the students’ stand, but the two headteacher unions said it was disruptive for schools and raised safeguarding issues. So should pupils have time off to protest?professor of education, Cambridge University“Yes, definitely. I’d like to think that had I still been teaching in a school, I would have taken a stand and gone on strike in support. The older generation has really let young people down with short-termism and by prioritising self-interest, and I think young people in the UK lack opportunities for democratic engagement.“Most of those involved in the strike are too young to have a vote. Protesting is one of the very few ways in which they can take political action and be part of a participatory democracy. I encouraged my niece to go and she came back full of enthusiasm, and also much better informed about the state of the environment. Some people have argued that children are missing out on learning. Well, I think it’s a positive learning experience to come together collectively in a common cause.” executive headteacher, Harrogate grammar school, and president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL)“No. I don’t agree with pupils taking strike action as a protest against climate change. The cause is vital to humanity and I feel personal shame that my generation has allowed this crisis to happen on our watch. But a pupil strike is not the right approach. Each day’s learning is important for their life chances and their potential to go out and change the world. Schools are also in loco parentis and it is a concern if pupils are off site.“We had a small number of very able and principled students let us know they planned to take strike action. Colleagues met them and explained why this was difficult for the school to support as we would struggle with our duty to keep them safe. The head and deputy voiced their support for the cause and showed them what the school was doing to respond to the challenge of climate change. We are not aware of any students who were absent because of strike action.”​A-level student, Brighton, Hove and Sussex sixth-form college“Yes, we should be allowed time off. I think if you care passionately about something enough that it makes you want to go on strike, you should be able to.“I say that as someone who values my education, especially right now, with my A-level exams coming up. Missing a day of sixth form meant a lot to me – it was very costly for me to go when I am right in the middle of revising for my mocks – but I think it was important the strike took place during the school term. If it had not, it would not have been so impactful or controversial.“I have heard people arguing that young people went on strike to get out of school. Those people are not taking us seriously, they are not taking the issue of climate change seriously, and that attitude is part of the reason why we went on strike. When I read the statistics about global warming and what is going to happen in the future, I don’t think enough is being done by older people. If I can do something to make a difference, even if it’s just making everyone around me aware that I’m concerned, then I’m going to jump at that. If older people don’t want us to strike, they need to act.“My parents signed me out of college along with my younger brother, who is in secondary school, so they took responsibility for ‘safeguarding’ us that day. I know other young people whose parents didn’t want them going, and schools that didn’t allow it. And those young people felt silenced.” “I’d like to say yes, but I’m struggling. A school cannot authorise absence for this purpose. A parent can withdraw their child, but must be willing to accept the consequence of a fine. Headteachers rightly have safeguarding concerns for those who miss school yet whose whereabouts are unknown in uncoordinated events such as Friday’s marches. “However, I believe peaceful, powerful protest has a valuable place in a civilised, democratic society much good has historically come from it. Teenagers must be able to form, express and share their views. Adults need to listen to young people. They are voters of the future and dismissing or patronising their actions and views now may be something politicians later regret.”“Yes. The school community felt very strongly about the strike and I was happy to authorise the absences of those who wanted to take part. I sense a great deal of exasperation from children that political leaders of the world today seem to be unable or unwilling to take decisive and unilateral action on climate change. Instant gratification and myopic political point-scoring blindly trumps all.“As the head of a Quaker school that takes its responsibility towards the environment seriously, I believe it is incumbent upon us to support the children of today in making their voices heard. What is education about? If we do not have a planet to live on, then there is not a lot of point in learning about Pythagoras or Shakespeare. “Whatever the debate about climate change, there is clear and troubling scientific evidence, which cannot be ignored. Many children rightly have a sense of urgency and they absolutely should have a voice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c542a99dcc7a00cbe9e4fe68231406a9197ae509/0_140_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e3a5351d231d0462af55712c71f867a","title":"san francisco coyote lady urban wildlife on rise","story":"With the animal making a comeback in many US cities, enthusiasts such as San Francisco’s ‘coyote lady’ have become both educator and defenderSan Francisco’s resident Coyote Lady met her first coyote early one cool June morning on Twin Peaks, one of the city’s tallest hills.The coyote was a curious little thing, prancing here and there, dashing up the hill, and then down, all the while watching this strange creature and her dog. “She ran this way, she ran that way, she was so excited, like, ‘What’s going on? What are you doing?’” said Janet Kessler, 69.In other words, it was as if Kessler met herself that day in 2007. Describing her first magical encounter, Kessler jumped up from her table at a local cafe to show how that coyote danced and played. Skittering back and forth, she demonstrated that the coyote was more than just an animal, more than the predator feared by small-dog owners, more than just the vermin that so many in rural areas still consider these creatures to be.“She had a personality,” Kessler said. “She was interested. She was intelligent. She obviously had emotions. She was reaching beyond her species.”From that first meeting, Kessler was hooked, becoming part of a growing fascination over coyotes that has swept the United States over the past decade. This fascination – and the subsequent research borne from it – has centered in particular on coyotes that inhabit cities, as more and more coyotes appear to be making their homes in urban hubs across North America.Coyotes once considered many of these cities their native habitats, but were driven out throughout the 20th century. Within the last two decades, however, they quietly began making their way back. They’re trotting through the parks. They’re crossing streets. They’re hopping on the roof of bars.While there’s no official count (though some organizations have estimates for specific cities) coyotes have been spotted living in Chicago, Denver, Washington DC, and New York in addition to San Francisco, as well as in Madison, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon.And as coyotes become more visible, coyote enthusiasts nationwide have found themselves stepping into the role of both coyote defender and educator, fighting the very human instinct to shun what is unfamiliar and encouraging instead the concept of coexistence.“Seeing something that seems so wild, a really standard response is to say they have no place in an urban setting,” said Jaymi Heimbuch, director of the Urban Coyote Initiative. “But coyotes used to be here before San Francisco was ever built. Now they’re back, and they’re not going away. How do we deal with it? How do we minimize conflict?”In general, conflict is already minimal. Coyotes tend to keep to themselves and shy away from humans. They are known to sometimes exhibit defensive behavior around dogs – and sometimes prey on small unattended pets – but the average coyote is only 45lbs, said Mark Weckel, one of the co-founders of the Gotham Coyote Project in New York.“There’s always concern, but for the most part, coyotes don’t pose a threat to humans,” Weckel said. “Coyotes do so well in urban areas because they do so well in avoiding us.”The last reported negative coyote-human interaction in New York occurred in 1995, Weckel noted, before anyone realized that coyotes were making their way back into urban spaces. The best course of action should anyone come across a coyote in an urban setting is to just walk away.This push in coyote research comes almost out of necessity. Yes, researchers say, coyotes are apex predators that sometimes have a taste for small dogs – but they also mate for life. They form social relationships. They play and explore and make their homes in places no one expects them to be.Anthropomorphizing – projecting human traits to animals – is typically frowned upon in the scientific world. But when humans and animals live in such close proximity to one another, it’s hard not to make that connection.“One of the reasons why I love coyotes is that they are so much like us,” Heimbuch said. “We are just like, ‘Oh, this place looks good. Well, this is home now. Look no further.’ I think that’s awesome.”But at a certain point, there’s anthropomorphizing and then there’s just observation. In the 12 years that San Francisco’s Coyote Lady, Janet Kessler, has spent photographing, tracking, and writing about the city’s coyotes on her website, she has observed enough to know that coyotes live full lives, sometimes without anyone noticing.“It takes time,” Kessler said. “You can’t just go to a park and pick it up. Spend years in that park and you’ll find out who’s Dad, who’s Mom, the pups that are last year’s, the pups that are this year’s, who likes each other, who gets along, who is sort of shy and withdrawn and who doesn’t mind being seen. It all comes out.”Almost every day Kessler goes to a city park where the coyotes are known to frequent, usually once early in the morning and once just before dusk, with her waist-length hair pulled back low and her heavy gear strapped around her waist. On one recent afternoon, Kessler made her way onto a narrow path on a hill in a San Francisco park, navigating her lean frame over the uneven ground with ease. She let out a breath at the telltale sight of a dark brown pile. “Coyote scat,” she said with a smile. “We found their trail.”When asked how she knew it was coyote scat and not dog poop, she went into detail about the musty smell, the ropey look of the feces, the seeds, the fur. “You just know after a while,” she said.This was how Kessler knew the puffs of fur in another part of the park belonged to a dog, not a coyote. It was how she knew the little paw prints in the mud were not made by coyotes (“Coyotes have more elongated paws,” she explained, “and their two middle fingers point inward”).It was how, out of the farthest possible corner of her eye, nearly 400ft away, she spotted a coyote that she referred to as Big Red.‘“There! There!” she said, scrambling down a hillside. “Coyote, first coyote sighting!”Kessler kept one whole other bramble-filled slope between her and the rust-tinged animal before she began to snap her photos, but even from that distance, she could recognize him as one half of the breeding pair that frequented that area. She recognized him in the same way she can recognize all the other coyotes she has documented – by their faces, by their gaits, by their personalities. “I study them as iniduals because that’s what they are,” Kessler said.“Every coyote is different,” she said. “Every coyote has its own personality. I tell you, it’s not so different from watching humans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e16890eac1e190dc400b803789810f8e3dddad9c/0_204_3798_2279/master/3798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474228170f2fa36df29de0a986b09571","title":"tell us what you are doing to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions","story":"We’d like to hear about the action you and yours have taken to reduce greenhouse gases It’s the crisis that we just can’t seem to tame: the ominous rise of global temperatures, aggravated by the burning of fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases.But not everyone is belching out emissions like there is no tomorrow.

Festival slots are being negotiated, release dates are being discussed, campaigns are being plotted and, so inevitably, staggeringly, perhaps stupidly, early predictions are being made.So take these 10 potential contenders with a pinch of salt unless of course they turn out to be entirely accurate then instead, look back on them, and the  at large, in stunned awe.It has been 18 years since Hanks received his last Oscar nomination, after a decade of almost non-stop adoration from the Academy and before a string of perceived snubs for his work in Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Next year sees him campaigning for a comeback as children’s television staple Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a drama that acts as a narrative sibling to last year’s surprise hit documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor? While the sugary combination of actor and character might already be giving you toothache, the film’s director Marielle Heller, who brought complex and often cruel characters to the screen in Diary of a Teenage Girl and Can You Ever Forgive Me?, suggests something far spikier.It speaks to Tarantino’s standing with the Academy that The Hateful Eight was seen as a blip, despite winning one Oscar and being nominated for two others. Before the snowy Agatha Christie-esque exercise in self-indulgence, he’d had a brief streak with Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained nabbing 13 nominations between them, and it’s a safe bet his next film will see him back in the main races once again. As well as a soft spot for Tarantino, the Academy has an even softer one for films about films and his 60s-set Once Upon a Time in Hollywood reads like Academy catnip. As well as the LA setting, there’s a stacked cast (including Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie and Al Pacino) and a storyline that brings in everyone from Steve McQueen to Sharon Tate.Ever since she was named best actress for Black Swan, Portman has taken the unconventional route of mostly avoiding obvious Oscar-bait roles. She’s cropped up in the Thor franchise, slummed it in comedies like No Strings Attached and Your Highness, stared into space for Terrence Malick in Knight of Cups and Song to Song and hunted indefinable aggressors in Annihilation. Her one nomination since, for playing Jackie Kennedy, was in a strange, complicated and provocative drama that defied stuffy biopic formula, and last year she was put forward for Vox Lux, a similarly curious and unusual film. Her next project sounds like a surer thing for awards attention, playing a woman whose affair with a fellow astronaut sends her on a downward spiral. Although with Fargo and Legion’s Noah Hawley in the director’s chair, expect the unexpected.After his powerful performance in Get Out snagged him a best actor nomination (and, in my mind, should have led to him taking home the Oscar), Daniel Kaluuya followed it with a banner year as one of the SAG-winning Black Panther ensemble and arguably the MVP of Steve McQueen’s Widows, his menacing turn deserving of even more awards attention. In 2020, he could have a strong chance with Queen \u0026amp Slim, the directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas, acclaimed director of many a music video as well as episodes of Insecure and Master of None. The prescient tale, written by Lena Waithe, sees a black couple’s first date go wrong when they shoot a cop in self-defence before going on the run.Gary Oldman’s post-Oscar career has provided him with hours even darker than the one that got him there with critically loathed sci-fi thriller Tau and bland Gerard Butler actioner Hunter Killer to his name. In-between some of the schlockier films he has on the horizon, including haunted boat horror Mary and crime thriller Killers Anonymous, Oldman will play lawyer Jürgen Mossack in Steven Soderbergh’s hotly anticipated Panama Papers drama The Laundromat. He’s one of many cast members who could see himself in the race with Meryl Streep, David Schwimmer, Jeffrey Wright, Matthias Schoenaerts all starring alongside.One of the few performances here that some critics, including myself, have already seen is Annette Bening’s rich, detailed take on senator Dianne Feinstein in The Report, a compelling, angry retelling of the investigation into post 911 torture practices. It’s commanding work that avoids mere mimicry and Bening exists on that surprising list of great actors who have never won an Oscar, despite four nominations, and given how the Academy has been turning bridesmaids into brides in recent years, from Leo to Glenn, a best supporting actress win could make sense. The film’s talky, unemotional directness might turn some voters off but, aside from Scott Z Burns’ info-packed script, she has the best chance of recognition.Making small but impactful impressions last year in both Widows and Bad Times at El Royale, the Tony-winning actor and singer Cynthia Erivo is about to enjoy a much bigger year. She’ll crop up in Doug Liman’s big-budget YA adaptation Chaos Walking, 12 Years a Slave writer John Ridley’s sci-fi adventure Needle in a Timestack and, most prominently, as abolitionist and activist Harriet Tubman in an awards-aiming biopic. Film-makers have tried to bring Tubman’s story to the screen before, with a Viola Davis-starring project once mooted, but final responsibility was given to Kasi Lemmons, who impressed with her 1997 debut Eve’s Bayou and next year, could become the first woman of colour to nab a nomination for best director.If you were one of the precious few who saw James Gray’s last film, the wonderful yet sorely underseen adventure The Lost City Of Z, you’ll also be aware of how sorely under-nominated it was as well. The director started out in smaller, grittier crime fare but his bleak period drama The Immigrant, also sorely underseen, kicked off a new, more ambitious phase in his career. He’s expanding his scope even further with Ad Astra, a pet project that’s set to be one of 2019’s most fascinating films, starring Brad Pitt as an engineer traveling through the solar system to find his lost father, played by Tommy Lee Jones. Gray has compared the story to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness while also claiming it will be “the most realistic depiction of space travel that’s been put in a movie”. Its May release date could also suggest a Cannes premiere.Oscar winner Charlize Theron found herself on the outskirts of the most recent best actress race with her lived in portrayal of a mother under pressure in Tully, but next time she might fare better in the best supporting actress category with her latest transformative role. In the Untitled Roger Ailes Project, working title Fair and Balanced, she’s taking on Megyn Kelly as she helped take on the misogynistic culture at Fox News. But just in case you might worry that Kelly will be branded as some sort of hero, given her heinous history of racism, reports suggest that The Big Short writer Charles Randolph has crafted her as “ambitious, hard-working and not highly intelligent”. The stacked cast, also including Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon and Allison Janney, suggests multiple nominations could be in store.One of the many great things about Donald Glover’s dazzling awards magnet Atlanta is the rise of Zazie Beetz, an actor whose charming yet underused presence makes one crave so much more. She has since cropped up in Deadpool 2, High Flying Bird and, ermmm, Geostorm and this year, she will be in pretty much everything. While roles in schlocky horror Wounds and the Joaquin Phoenix-starring Joker movie are unlikely to inspire Academy acclaim, Beetz will also appear in two juicy Oscar prospects. The first is Lucy in the Sky, the aforementioned drama that stars Natalie Portman as a troubled astronaut, and the second is Against All Enemies, where she will play activist Dorothy Jamal in a fact-based thriller also starring Kristen Stewart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

They would then be destroyed to make space.”Malcolm Hughes, then the club’s educational welfare officer, admits in a two-page statement that “some of Barry Bennell’s actions could have raised suspicions” and the chairman, John Bowler, acknowledges that Crewe did not fully appreciate the dangers of football being used as a means for a paedophile to prey on young boys.As an insight into how calculating and devious Bennell was, it transpires he was personally responsible for the appointment of Hughes – almost certainly a ploy by Bennell to make it look as though he and Crewe regarded the welfare of the children as a priority.Yet Hughes makes the candid admission that in his early years at Crewe he had only a limited understanding of safeguarding issues. “I certainly did not have the level of awareness that I currently have about the opportunities and potential for child sexual abuse and a need to monitor and check members of staff,” he writes.Bennell was branded “the devil incarnate” and “sheer evil” by a judge after being convicted last year of 50 specimen charges relating to 12 boys from the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City from 1979 to 1991. It was his fourth prison sentence in the past 25 years and, as the  revealed in September, the man who was described in court as an “industrial-scale child molester” is also facing the possibility of another criminal trial involving nine more complainants alleging child rape. As of January last year, at least 97 people – though the number is now thought to be beyond 100 – had reported Bennell on the back of the interview Andy Woodward, the former Crewe footballer, gave to the  in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club’s youth system.As well as Gradi, Bowler, Palin and Hughes, Crewe’s then assistant academy director, Terry McPhillips, now manager of Blackpool, and the then kit-man, John Fleet, state among hundreds of pages of evidence that they had never heard any rumour, innuendo or complaints relating to Bennell.As well as his usual salary, Bennell was paid an extra £5 a night per boy in expenses to accommodate them, with up to 12 youngsters sleeping at a house he had turned into a “children’s paradise”. Bennell would show them horror films and had arcade machines, a pool table, a juke box, a monkey, two Pyrenean dogs, an Alsatian named after Zico and even a puma he had bought from Poole zoo.“The simple fact that Bennell had boys staying with him was not out of ordinary for this club,” Gradi writes. “I had (and still have on occasions) boys staying with me and indeed all my coaches have boys staying with them from time to time. One has to appreciate the nature of this club. We do not have endless resources and our boys are often brought through the ranks and stay with the club out of personal loyalty.”As one example, Gradi referenced one youth-team player, who later played for Liverpool and England, who would stay at his own house at weekends and “stayed with Crewe for many years” despite other clubs trying to tempt him away. The player in question is understood to be Danny Murphy, who joined Crewe on schoolboy terms and eventually moved to Liverpool, aged 20, for £1.5m. Crewe no longer operate this practice, in line with modern safeguarding rules.Palin would not let her own son train with Bennell, according to evidence from one witness to the FA’s ongoing inquiry, and makes it clear in a statement from November 2003 that she was uncomfortable in his presence. “I have to say that at the time I did not like him. I cannot put my finger upon what it was that caused me to dislike him. He was just one of those people who, on occasions, one takes an instantaneous dislike to.”Gradi, however, was such an admirer of Bennell he supplied a character reference on behalf of his former colleague when the man he appointed in 1985 was arrested during a tour with the Stone Dominoes youth team to Florida nine years later. Gradi’s initial information was that the rape allegation was “sour grapes” from a disgruntled player.“The first time I believed the allegations was when I went to the local Spa and bumped into the mother of another boy who had been with us. His friend, who had come to us from Manchester City, had apparently told his parents about Bennell, but no complaint had ever been made to either me or this club.” He adds: “Until this case came along I was fairly confident that I knew everything that was going on around the club.”The only complaint about Bennell, according to Gradi, related to the coach’s “authoritarian streak” and one occasion when the youth team were made to “walk home from the countryside after a poor game”. Bowler refers to the same incident, believed to relate to a match at Manchester United when Bennell dropped off a minibus of teenagers at Beeston Castle, 15 miles from Crewe, pointed them in the wrong direction and told them to find their own way back. Several hitch-hiked.“I seem to recall there had been a complaint from a father of one of these boys,” Bowler writes. “I spoke to Dario Gradi about it and Barry Bennell was, to the best of my recollection, reprimanded.”“I do not believe there was the same amount of awareness of the dangers posed by sexual predators such as Barry Bennell. It is fair to say that we, as a club (like the rest of society), did not appreciate many of those dangers at that time, although the general care and safety of the young boys was very important to the club.”As for Bennell’s departure from the club, Gradi’s explanation that it was purely a football matter is followed by other passages appraising him as one of the best talent-spotters in the business. Bennell, he says, was “almost Brazilian” in terms of having “all the skills of tricks and flicks that would get the kids excited”. He had a talent for recruiting youngsters who seemed devoted and loyal to a man with a “lot of charm and a great hold over the boys he had recruited”. Gradi even admits being worried by the possibility that if Bennell ever joined another club the players at Crewe would follow him.“I accept I was responsible for appointing Barry Bennell to the club,” Gradi, who makes no reference to having coached Bennell in Chelsea’s youth system during the early-1970s, writes. “I made no detailed inquiries as to his background before taking him on. From the inquiries that I did make, I gleaned that Barry Bennell was a well-respected coach in the Manchester area and that was good enough for me. He did not have any specific coaching qualifications but none were required and at the time the FA did not publish any guidance on child protection.”Gradi’s ongoing suspension is from all football-related matters while the FA’s inquiry, led by Clive Sheldon QC, investigates what happened at Crewe as well as claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Eddie Heath, the chief scout who has been identified as a repeat offender."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1b665f10a559f1fc96961fe6732ec45e7580250/47_124_3168_1901/master/3168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99e45c2fca8338b1d01f81109bfd9951","title":"david luiz maurizio sarri lift chelsea tottenham","story":"Kepa Arrizabalaga has apologised to the Chelsea head coach, Maurizio Sarri, his teammates and the club’s supporters for refusing to be substituted late in the Carabao Cup final, with the world’s most expensive goalkeeper fined one week’s wages – around £190,000 – for his act of petulance.Chelsea have sought to draw a line under the incident after Arrizabalaga’s show of dissent at Wembley, put down to a misunderstanding in the immediate aftermath of the defeat by Manchester City on penalties, publicly undermined Sarri’s authority. The Italian has found himself under mounting pressure of late with open revolt erupting in the stands over his tactics during the recent FA Cup elimination by Manchester United, and Arrizabalaga’s actions had fuelled the suspicion that a mutinous mood was now spreading on to the pitch.The goalkeeper had twice required treatment during extra time, apparently suffering from cramp – he subsequently suggested he had been buying time for his teammates to recover after a gruelling goalless final – before angrily waving away frantic attempts by Sarri and his assistant, Gianfranco Zola, to replace him with Willy Caballero in the last minute of extra time.His refusal to leave the field prompted a furious reaction from Sarri who, after the final whistle, attempted to confront the 24-year-old and had to be held back by Antonio Rüdiger as the players gathered to compose themselves for the shootout.That was duly lost 4-3, with Arrizabalaga saving from Leroy Sané but allowing Sergio Agüero’s penalty to slip under his body and in.The pair spoke post-match, insisting the incident had stemmed from a breakdown in communication with the £71.3m world-record signing insisting it had “never been my intention to go against the manager”. He subsequently went further on social media: “I have full respect for the coach and his authority.”While no senior players had attempted to usher him off with the fourth official holding up his number and his prospective replacement waiting awkwardly on the touchline, his refusal to leave the pitch is understood to have left teammates distinctly unimpressed.Sarri and Arrizabalaga had attempted to clear the air in the dressing room after media duties had been completed, with the issue addressed again at a team meeting at Cobham before the squad’s warm-down session on Monday.Regardless, the head coach and player still felt compelled to release statements through the club late on Monday night to resolve the issue well in advance of Wednesday’s Premier League game at home against Tottenham.“I was very happy to play in my first cup final for Chelsea and very proud of the team performance,” said Arrizabalaga. “I have thought a lot more about yesterday’s events. Although there was a misunderstanding, on reflection, I made a big mistake with how I handled the situation.“I wanted to take the time today to apologise fully and in person to the coach, to Willy, my teammates and to the club. I have done this and now I want to offer the same apology to the fans. I will learn from this episode and will accept any punishment or discipline the club decides is appropriate.”That amounts to a fine of one week’s wages, which has been donated to the Chelsea Foundation, with the club dropping their customary policy of keeping any internal sanctions private.Sarri had initially criticised the player’s conduct while toeing the party line over the misunderstanding, but has now received a personal apology.“Kepa and I have spoken about the incident,” he said. “It was a good conversation. There was a misunderstanding yesterday but he realises he made a big mistake in the way he reacted. He has apologised to me, his team-mates and the club.“It is up to the club if they want to discipline him according to the club rules, but for me this matter is now closed.“The team performance as a whole was extremely positive and it is a shame to see how this incident has overshadowed our efforts in what was a very competitive cup final. Everyone’s focus is now on the next game and we must all now put this behind us.”The Italian’s position at Stamford Bridge remains under serious risk, even after his team’s more encouraging showing at Wembley against a City side who had thrashed them 6-0 two weeks previously. Yet the goalless draw was achieved playing far more pragmatic, counterattacking football more akin to the approach of previous Chelsea managers than Sarri’s preferred style.Defeat against Spurs could leave his team six points adrift of the top four, putting his job prospects in doubt with the England assistant manager and former Chelsea coach, Steve Holland, the favourite to take over on an interim basis until the summer if Sarri is dismissed seven months into a three-year contract.David Luiz had led the public show of support in their beleaguered head coach in the aftermath of Sunday’s loss, insisting he retains the support and respect of the group. “The coach has the power over the group and he has our respect,” said the Brazil centre-half. “For me, there is not a problem here with that. We all believe in his philosophy. We all believe in the way he wants us to play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1130a008549ef106818616afd1b58743d5d79ee4/244_50_2240_1343/master/2240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76a197701fb2a0659437fa31f8583c2","title":"leicester city to announce no 1 target brendan rodgers as new manager celtic football","story":"Brendan Rodgers will be named the new Leicester City manager. The 46-year-old is expected to be appointed within the next 24 hours after Celtic reluctantly gave him permission to talk to Leicester. It is understood that talks are at an advanced stage and that a deal in principle has been agreed between all parties, paving the way for Rodgers to take charge of his first game as Leicester manager at Watford on Saturday.Leicester had identified Rodgers as their No 1 target to replace Claude Puel several months ago but there were doubts as to whether the Northern Irishman could be persuaded to leave Celtic in the middle of the season, especially given the Scottish champions are on course to win a third domestic treble in succession.However, Puel’s dismissal on Sunday, on the back of a 4-1 home defeat against Crystal Palace the night before, has forced the issue. With the best part of three months of the season remaining, Leicester were eager to make a permanent appointment straight away and prepared to pay a compensation figure of £5m for Rodgers, who has previously managed in the Premier League with Liverpool and Swansea City.Although there was still an expectation that Rodgers would complete the season with Celtic, Leicester refused to be discouraged and made it clear that they wanted to fill the vacancy immediately. Chris Davies, Rodgers’s assistant at Celtic, and Kolo Touré, another member of the club’s backroom staff, will also move to the King Power Stadium.Rodgers is viewed by Leicester as the perfect manager to develop a talented group of younger players and to implement a clear playing philosophy – something that Puel failed to do during his time at the club. Although Leicester are 12th in the table, there is a feeling that the squad is capable of far more and that Rodgers, with his ability to coach as well as manage, ticks all the right boxes in that respect.From Celtic’s point of view, the timing is far from ideal and leaves them with sizeable shoes to fill – Rodgers won seven domestic trophies in the space of 32 months with the club – at a critical juncture of the season. It appears likely that Celtic will now turn to Neil Lennon, who left Hibernian at the end of January, as a short-term option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

Maybe we all need somebody who can be a cheerily oblivious outlet for our antagonismSix in 10 people say they have an archenemy at work, a survey of 7,000 workers has found. The remaining four, I can only assume, must be lying, lacking rich internal lives or between archenemies.No one takes work enemies more seriously than I do, and my perhaps controversial view is that they are not only inevitable, but, approached with the right mindset, a joy.Let me be clear: I am not talking about bullies, narks, saboteurs or anyone who actively strives to make your time at work unpleasant. (The most hated colleagues, according to the Totaljobs survey, were those who took credit for others’ ideas.) That is obviously unacceptable behaviour employers should be attuned to it and committed to flushing it out.I am talking about the colleague you cannot stand, who can be a cheerily oblivious outlet for your innate human pettiness.Of course, you’re a professional about it – you don’t let your private antipathy get in the way of your job, only your closest colleagues know about it and you don’t really wish them harm. In fact, you are extremely nice to them out of spite, while secretly delighting in their inconsequentially misaddressing an email, their saying “would of” instead of “would have” and their criminally unself-aware tweets about #Veganuary. The best workplace nemesis is someone you don’t work with directly, of approximately the same seniority as you, mostly oblivious and ultimately harmless. (I respect those who say the nemesis dynamic is by requisite reciprocal, but in a professional environment, they’re playing with fire.) Also, the dynamic is only sustainable in big offices, where you can surround yourself with people you like.The benefits of having friends at work, not only for employees’ morale and motivation but organisational function, are well known – I’d argue the same applies to enemies. You may well love your job, but let’s not kid ourselves. If work is ever going to be more than something you do for money, you need to be engaged in something other than the actual workaday business of it. A little low-stakes antagonism, lightly worn (and freely shod once you leave the office, lest it fester), motivates you to work harder and be better. If you’re a bit competitive and a lot petty, there is no greater motivation than winning – even if it’s against someone who has no idea that you’re in competition with them.They can even foster better relationships with colleagues: the office enemy of my office enemy is my work friend.The idea, basically, is to write your own workplace sitcom – and no one watched The Office for the paper sales. You need a work spouse (someone you can count on to cheer you on and commiserate with), an office crush (with whom you can harmlessly flirt over Gchat and time your trips to the water fountain with) and an office nemesis to spur you on to greatness.Right now, I am blessed with so many work husbands and wives that I am virtually a professional polygamist (and I also have a delightful office crush), but I am short one subplot. In response to the handful of colleagues who have messaged me this morning asking: “WHO IS IT???”, I regret to say that I am currently sans an office nemesis. But – who knows – perhaps, after reading this, one will make themselves known."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a6817766f9ffd39a502bdb1eb377a4238229b55/0_0_3500_2324/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c50aaa837b45787f12821c58b436c89c 1400w","title":"are you starting to find it difficult to work in the eu as a uk citizen due to brexit","story":"If you have encountered a problem applying for or moving to a new job because of Brexit, we’d like to hear from youAre you a UK citizen working, short or long-term, in an EU27 country, and have you experienced difficulties applying for or moving to a new job because of your new employer’s doubts about your legal status and right to work in the EU after Brexit?If so, we would like to hear from you.

Speaking to MPs on Monday night, a week after seven MPs who backed a referendum quit the party, Corbyn said Labour would first table its own version of a Brexit deal, including a permanent customs union.That amendment is set to be tabled to the government’s Brexit motion on Wednesday, when Labour will also whip to back another amendment tabled by Yvette Cooper and the Tory Oliver Letwin, which would legislate for a delay to the UK’s exit date in order to avoid no deal.May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a serious cabinet rebellion over that amendment this week.  reported last week that at least four cabinet ministers and almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll were ready to rebel and vote for the measure. The prime minister’s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit if the withdrawal deal does not pass by 12 March, though Cooper and Letwin’s backers have suggested they will reject that approach.Party sources said Labour would not introduce or back any amendment for a second referendum this week, but see the crunch point at the next opportunity – likely to be the next meaningful vote on the Brexit deal that May has promised to hold by 12 March.It is highly unlikely Labour’s amendment on its own Brexit deal will pass on Wednesday, making it almost inevitable the party will move to back another referendum.Corbyn told MPs that Labour “cannot and will not accept” May running down the clock towards no deal. “One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal,” he said.“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Yet recriminations came from leave-supporting Labour MPs almost immediately in the private meeting on Monday night. John Mann, a Brexit supporter, said the decision to back a second referendum would cost Labour in the Midlands and the north. “The price will stop you being prime minister,” he told the meeting.Outside the meeting, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said he had “deep reservations” about the possibility of a second referendum and suggested it would not pass the House of Commons.“I think it would be deeply isive. It has a corrosive impact on the sovereignty of parliament and it is not clear to me still what should be on the ballot paper,” he said.It is understood that about a dozen shadow ministers could consider their positions if Labour whips MPs to back a second referendum.Those who vocally oppose a second referendum include the shadow justice minister Gloria de Piero, the shadow housing minister Melanie Onn and shadow education minister Tracy Brabin as well as backbenchers including Caroline Flint, Gareth Snell and Lisa Nandy.Seventeen Labour MPs, including eight shadow ministers, voted against or abstained on Cooper’s previous amendment to extend article 50 last month.Future Labour support for a second referendum could come in the form of backing for a proposed amendment to the meaningful vote proposed by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.That proposal would approve May’s deal subject to a fresh referendum, though senior Labour officials are thought to be uneasy about backing any amendment that endorses the Tory Brexit deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a1d7a8aa8985dc1694e7ab97e0501cefac69fe/0_20_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be7ca74c3b44b72d109c8a7d292a2933","title":"keir starmer labours brexit stance is either credible deal or remain","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary tries to clarify party line after Corbyn backs new referendumKeir Starmer has stated unequivocally that Labour will back a second EU referendum with remain on the ballot if Theresa May’s deal gets through parliament.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the shadow Brexit secretary also took a thinly veiled swipe at some in Jeremy Corbyn’s office by urging the public to listen to elected MPs on the issue rather than advisers.The Labour leader finally threw his party’s weight behind a second referendum on Monday night, but there remains doubt about the wording of the question that would be put to the public.Starmer insisted the party agreed on the gist of the wording. “A public vote ought to be between the option on the one hand of a credible leave deal and on the other hand remain … That deal should be subject to the lock of a public vote,” he said.“Precisely what wording that is will obviously have to be decided by parliament, but that’s the basic choice.”On Monday, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, told Channel 4 News she and Corbyn would be campaigning to remain in the EU if there were a second vote. It was reported later that a source in Corbyn’s office claimed Thornberry had “misspoke” during the interview.She dismissed this as “nonsense” and was backed by Starmer on Tuesday.He said: “I don’t know who said what. What I do know is that you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night setting out what the position is that we agreed as the Labour party.”For the avoidance of doubt, Starmer added: “I’m telling you what was in the official briefing from my office and Jeremy’s office to Labour MPs last night. So there is no question that it should be between a credible leave option and remain.”Starmer said he would back remain in a second vote, but was more cautious than Thornberry about Corbyn’s stance.“I would vote for remain. Jeremy will obviously speak for himself, but he voted remain last time and he like me has attacked the prime minister’s deal uphill and down dale,” he said.Starmer said Labour could not guarantee backing a second referendum until the party had tried to win support for its own soft Brexit alternative to May’s deal.“We will put that proposition up for a vote on a customs union and single market alignment this week. If it doesn’t go through, we the Labour party will either put down ourselves or support an amendment in favour of a public vote to protect us against what will be a damaging Tory Brexit, or even worse, no deal,” he said.The Labour MP John Mann warned Corbyn risked being ditched by voters over the party’s “absurd” shift to support a second referendum.“Voters won’t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg. It didn’t end very well for him on tuition fees,” he told Today.“Our manifesto was unambiguous – we would accept the result of the referendum. A second referendum doesn’t do that and the voters – in very, very large numbers – will not accept that.”Asked about opposition to a second referendum within Labour, Starmer said: “I am well aware of different views across my own party and across parliament on pretty well all Brexit issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fda52226dfc131075871d9aff6e275d70969e605/0_116_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317fc5d411415cea2905a8ad8b321fff","title":"brexit latest news developments theresa may chairs cabinet amid reports she is about to announce u turn on giving mps potential vote to extend article 50 politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s statement to MPs about Brexit, and the possibility of the Commons getting a chance to vote against no dealThis is from the Financial Times’ George Parker, who flags up the next obvious question if Theresa May does announce that she will give MPs a vote on extending article 50 if her deal has not been passed by 12 March.This is from Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tory MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, on the subject of extending article 50.Baker is quoting a  article (paywall) by Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister. Varoufakis was in favour of remain during the EU referendum, but he is a fierce critic of Brussels, because of his experience negotiating with the EU during the Eurozone crisis, and in his article he argues that the UK’s best hope of getting a good deal from the EU would be to back no deal, or a permanent customs union. These are the two options most likely to force the EU to engage, he argues.On Sky’s All Out Politics Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, said that the government did ever end up offering a referendum with a choice between remain and Theresa May’s deal (as Labour is proposing - see 9.35am), he would abstain. He said:When it would put to him that this would suit his opponents, Farage went on to suggest that leavers should organise a mass abstention, in the hope of delegitimising the result. “You have to have a certain level of turnout for any referendum to be valid,” he said.The Labour Brexiter John Mann told the Today programme this morning that Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to endorse a second referendum was “absurd”. He explained:Voters won’t have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg, it didn’t end very well for him on tuition fees.Our manifesto was unambiguous, we would accept the result of the referendum. A second referendum doesn’t do that and the voters - in very, very large numbers - will not accept that.The move would be “catastrophic to Labour in the Midlands and the north”, Mann added.On the Today programme this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, confirmed that, if Theresa May’s Brexit plan gets approved by parliament, it is Labour’s policy for it to be subject to a referendum, with remain an option. He said:When it was put to him that a Labour party source told journalists last night that the party would not favour a referendum with May’s deal or remain as the two options, Starmer replied:I don’t know who said what. What I do know is you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night, setting out what the position is we agreed as the Labour party.The Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya has been released from prison after serving a month of her sentence for perverting the course of justice, the Press Association reports. Onasanya, who was expelled by the Labour party after she conviction, was driven out of HMP Bronzefield in Ashford in Surrey this morning. She was jailed for three months at the Old Bailey on January 29 after being convicted of perverting the course of justice by lying to avoid a speeding charge.On Sky’s All Out Politics, asked about the reports that Theresa May will promise MPs a vote on extending article 50 if they do not pass a Brexit deal by 12 March, Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, said he would want to hear what May actually proposed. But he also pointed out that in the past she had cancelled a vote she had previously promised, as she did before Christmas when she postponed the original vote on her deal.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn don’t have much in common, but they both deserve to be recognised as among the most stubborn iniduals to hold high political office in recent times. And that makes what we are witnessing today all the more remarkable. Within 24 hours, they both seem to be engaged in remarkable policy shifts on Brexit. Corbyn has finally given the firm commitment to Labour backing a second referendum that he has been resisting for months (although the small print is important - more on that later). And, in an even bigger U-turn, May seems poised to promise MPs a vote on extending article 50.The Evening Standard first reported this yesterday, but details are sketchy and it seems that much will depend on what is actually decided at cabinet, which starts in half an hour. But there are multiple reports this morning saying that May will today confirm that, if the Commons does not pass a Brexit deal by March 12, MPs will get a chance to vote to extend article 50. Here is an extract from the Financial Times’ story (paywall).Mrs May’s allies hope that business leaders will rally behind the prime minister as she rules out a cliff-edge exit on March 29 the prospect of a disorderly exit has alarmed and infuriated corporate Britain. “It’s taken a lot of hard work to get this far,” said one cabinet colleague. “We need a wall of support for the PM to get this through the cabinet.” Another minister said that an “explosion is guaranteed” from Tory Brexiters when they are confronted with Mrs May’s new strategy, which will ramp up pressure on Eurosceptics to back the prime minister’s tweaked exit deal ...According to the prime minister’s allies, if the Commons rejected the deal again then Mrs May would give MPs a vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or to opt for “a short extension” to the article 50 exit process.This is from the Sun’s version.But No10 is now sure that Remain Tory ministers along with dozens of backbenchers comfortably have the numbers to defeat the Government in a showdown Commons vote on Wednesday.Unless the PM acts, as many as 60 Tory MPs are expected to back a cross party bid lead by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory grandee Sir Oliver Letwin to enforce a Brexit delay to avoid a No Deal cliff edge in just 31 days time.A senior government source who is aware of the PM’s thinking said: “The decision for her now is how to avoid the worst case scenario, not what do we want to do.“That worst case scenario is losing control of Brexit if Cooper-Letwin passes, and that would be catastrophic.”And here is an extract from what ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston, posted on Facebook about this last night.As of tonight there was still uncertainty among her colleagues whether she would press the button on the volte face and put it to her cabinet tomorrow morning - where it will cause a furious row between Brexiters and remainers.The Brexiters are acutely aware that MPs would almost certainly vote to force the prime minister to delay Brexit and therefore prevent a no-deal departure on 29 March.However absent that promise of a vote for MPs, which the PM is expected to make when addressing the House tomorrow afternoon, somewhere between 15 and 25 ministers and parliamentary private secretaries - who hate the prospect of a no deal exit from the EU - were set to resign.Some 23 of these government rebels - who are led by David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark - met tonight. And 18 of them made clear they were ready to rejoin the backbenchers.On the Today programme this morning David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, refused to comment on the reports. But Margot James, the culture minister and one of three ministers who have written a joint article for today’s Daily Mail saying the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit, confirmed that she was willing to resign over this issue. She said:All of us were agreed that we couldn’t be part of a government that allowed the country to leave the EU without a deal. As D-day approaches, I think we felt honour-bound to actually do something to help prevent such catastrophe.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on household income inequality.10am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.11.30am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons.After 12.30pm: May gives a statement to MPs about Brexit.At some point today we are also expecting the government to publish its assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit, promised two weeks ago to avert a defeat on an amendment tabled by Anna Soubry demanding the release of the information.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit, and May’s statement.

What drives someone to take the ultimate risk?The greatest rock climber in the world is climbing the greatest rock in the world. Alex Honnold is on El Capitan, free-soloing it – meaning no rope, no one else, just a man alone on a wall. He is at the crux, the most difficult section, known as the boulder problem, the main problem being that it is really, really hard. But he moves gracefully, balletically even: drive up off the left foot into the thumb press, roll two fingers over the thumb, switch feet, left foot out to a bad sloping foothold, switch thumbs, reach out left to a grainy rounded hold before launching into the karate kick … And that is where he slips and falls.Not 700 metres to his death, though, which is what would have happened if he was on the real El Cap, in Yosemite, California. He is actually in Vauxhall, south London, at a climbing centre where they have tried to recreate the hardest section of the route that Honnold really did climb, alone and without a rope. So this time he has fallen about two and a half metres on to a crash mat, nothing hurt except a little pride. “I’m dead,” he laughs. Hahaha.Alex Honnold, now 33, has been a legend in the sport for a while, with a rack of insane firsts and nobody-will-evers hanging from his harness (except he doesn’t usually wear one of those). With a goofy grin and a bad haircut, he has been fighting a single-handed battle against gravity, and winning. When, on 3 June 2017, he free-soloed the freerider route on El Capitan, the New York Times described it as “one of the greatest athletic feats of any kind, ever”.Then the film about that climb – Free Solo – came out, and the world outside the climbing community sat up and took note. It is a brilliant, beautiful film – not just the story of an incredible physical performance (with some of the most buttock-clenchingly tense viewing you’re ever likely to squirm through), but a very human story of a remarkable, beguiling character. Oh, and it’s a love story, too. It has just won the Oscar for best documentary, after winning a Bafta earlier in the month.Honnold is in town to promote the film. You can’t keep him away from climbing for long, though, even in the city, and this is where he comes when he is in London. It’s not unlike the climbing wall where he started off in Sacramento, he says. There is a buzz about the place among the men and women who work here – imagine Lionel Messi dropping in to your amateur football club.They have recreated this section of the boulder problem in his honour. But it’s not quite right: this hold needs to come in a bit, the thumb press presses the wrong way, there shouldn’t be a foothold on the end of the karate kick … He is telling them where everything should be from memory. He knows every millimetre of this section of El Capitan, practised it 40 or 50 times with a rope before attempting it without. That – the meticulous practice and preparation – is the key to not falling. If the recreated boulder problem was exactly the same as the real boulder problem, it wouldn’t have been a problem.Honnold climbs because he loves it he grew up doing it. “I like the movement, I like swinging, it all feels kinda playful and fun.” But why without a rope, when the stakes are so much higher? He has obviously been asked the question a thousand times before, but he still seems to think about it. “It’s like when I say that climbing is all about fun free soloing is sort of the extreme. If you do something for fun all the time, every once in a while you want to have consequences.”I speak to Jimmy Chin, who filmed a lot of Free Solo and co-directed it with his wife, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, after a screening of the documentary. A hugely accomplished climber himself, he says he wouldn’t attempt to free-solo a single pitch of El Capitan, but he understands what drove Honnold. “If you had a superpower and you could fly, you would probably do it, right?” he says. “The drive and ambition to do something that pushes you, that you love – it’s hard to put that away and not use it.”Chin is in no doubt about what it meant to free-solo El Capitan, which he compares to an Olympic gold medal gymnastics floor routine. “But the floor routine is four hours long. And every single move, every second, you have to be performing perfectly, knowing that if you make a single mistake you would die.”Honnold knew he wasn’t going to fall off El Capitan because of the practice and preparation. What about all the other people mentioned in the film who have died free-soloing – people he knew, such as Ueli Steck? “He died climbing a mountain at 7,000 metres in the snow wearing crampons – it’s a completely different experience,” Honnold says. Another climbing legend, John Bachar? He did die free-soloing, but “with extenuating circumstances. He’d been in this car accident and had nerve damage. He died soloing on something quite easy.”Dean Potter, a free-soloing pal of Honnold’s who also features in the film, died while Base jumping: jumping off a cliff with a parachute. Honnold wouldn’t do that, “because everyone dies, honestly”. He explains the difference in risk. With Base jumping, you die unless everything works perfectly – the parachute opens, you’re facing the right way when it does etc. With free-soloing, you’re OK unless something goes badly wrong.If any of this talk about death – of people he knew and potentially his own – comes across as unfeeling or callous, it doesn’t seem like that at the time. He just has a matter-of-fact directness that is arresting, but also honest and refreshing. He is not an adrenaline junkie thrill-seeker: he climbs because he loves to climb, not because of the danger of death. A lot of work goes into minimising that danger.He boulders as we talk, picking his way up, sometimes three metres above me, stretched out, a human bridge between a couple of smears on the wall, then back down at ground level again. I have a go and I can’t even get on to the beginning of the boulder problem the idea of 600 metres of air below me is ridiculous. I try something easier and Honnold offers advice and encouragement from below. I do a bit of outdoor climbing, but I get scared high up on exposed routes. Keep on doing it until the fear goes away, he tells me.Eventually, we sit down. It’s freezing, so he puts on a jacket by a well-known outdoor clothing company. It pays him about what a well-paid dentist gets, he says in the film. Since then, it has become more “like a really successful orthodontist”, he admits. Anyway, he is no longer a dirtbagger living in a van, but has a house in Las Vegas. If Vegas seems an unlikely place for him, it has nothing to do with the city itself and everything to do with the fact it is surrounded by some of the best climbing in the country.He lives with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, a life coach who plays a big part in Free Solo. That is the love story bit, although it’s not easy dating a guy who crawls out of bed before dawn to go and hang off cliffs. When he reached the top of El Capitan after three hours 56 minutes (to put it in perspective, it took a German team of professional climbers doing it with ropes four days), with the biggest grin of his life, he called McCandless. “I love you,” he just about managed to say, awkwardly, before ruining it by downgrading it to: “I appreciate you.”He’s not really an I-love-you kind of guy, is he? “No, no,” he agrees. Nor much of a hugger. That comes into the film, that there wasn’t much hugging in his family growing up. One critic described it as “a cautionary study of what can happen when you don’t hug your children”. But Honnold has taught himself to hug, he says, and he is getting better at it. Can I get one? Sure. We stand up and embrace there is even a little shoulder- patting going on. “That’s nice, huh?” he says. It is – big strong arms.The no-huggy thing is part of something else going on in the film. He doesn’t always seem switched on to McCandless’s emotional expectations. His remark that previous girlfriends have accused him of having a personality disorder his obsessiveness the extraordinary detail of his preparations and the pages and pages of notes the fact that he began to climb alone in Yosemite because it was easier than asking people to climb with him his mum saying his dad had Asperger’s … It is implicit rather than explicit, but you could easily come away from watching Free Solo thinking that Honnold might have a rubber-soled toehold somewhere on the spectrum.He recognises that people might think that, and that it is a seam in the film, and he is not surprised or in any way offended. He wouldn’t mind if he did have a spectrum disorder, but he doesn’t think he does and picks holes in some of the evidence. He was shy, is shy, doesn’t like talking to strangers much now (my hug is feeling more and more special), but he also wanted to climb on his own – there is a strong tradition of it in Yosemite. The obsessive focus and detail? Any elite climber would and has to do the same.He says he has no problem knowing what other people are thinking – McCandless, for example. “I can tell she would prefer something different but, you know, do I have to? Is she going to leave me? No. So you’re sort of like, well, I guess it’s not that serious.” Risk assessed, safe to continue, basically. He goes on: “I have no problem knowing what other people are thinking on a rational level I just don’t always necessarily care. I’m not necessarily compassionate, but I understand.” Again, it might come across as callous, but it’s also brutally frank.As for his dad (who died when Alex was 18) having Asperger’s, he disputes it. “Mum says that I think it’s slightly unfounded.” He was never diagnosed. “I would have for sure called him a kind of quirky man, and pretty quiet.”Is that what Alex is? “Yeah, totally.” He hasn’t sought a professional opinion for himself, although he once did an online test, which he realises isn’t rigorous. The result? “Totally normal.”As we talk, he is often distracted, looking around or over my shoulder. Not, I think, because he doesn’t like what I’m asking or because he’s finding the interaction awkward, but because there is something more interesting going on. We are, after all, at a climbing centre. It doesn’t matter if it is the centre staff trying out the El Cap bouldering problem (every now and then, there is the sound of body on crash mat – another tragic death, we laugh), or the woman from the PR company, who has never climbed before, attempting the easiest route in the house. “That’s it, keep straightening that leg, trust it, it’s not that high, yes, you can,” he calls up to her.Does he like teaching? “I like seeing people succeed,” he says. McCandless, he says, is now “pretty fricking good”. She even likes doing it, which is lucky, otherwise they wouldn’t see much of each other. Same if he – they – ever had kids: they would have to climb. “If they didn’t, it would be hard to spend quality time together,” he says.Speaking of kids, Honnold has to run – to a school where he is giving a talk. First, though, he has to try the boulder problem again. They have taken on board what he said, moved the holds to where they should be, so it’s near as dammit to the real thing. He switches thumbs, grabs the grainy hold, launches into the karate kick, and lands on the other wall – success.In Free Solo, it is a key moment, the completion of the karate kick, and he turns to the camera with the biggest grin. There are still 300 or so metres of near-vertical granite to scale, a fiendish crack to work his way up. But, for Honnold, that’s a walk in the park – he knows he’s done it and that he’s alive. Today he jumps down, thanks all the climbing centre guys, grabs his jacket and runs for the waiting car.Free Solo premieres on TV on National Geographic, Sunday 3 March at 8pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d2dbf39c6df68e96129d46e73737515880ebff/0_581_3468_2080/master/3468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dbc2024216cb1efefe1dc52f0028a98","title":"how we made hair the musical","story":"‘Some of the cast ate some pot brownies one night and ended up hanging on to each other saying: “Where is the audience?

They seemed like creatures from outer space, so open, loving and beautiful. They touched our hearts. The anti-Vietnam-war protests on the streets were dramatic and thrilling. Gerry and I thought we could write a show about all this.I’d seen a painting at the Whitney Museum, of a comb holding a clump of hair that had been pulled out.

Fate seemed to be at work with the show. Gerry was on a train one day when he met the producer Joseph Papp, who had a new venue in New York, the Public Theater, and needed a show to open it. Two weeks later, we had the job. The show needed actors with long hair but there was no such thing at the time, so we would approach suitable people in the street, tap them on the shoulder and say: “Excuse me, do you sing?” The songs we’d written really pushed the envelope and there was a mood of permissiveness among the actors, too. Once the show moved to Broadway, there was more and more drug use backstage. Whenever the fire marshal came round, the stage manager would get on the intercom and say: “Marti Whitehead, please report to the stage manager’s desk.” Then everyone knew to throw their joints away.The Public Theater wouldn’t let us do the nude scene, but our Broadway director Tim Horgan was all in favour. In fact, he changed it so that instead of just two people, the entire cast took their clothes off. I played Claude, the leader of the hippies, and Gerry played Berger, a free spirit – until we got fired from our own show. The play had opened a production in Los Angeles and we went over to visit, watching from the back of the theatre. We decided to take our clothes off during the interval and walk down the aisle naked.The producer heard about it and decided we were a liability. When we flew back to New York, we’d been fired and there were armed guards on the door of the theatre keeping us out. So we wrote on a bedsheet “We want our baby back!” and picketed the theatre. They let us back on stage eventually.After that, Gerry and I started fighting more and more. It had become too intense: we had to get away from each other. But we found our way back to each other as friends, even writing a second show called Sun, which has never been produced. Maybe someone will put it on before I die.It was a wonderful, exciting time. Everything was changing. I was working at the Night Owl Cafe in the Village when Jim and Gerry came in looking for musicians. I had long hair and was innocent-looking, and they asked if I could sing, dance or act. I said: “No. Who are you?” My friend talked me into auditioning so I sang With a Little Help from My Friends. They liked it, but they didn’t have a role for me – so they wrote a song, Frank Mills, for me instead.Jim and Gerry were yin and yang: Gerry was outgoing and wacky, Jim quiet and thoughtful. Galt was the grownup in the room. We became like a close-knit family – a tribe, as we called it. The nude scene didn’t bother us: we weren’t shy about our bodies. We were anti-war, of course, and went on the anti-Vietnam marches and to be-ins at the park. But they said we hated the soldiers, which just wasn’t true.Martha was born in 1970. When I began to show, they had me play the part of the pregnant girl, Jeanie. That was a lot of fun, but it became too dangerous because she has to go up a ladder. After Martha was born, she’d be backstage with me. Many stage managers have held her while I sang Frank Mills.A lot of the show is about masculinity and male friendship. Heather MacRae – who played Sheila, the woman caught in a love triangle with Claude and Berger – was magnificent. I remember sharing a dressing room with Diane Keaton and Melba Moore, too. They were getting their careers together while I was just having a good time. I never felt like acting was my calling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93cd74b2fda95d00a3854ebcbafd6928ab58442e/0_0_6263_4188/master/6263.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=42bc5ceb467a65a7b6166a80e6561d50 2020w","title":"canoe new zealand river whanagui maori legend","story":"The Whanganui is so important in Maori culture it has the legal rights of a person. A canoe trip along its forested valley proves a great way of getting to know itIf my canoe makes a noise when I smash sideways into the rock, I don’t hear it. The rapids drown everything. For a moment the canoe is stationary, then it fills with water and tips me out. I try to swim to the bank but make no headway against the current. I remember that the Maoris say their ancestors dwell in the river and I wonder if I am about to become intimately acquainted with them.I have spent three days on the Whanganui River in New Zealand’s North Island. The Whanganui is the country’s longest navigable river, yet it is notable for more than that – because this is a river that is also a person. In 2017, the local Maoris gained a ruling to give the river the legal status of personhood. “The river has always been a living entity to us,” Maori campaigner Gerrard Albert told me.He believes the river’s status will protect it: “Everyone has to be conscious that the river has the right to continue to be in a healthy state.”In 2014, the Te Urewera wilderness area on its eastern side also assumed the rights of a legal person. And last year nearby Mount Taranaki gained the same status. The Maoris believe there are no boundaries between themselves and the natural world: it is a continuum.The river’s representatives are now waiting for the results of a study into its wellbeing. There are concerns about pollution from agriculture and damage from hydroelectric power schemes. The representatives are also deciding how to allocate a NZ$30m (£16m) fund for environmental initiatives.The Whanganui rises near Mount Tongariro. According to Maori legend the river was created after Mount Taranaki ran away to its present position on the east coast and left a gash behind. Afterwards Mount Tongariro healed the wound with water and the Whanganui was born.My guide, Hemi Gray, grew up in the mountains. He’s a mountain of a man himself, with a monolithic torso and shoulders. We join the river at the way station of Whakahoro, where I’ve slept in former sheep shearers’ quarters at the Blue Duck Station.The pulsing melodies of bellbirds fill the air, and the view is of a valley packed with spiky cabbage trees, palms and giant tree ferns. Significantly, there are conifers, too. “You see conifers where there have been human settlements,” says Hemi. The area was farmed up to the 1950s before nature reclaimed it.As we begin canoeing I can see the forest continuing down the gorge. The high walls to either side and the saturation of greenery create an enclosed world. It’s intensely peaceful – often we go an hour or more without encountering another vessel – but there is always something to see.A pair of mallards chug past. I also see kereru, New Zealand’s large native wood pigeons, calling to each other. A large circular lesion in the gorge wall, framed by ferns and creepers, is Tamatea’s Cave, a sacred place named for an early Maori explorer. Soon after, a couple of wild goats trot along the bank and turn to stare at us.A day-and-a-half of paddling brings us to the Bridge to Nowhere, a monument to the failed hopes of settlers. The concrete bridge was finished in 1936, but within a few years most of the farms to either side had been abandoned. The bridge s a deep cleft over a tributary of the Whanganui, and in the water far below I can see eels more than a metre long and thicker than my arm (though not Hemi’s).That evening we stop at the Maori settlement of Tieke Kainga, where we’re to sleep in the community’s marae, or meeting house. After landing we take part in a powhiri, or greeting ritual, with its kaitiaki (), Woody Firmin. Part of this means us singing a song – our Frère Jacques is incongruous, but well-received. Then it’s on to the marae’s version of a hangi, or pit oven, for a meal Firmin prepared by wrapping chicken, lamb and sweet potato in leaves and letting them cook over hot stones.The final day brings the rapids. Oblivious to Hemi’s instructions, I paddle left instead of right and hit the rock. Fortunately he’s at hand to haul me, gasping, on to the bank. Notwithstanding my involuntary baptism I can see why – even though it is not actually a walk – canoeing or kayaking the Whanganui is one of New Zealand’s 10 Great Walks.

The image of the serious-faced Caucasian man clad in a long, flowing white beard and an even longer white robe is passé, as is the worshipful distance religious art tends to keep from him. The TV landscape of 2019 has allowed more room for an omnipotent deity than usual, all the while demystifying God as a person and idea. Sacrilegious? Maybe, but it has made for some fine entertainment (even if the creators might be consigning themselves to hell).Last week saw the premiere of Miracle Workers, a new sitcom from master of all things high-concept Simon Rich. The showrunner found success wedding sci-fi surrealism to romance with his previous series, Man Seeking Woman, and he mounted a quietly searing broadside against modernity with the New Yorker short story Sell Out, about a turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrant who finds himself transported to and summarily corrupted by present-day Brooklyn. Rich’s cockeyed sentimental streak meets his ambient feelings of despair about the now in his latest series, a bleak workplace comedy set at Heaven, Inc, where God reigns not-quite-supreme.Daniel Radcliffe and Geraldine Viswanathan lead the show as a pair of low-level employees working in the Answered Prayers department, a gig that technically makes them angels without the halos, hand-sized harps or glamour. But the real scene-stealer is Steve Buscemi as the man upstairs, a coup of casting combined with expert characterization from a veteran actor. Buscemi’s nasally voice and distinctive, unmistakable eyes lend themselves to a God who has been acting less than godly these days he’s more like a feckless CEO, all-powerful and yet utterly out of touch with what’s happening in his company.God mostly spends his days drinking beer and watching television, “delegating” tasks to underlings smarter and more hardworking than he is. Like so many horrible bosses before him, he makes absurd demands on a whim – after watching a smarmy standup routine from noisy atheist Bill Maher, God decides to explode the comedian’s penis – and watches as his flunkies tie themselves into pretzels trying to make his tossed-off wishes reality. His attention will get stuck on an inanity and refuse to budge, as in his ongoing obsession with a starting a “lazy Susan restaurant” in which diners revolve around a large island of food on a lazy river. The show begins with his decision to incinerate Earth, citing our many crises as fair cause to call the whole thing off, like we’re an integrated vertical with a poor profit margin. Oh, and God may or may not be illiterate.While Starz’s American Gods reverted to a more mythological interpretation of the ine, rooted in monotheistic traditions from Europe, Africa and Asia, it embraced the flaws in its holier characters just as fully. Whether Norse, Egyptian or Ethiopian, the assorted lowercase-g gods constantly give in to their baser impulses, indulging in pettiness, carnal desire or casual cruelty just to reestablish their supremacy over ordinary humans. (In far and away the most memorable sequence, the love goddess Bilquis takes the life of a sexual partner by increasing in size until the puny human can be fully subsumed by her vagina in what resembles a bizarre reverse-birth.) The source graphic novel’s author, Neil Gaiman, and showrunner Bryan Fuller were joined by their curiosity about the darker, primal, violent side of the canonized.The latest Gaiman adaptation, a miniseries take on Good Omens due on Amazon in May, will only solidify this paradigm further. The main characters are defined by their distance from orthodoxy an angel (Michael Sheen) and a demon (David Tennant) join forces to prevent the coming of the antichrist and the destruction of all creation on Earth, in no small part because the celestial beings have gotten rather accustomed to life among the mortals (Frances McDormand will be voicing God). Their impulses, vanities, and shortcomings place them far outside Judeo-Christian tradition.The exception proving the new rule of compromised gods arrived last year in the form of God Friended Me, of which CBS ordered a second season just last month. The successful dramedy takes the same “mission to do good” structure as cult favorite My Name Is Earl, but instead of ill-defined “karma” compelling the main character to perform kind deeds for strangers, the new series actually uses the G-word. Through Facebook, an account labeled only as “God” gives instruction from on high for an atheist podcaster (Brandon Micheal Hall) to save the souls in his orbit. The show-runners have made clear that they will refrain from specifying the nature of this God, that he’s the same object of worship for Christians as Jews as Muslims, united in his aloofness and inscrutability. The show revolves around the difficulty of discerning what a force that’s present but not present wants from you, a far cry from the perceptible, straightforward gods more character than concept.Certainty rarely has a place in religion, but these shows have suggested that being able to see and hear and talk back to God wouldn’t bring a person clarity anyhow. The old-fashioned morality of God Friended Me finds more certainty in the rightness and goodness of a picture of a cloud hosted by Mark Zuckerberg than those actually standing face to face with the Almighty in Miracle Workers. Rich’s most potent notion of all is that definitive proof of God would definitively prove he doesn’t know what he’s doing. What if, as they say, God was one of us?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a566234b7dbca1ada2f3042c93ffb78f77db3c67/0_67_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef987d80e34bcdbd5059d41a1dc6db86","title":"cuba approves new socialist constitution","story":"Cubans have overwhelmingly ratified a new constitution that reaffirms that socialism on the island is “irrevocable” while also legalising modest economic reforms instituted over the last decade.But in an unprecedented display of ballot-box dissent on the Communist-ruled island, more than 700,000 people voted “no” to the new founding document.The state had campaigned hard prior to the vote, casting a “yes” vote as an act of patriotism and a vote for the Revolution. TV, radio, posters, billboards and huge banners unfurled over public buildings urged the population to get out and vote. Even the electric ticker boards on buses chugging along Havana’s main thoroughfares read “I Vote Yes” (“Yo Voto Sí”).But the state was met with a surprisingly forceful challenge from an unofficial campaign against the new constitution.Evangelical churches concerned that the new constitution would create a pathway towards gay marriage hung banners reading “marriage: man + woman” from church walls, while religious activists daubed posters on lamp posts – a direct challenge to the state’s monopoly on public space.Although pastors did not explicitly call for a “no” vote, analysts say the church campaign mobilised non-religious, socially conservative sectors of the population to vote against the new constitution.And while state media gave no airtime or column inches to critical voices, #I’mVotingNo (#YoVotoNo) hashtags were trending on Facebook.While older citizens said they voted to support the government, a younger generation of Cubans, particularly those living in the cities, are more daring.Cuban journalist Mónica Rivero, 29, said: “I think the new constitution is too conservative. It crystallises the status quo rather than making changes.”Voting on the island is optional though strongly encouraged by the state and nosy neighbours. Cuba does not allow international observers to monitor its elections but citizens are allowed to watch the vote count at local polling stations.The new constitution reaffirms the Communist Party as the only legitimate political party on the island, defines access to health and education as fundamental rights, and claims that humans can only “reach full dignity” through “socialism and communism”.But there are also big changes. The new constitution introduces presidential term limits and enshrines the right to legal representation upon arrest.The document also gives constitutional backing to cautious pro-market reforms carried out since 2011. Private property is recognised, the rights of multinationals investing with the state are strengthened, and the market is recognised as a fact of life.Analysts estimate that one million Cubans now work in the private sector.Emily Morris, an economist from University College London, said the new constitution might open the path to stronger labour rights for those working in the island’s non-state sector.“Worker exploitation is already happening in the private sector,” she said. “But recognising private enterprise could be a step forward by facilitating improved regulation of relationships between employers and employees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716243e3079d3bdefc21900ead7dd346835606e3/0_132_4202_2522/master/4202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a368be8235b49d8de2f414ae673c94e8","title":"irans foreign minister javad zarif announces resignation","story":"Official who negotiated nuclear deal condemns ‘deadly poison’ of infighting in newspaper interviewThe Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, has unexpectedly tendered his resignation, condemning what he described as the “deadly poison” of infighting among Iran’s parties and factions.The veteran diplomat diplomat broke the news of his departure in an Instagram post on Monday night, prompting a fall in the Iranian stock exchange and a rearguard action by reformists, who called on Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani refuse to accept his departure.The surprise move comes as the landmark nuclear deal that Zarif negotiated with world powers stands on the verge of collapse after the withdrawal of the US.In an interview on Tuesday, published by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper, he said infighting was a barrier to formulating foreign policy, suggesting he may have resigned over pressure from hardline elements opposed to his role in negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal.“We first have to remove our foreign policy from the issue of party and factional fighting,” Zarif said. “The deadly poison for foreign policy is for foreign policy to become an issue of party and factional fighting.”Rouhani’s chief of staff tweeted to strongly deny reports that Zarif’s resignation had been accepted by the president.A majority of Iranian parliamentarians have signed a petition calling for Zarif to stay in office, according to spokesman for the parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy commission.There were also reports that Iranian diplomats internationally were threatening to resign in solidarity with Zarif and provoke a wider foreign policy crisis. In a statement Zarif urged other diplomats not to follow his course of action, saying the aim of his resignation was to strengthen his department.In his resignation note, Zarif, aged 59, offered an apology for his “shortcomings” and “inability to continue serving”.There were informed reports that Zarif was angry at being excluded from a meeting between the Iranian leadership and President Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian leader made a rare visit to Tehran on Monday. The future of Syria is critical to Iranian foreign policy, and Zarif’s exclusion from a meeting between Rouhani and Assad was taken as a snub that undermined the prestige and efficiency of the foreign ministry. It is said to be only one of a series of clashes between the office of the president and the foreign ministry.On Sunday, Zarif had criticised Iranian hardliners in a speech in Tehran, saying: “We cannot hide behind imperialism’s plot and blame them for our own incapability. Independence does not mean isolation from the world.”Zarif’s resignation leaves Rouhani, without one of his main allies in pushing the Islamic Republic toward more negotiation with the west. Analysts have said Rouhani faces growing political pressure from hardliners in the government as the unravelling nuclear deal further strains the country’s economy.Zarif, entirely fluent in English, is seen as the acceptable face of Iranian diplomacy to the west, which has made him the subject of relentless attack by hardliners, especially over his role in championing the nuclear deal.Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal last year, leaving Europe to make limited efforts to prevent powerful US sanctions destroying Iranian hopes of boosting trade with the west – the supposed benefit to the nuclear deal from the Iranian standpoint.European diplomats were aghast at the resignation potentially losing their chief interlocutor, and angrily condemning the US for pushing Zarif over the edge. One diplomat likened the US administration attitude to Marxist revolutionaries worshiping at the altar of change and disruption.The EU has long warned sanctions that cripple the US Iranian economy will only weaken reformists in Tehran, and not usher in the kind of democratic revolution that the Trump team seem to be seeking to engineer.Reacting to Zarif’s announcement, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tweeted: “We’ll see if it sticks. Either way, he and @HassanRouhani are just front men for a corrupt religious mafia. We know @khamenei_ir makes all final decisions. Our policy is unchanged … the regime must behave like a normal country and respect its people.”A state department official tweeted an unflattering gif of Zarif saying: “How do you know @JZarif is lying? His lips are moving.”Zarif served as Iran’s ambassador to the UN from 2002-07, first under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and then under the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Later, secret talks between the US and Iran in Oman became fully fledged negotiations over its nuclear programme. During the talks, Zarif met the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, more than 50 times – something unimaginable only years earlier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0154d5e97dabf0e016cf4bc30b8db3d68b7276a/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=948ae3218c5dea7d8ee9138135a2b8e2","title":"jorge ramos univision detained venezuela maduro interview","story":"Anchor, who has reportedly been released, asked question embattled leader did not approve of, according to Univision executiveThe Univision anchor Jorge Ramos has been detained in the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela, the network announced on Monday evening.The Mexican-born journalist was interviewing Venezuela’s embattled president Nicolás Maduro when he and his crew were detained after asking a question the combative Maduro did not approve of, according to a tweet by the network’s US president, Daniel Coronell. The team’s equipment had also been confiscated, Coronell said.Coronell later said Ramos and his team had been released and he had spoken to the journalist. The equipment as well as the material that upset Maduro were confiscated. Reuters reported that Venezuela was going to deport the group.Ramos told Univision that the offending line of questioning came when he showed Maduro images taken on Ramos’ phone of Venezuelans eating out of the trash to prove people were living a humanitarian crisis.Ramos is arguably the best-known journalist in the Spanish-speaking world. He has gained particular notoriety for regularly locking horns with Donald Trump, who had him ejected from a press conference while on the campaign trail in 2015. The have since sparred over the US president’s proposed border wall among other contentious issues.Maduro, who is fending off mounting international pressure to cede power to opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaidó, has been accused of regularly detaining journalists. Last month, two French journalists were held after filming outside Miraflores. Numerous local journalists have been harassed or detained in recent years.The US state department received word of the arrest of Ramos and his team and insist on their immediate release, Kimberly Breier, assistant secretary for western hemisphere affairs, tweeted.The move against Ramos drew swift condemnation from Human Rights Watch, with the advocacy group’s Americas director, José Miguel Vivanco, calling for the immediate release of Ramos and his crew.“The international community must be alert,” he tweeted on Monday evening, later adding that “Jorge Ramos and his team are surrounded by Maduro’s intelligence services (responsible for atrocities).”López Obrador has drawn criticism from some international observers for refusing to back Guaidó.The Mexican foreign ministry condemned the crew’s detention after their release on Monday night. “Our country calls for respect for freedom of expression and reiterates its obligation in defense of the security of Mexican citizens abroad,” a tweet read.Univision is the largest Spanish-language network in the US.

But after the opposition failed in a weekend bid to defy Caracas and bring aid into the country, he called on the international community to “keep all options open”.That hint at the use of military force won an enthusiastic response from hawks like US senator Marco Rubio, but sparked alarm elsewhere, particularly as Trump has previously mooted ordering an invasion.Speaking at an emergency summit of regional leaders in the Colombian capital Bogotá, Pence renewed the threat of intervention, describing Maduro as “a usurper”, and calling for a global push to oust him.“To leaders around the world: it’s time. There can be no bystanders in Venezuela’s struggle for freedom,” he said. “We hope for a peaceful transition to democracy, but as President Trump has made clear, all options are on the table.”But beyond the US, few appear willing embrace the prospect of violence. In Latin America, there is a painful and bloody history of US interventions, and the terrible fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq is another deterrent to the use of military force.An invasion would be complicated and bloody, with a strong chance of sliding into protracted civil war. Venezuela has armed forces that are more than 300,000 strong, thousands more members of pro-government gangs or guerrilla groups, complex terrain – and a government that still has some support from international partners including China and Russia.Brazil’s vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourão, said on Monday that under no circumstances would his country allow the United States to intervene militarily from Brazilian territory, even though the country’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro has previously vowed to do “everything for democracy to be re-established” in Venezuela.Colombian president Iván Duque, has also now ruled out intervention, according to sources in his administration. Chile and Peru were also among other regional powers opposing military action on Monday.There was similar concern across the Atlantic, where European nations including Spain and Germany made clear they considered the deployment of troops a line that should not be crossed.“Not every option is on the table,” the country’s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday, in a blunt rebuke to both Guaidó and US supporters of intervention.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, insisted there could be no military solution to a political crisis.“The origins of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela are political and institutional, hence the solution can only be a political one,” she said in a statement. “We reiterate our firm rejection and condemnation of violence and of any initiatives that can further destabilise the region.”The Lima group also said credible threats have been made against the life of Venezuelan opposition leader Guaidó and his family, adding that President Nicolas Maduro was responsible for Guaido’s safety.“We want to hold the usurper Maduro responsible for any violent action against Guaido, against his wife and against their relatives,” said Colombian Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo, speaking on behalf of the group.Pence said he would urge regional powers to freeze Venezuela’s oil assets and hand them over to Guaidó’s control. The opposition have reportedly already taken effective control of US-based refiner Citgo, one of the few remaining profitable assets of Venezuela’s state owned oil firm PDVSA.Earlier that morning the US announced it had added four regional governors to an already long list of sanctioned Venezuelans, and Pence said that tougher measures were still to come.“In the days ahead … the United States will announce even stronger sanctions on the regime’s corrupt financial networks. We will work with all of you to find every last dollar that they stole and work to return it to Venezuela.”But much of Venezuela’s government and industry are already sanctioned, making it harder for Guaidó’s allies to ramp up financial pressure on the regime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7553f5fb89f5411fd1f89bc4a5b5b8dea5d05576/534_165_2398_1440/master/2398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4eaac950f7f48fecb919855121f15ba","title":"canada jagmeet singh gets chance to take on trudeau after byelection win","story":"First non-white leader of major party in Canada enters parliament ahead of October electionJagmeet Singh, the leader of Canada’s New Democratic party, has won a critical byelection and a seat in parliament, ensuring he will lead the left-of-centre party in the country’s October federal election.Singh, the first non-white leader of a major party in Canada, was under immense pressure to win the highly anticipated race in Burnaby, a city east of Vancouver.“Friends, we made history today,” he told supporters. “When I was growing up, I could have never imagined someone like me running to be prime minister.”Calling the victory “incredible”, Singh pledged to fight for Canada’s middle class and took direct aim at growing fears of xenophobia in the country.The rookie leader, who has been seen as an energising force in Canadian politics, will have a place in the House of Commons, allowing him to spar with other leaders and the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ahead of the election.The victory was critical for the party leader: amid sagging poll numbers nationally and fundraising difficulties for the party, senior members had cast doubts over his future leadership had he not secured the win.“Jagmeet Singh has always been underestimated,” his brother Gurratan Singh tweeted as results were reported. “And he always proves them wrong.”Typically, leaders of federal parties in Canada decline to run competitive candidates when another leader is seeking a seat. The Liberal party, as well as the Conservatives and the People’s party, all ran candidates in the Burnaby South electoral district. The Green party chose not to run a candidate.The closely watched byelection was not without controversy. In January, Liberal candidate Karen Wang was forced to step aside after making racially charged remarks about Singh. “If we can increase the voting rate, as the only Chinese candidate in this riding, if I can garner 16,000 votes I will easily win the by-election, control the election race and make history!” she wrote on WeChat. “My opponent in this by-election is the NDP candidate Singh of Indian descent!”The text was widely condemned by both the NDP and the Liberals. Wang stepped down at the request of Trudeau.While the win is a relief for Singh, the electoral district of Burnaby South is widely viewed as an NDP stronghold.In two other byelections across the country, the NDP lost Outremont, handing over the Quebec seat once held by its former leader to the Liberal party candidate, Rachel Bendayan."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Postmortem expected to take place at Cork University HospitalControl practices criticised by health watchdog after CPE outbreak hits 17 patientsCatherine Murphy and R\u0026oacuteis\u0026iacuten Shortall concerned at allegation of backstory inaccuracyDriver, aged in his 60s, treated for non-life threatening injuries in hospitalAn investigation into the cause of the incident is ongoing, Irish Water saysLegislation aims to keep distressed borrowers in mortgage arrears living in their homesLondon to bring back direct rule in NI as administrative move in event of crashoutCouncil has identified four industrial areas it sees as \u0027new key growth areas of the city\u0027Social integration \u0026lsquohas failed\u0026rsquo due to funding capsGalway Safe app also can help city visitors stay safe near the River CorribNo national data on how many children in care come in contact with garda\u0026iacute, report saysLancet flags impact on staff, financing, availability of medicines and vaccinesAll three were involved in care of man (52) who died days after being admitted with chest painsDriver Eamon Kavanagh (16) believed to have died instantly when vehicle hit wallRight to same-sex marriage and abortion universal, Taoiseach tells Arab LeagueLetters issued by NTA in recent days brings total number of properties affected to 1,400Incident occurred at the village of Shelton, near ArklowSecret Teacher: We feel increasingly insecure about what we are meant to be doingParents are urged to check supplements for children following the findings of UK studyKiller Alan Hawe transferred money to bank account \u0027while his family were dead around him\u0027"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3806140.1551129203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundred more homes to lose part of gardens to bus corridors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardens of properties in Terenure are among those that will be affected by the BusConnects core bus corridor project.

These lie on the Clongriffin (120), Swords (110), Blanchardstown (100), Lucan (15), Liffey Valley (60), Greenhills (220), Kimmage (75), and Rathfarnham (255) to city centre corridors, along with Clondalkin to Drimnagh (15) and Tallaght to Terenure (40).The NTA announced last year a total of 1,300 property owners could lose part of their front gardens under the core bus corridor project. However, in recent months there were indications this figure could rise slightly.The authority is expected to publish details of the final six corridors on Tuesday afternoon. It has offered one-to-one meetings with affected property owners and is organising information and community forums for the final batch of corridors.The NTA has previously said those affected will lose on average one to two metres of their front garden but that some properties could lose up to four metres.

Mr Corbyn told Labour MPs that the party would also back a vote this week in the House of Commons that, if passed, would compel Theresa May to delay Brexit rather than leave the EU without a deal on March 29th.“One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal. That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country,” he said.Mrs May will make a statement on Brexit to MPs on Tuesday ahead of votes on a series of amendments on Wednesday, including one tabled by Labour MP Peter Kyle that would put the prime minister’s deal to a referendum. Labour will table an amendment outlining its own Brexit plan, including a permanent customs union but it is almost certain to be defeated.“If parliament rejects our plan, then Labour will deliver on the promise we made at our annual conference and support a public vote,” shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said.Possible delayLabour’s move comes as EU leaders, meeting in Egypt for an EU-Arab League summit, raised the possibility of a delay to Brexit by extending the article 50 process. Mrs May did not rule out a delay to Brexit but said it would not “deliver a decision in parliament”.Meanwhile, The  understands the British government is likely to reintroduce direct rule to Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit.The move is being planned principally because of a large amount of new legislation, regulations and government orders which will become necessary to deal with a no-deal Brexit, according to British and Irish sources who have been briefed on the plans.There is legal uncertainty surrounding the powers of civil servants in the North in the absence of the powersharing institutions, and British ministers and officials have been advised the legal changes necessary after Brexit may need to be done from London, necessitating a period of direct rule.Several Irish Government sources confirmed Dublin is aware of the plans, which have been suggested as an administrative necessity rather than a political move.Restoring Stormont The Department of Foreign Affairs did not comment directly on the prospect of direct rule but said the Assembly and Executive were “urgently needed in order to represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern”. The Northern Ireland Office said secretary of state Karen Bradley is “focused on working closely with the political parties and restoring the devolved institutions at Stormont”.Unionist parties have repeatedly urged the British government to introduce direct rule, but the move has been strongly resisted by the Irish Government. Sinn Féin and the SDLP also oppose the move.The British government has resisted the DUP’s request for the reintroduction of direct rule, though it was forced to introduce a “direct rule budget” for the North last year in Westminster to provide a legal basis for the continued spending on public services in the North under the direction of civil servants.But there are doubts about the legal basis for the extent of civil servants’ powers. A court judgment last year which found that Northern Ireland civil servants did not have the legal authority to sanction a controversial waste incinerator plant in Co Antrim has prompted caution by officials about the extent of their powers in the absence of the Assembly and the powersharing executive.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: EPABritish prime minister Theresa May will open the way for a delay in Brexit if MPs continue to block the exit deal she is negotiating with Brussels, a move aimed at heading off resignations by about a dozen pro-EU ministers.After insisting for months Britain would leave the EU on March 29th without a deal if none could be agreed, the prime minister will on Tuesday offer MPs the chance to take a no-deal Brexit off the table.Under Mrs May’s plan, to be presented to cabinet on Tuesday morning, MPs would be given a “meaningful vote” on a revised exit deal by March 12th. Mrs May is in talks with Brussels looking to win assurances that a contentious “backstop” plan for the Irish border will not force the UK into a customs union with the EU indefinitely.According to the prime minister’s allies, if the House of Commons rejects the renegotiated deal, Mrs May will give MPs another vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or to opt for “a short extension” to the Article 50 orce process.The prime minister’s allies are preparing for a furious backlash from Tory Eurosceptics when she announces the change in Brexit strategy in a Commons statement, scheduled for 12.30pm on Tuesday.The prime minister is also expected to face fierce opposition from Brexiter ministers at Tuesday’s cabinet. Rally Some ministers claim the UK could flourish after crashing out of the EU without a deal, in spite of some early disruption.Mrs May’s allies hope business leaders will rally behind the prime minister as she rules out a cliff-edge exit on March 29th the prospect of a disorderly exit has alarmed and infuriated corporate Britain.“It’s taken a lot of hard work to get this far,” said one cabinet colleague. “We need a wall of support for the PM to get this through the cabinet.”Another minister said that an “explosion is guaranteed” from Tory Brexiters when they are confronted with Mrs May’s new strategy, which will ramp up pressure on Eurosceptics to back the prime minister’s tweaked exit deal.Downing Street believes there is now a solid Commons majority against a no-deal exit, suggesting that if Tory Eurosceptics refuse to back her deal with Brussels next month, they could face the prospect of a delayed Brexit, at least for a couple of months.With the opposition Labour party now backing a second referendum, Tory Eurosceptics may fear that any delay in Britain’s departure could lead to mounting pressure for another public vote on EU membership to end the parliamentary stalemate.Mrs May’s shift reflects concerns that she has been facing the resignation of a dozen or so ministers - including cabinet members Greg Clark, David Gauke and Amber Rudd - unless she rules out a no-deal exit.The prime minister travelled back to London on Monday from an EU summit with Middle East leaders in Egypt, working on a Commons speech that will bring Brexit tensions in her party to boiling point.ResigningAs Europhile ministers met at Westminster to discuss tactics ahead of a Brexit vote in the Commons on Wednesday, one ally of the prime minister said: “The principal concern is to stop those people from resigning.”David Lidington, Mrs May’s de facto deputy, said on Tuesday he hoped that pro-EU ministers would not quit and that it was “important that the Tory party remains a broad church”.Speaking to the BBC ahead of the cabinet meeting, Mr Lidington also confirmed the government would publish its economic assessment of a no-deal exit, which he said would “impose considerable costs on the British economy”.Some pro-EU ministers believe Mrs May’s offer of a vote to delay Brexit if she cannot get her deal through the Commons is not good enough, raising the prospects of a tense cabinet meeting on Tuesday.“We need MPs to be given a free vote at the bare minimum,” said one ally of a Europhile minister, arguing that Mrs May could end up ordering her party to vote for a no-deal exit.Writing in Tuesday’s Daily Mail, three ministers - Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James - implored Mrs May to say that, if no-deal is agreed by parliament by March 13th, then she must seek a way to extend Article 50, the EU process under which the UK is meant to leave the EU on March 29th.The pro-EU ministers have signalled they are ready to back a parliamentary amendment by senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper that would allow the Commons to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Ms Cooper has been rallying support behind her amendment and Eurosceptic Tories feared on Monday Mrs May was about to cave in to pressure from the party’s Europhile wing by opening up the prospect of a delay to Brexit.Mark Francois, vice-chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, noted that activists at the Conservative national convention had voted by a margin of 5:1 last weekend against any delay to the scheduled departure date of March 29th. “I’m sure the prime minister and party chairman will have taken note of their advice,” he said.Donald TuskMeanwhile Donald Tusk, European Council president, on Monday added his name to a growing list of EU leaders pressing Mrs May to postpone Brexit. Mr Tusk said a delay was now the “rational solution” for Britain, given the short amount of time left to avoid a “chaotic” exit from the EU.Speaking after meeting Mrs May at Sharm el-Sheikh, Mr Tusk said postponing the UK’s departure would make sense because “it is clear there is no majority” for Mrs May’s Brexit deal in the Commons.His call was immediately rebuffed by Mrs May, who insisted it was still “within our grasp” to leave the EU with an agreement at the end of March.She rejected the case for an extension to Article 50.She also agreed with Jean-Claude Juncker, European Commission president, to wind up the EU-UK negotiations on a revised Brexit deal before the bloc holds its next leaders’ summit on March 21st. - The Financial Times Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Experts have found dangerous diseases can pass from the livestock to humansA parasitic disease which affects more than 200 million of the world’s poorest people is transmitted between humans and their livestock through hybrid flatworms, a UK-funded project has found. Schistosomiasis, a chronic disease caused by parasitic flatworms which leads to an intestine or urinary tract infection, is common in communities without access to safe drinking water and sanitation.While efforts to control the disease have been partially successful, they have been limited by the flatworms ability to rapidly adapt and evolve. But in an announcement on Monday, scientists working in West Africa said that growing hotspots of the disease are driven by the emergence of highly infectious hybrid parasites, formed when species of schistosome from both livestock and humans combine. The research finding, which the World Health Organisation have incorporated into treatment guidelines, will have a significant impact on stemming the transmission and spread of the disease.“This finding is really important in terms of public health and demonstrates the huge potential for science to really make a difference,” she added.From animal to human | Ten significant zoonotic diseasesThe research is among a number of projects releasing findings on Monday as part of a UK government strategy to invest in zoonotic diseases, which can be passed from animals to humans. Such illnesses, which can devastate livestock and could be the source of the next global pandemic, are estimated to have cost the world more than $20 billion directly and $200 billion indirectly between 2000 and 2010.  “A billion people around the world depend on farming and livestock as a source of income,” said Penny Mordaunt, International Development Secretary.“By protecting cows and chickens from infections and tackling diseases that spread from animals to humans – like avian flu – UK aid is protecting them, supporting their livelihoods and reducing the risk of pandemics that could reach our shores.” In a project in Tanzania, scientists found that the insecticides farmers used to control ticks and flies on livestock also prevented the transmission of sleeping sickness, a deadly neglected disease spread by tsetse flies, from wildlife to humans. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleAnother team identified a link between growing brucellosis infections and the rise of farming sheep and goats, which are becoming more popular to farm as they are less vulnerable to changing climates than cattle. “But what we also know is that animals, both wildlife and livestock, are an important source of new infections to humans. How we invest overseas has an impact on the UK as well as global health security.”Dfid also announced on Monday an additional £2.5 million for six projects in the Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems (ZELS) scheme, taking the total invested by the UK to over £23 million. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest news: Labour MPs in Leave areas in revolt over Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support for a second referendum Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhat is Article 50?

The majority of those who died were children under five.The Costa Rica Star reported that neither the boy nor his mother, 30, had been vaccinated.The father, 35, is reportedly not up to date with his vaccinations. The newspaper said the parents told a doctor in Costa Rica that other children at the boy’s school in France had contracted measles.A spokeswoman for the French health ministry confirmed that a French five-year-old boy in Costa Rica was suffering from measles.She said the measles vaccination had only been compulsory in France for children born on or after 1 January 2018, and the boy affected was therefore not covered by the requirement introduced by the current governmentCosta Rican authorities said they had informed their French counterparts so that they can track whether others in France have been infected.Costa Rica has not had a domestic measles case since 2006. The last recorded case brought in from another country was in 2014.The boy is being treated and both he and his parents will be held in quarantine for at least seven days at the Monseñor Sanabria Hospital in the port town of Puntarenas, near the Santa Teresa beach resort where they were staying. The family arrived in Costa Rica on 18 February.Andrew Wakefield was struck off in 2010The Costa Rican health authorities are trying to establish who may have come into contact with the boy at the resort, on his flight, or at a hotel in the capital, San José, where the family spent one night.The Costa Rican health ministry said 26 people known to have had contact with family have now been vaccinated. In a statement, the ministry said: “Our country enjoys very good vaccination coverage in general. However, in order to avoid particular cases and their possible complications, it is important that those in charge of minors ensure that children have the complete vaccination scheme.”In Britain, a paper published by a doctor in 1998 linking autism with the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella)  raised anxiety about the jab.The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, was struck off the UK medical register in 2010 for dishonesty and failing to act in the best interests of child patients.Brexit latest news: Labour MPs in Leave areas in revolt over Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support for a second referendum Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhat is Article 50?

One local police official who declined to be named told the  that the strike had taken place at Jabba, near Balakot, inside the Pakistani province of  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Damage said to have been caused in the Balakot area after Indian air force planes dropped their payloadVillagers in the area told Reuters they heard four loud bangs in the early hours of Tuesday but reported only one person wounded by shrapnel.We saw trees fallen down and one house damaged and four craters where the bombs had fallen, said Mohammad Ajmal, a 25-year-old who visited the site.Pakistan\u0027s military released photographs of a crater surrounded by trees in hilly terrain which it said was where the bombs had fallen.Indians set off fireworks to celebrate the strike“Facing timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force released payload in haste while escaping which fell near Balakot. No casualties or damage, said Maj Gen Ghafoor.He went on: “Under forced hasty withdrawal aircrafts released payload which had free fall in open area. No infrastructure got hit, no casualties.”Indian military sources said 12 French Mirage 2000 fighters crossed the line of control on their raid into Pakistani territory at around 3.15am local time.  Accompanied by an IAF airborne early warning and control aircraft and a mid-air re-fueller, the Mirages reportedly employed 1000kg precision guided munitions or PGMs to hit their targets in a mission that lasted a few minutes.   Pakistan\u0027s government said it would hold an emergency meeting to discuss the incident and in the past has said it would retaliate against any aggression from Delhi.Tensions between the neighbours have been raised since at least 40 Indian paramilitary police were killed in a suicide bombing on their convoy near Pulwama in Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.Narendra Modi faces a general election this spring and has come under intense domestic pressure to respond to an attack he says was carried out by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad.Both sides claim Kashmir, which is ided between the neighbours by a heavily militarised line of control. Rivalry over the region has led to two of their three wars.Prakash Javadekar, India\u0027s human resource development minister, said: This was a necessary step for the defence of the country, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given the armed forces a free hand. The whole country stands behind the armed forces.Pakistan\u0027s foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned India not to challenge Pakistan and said better sense should prevail in Delhi.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Brexit latest news: Labour MPs in Leave areas in revolt over Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support for a second referendum Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhat is Article 50?

Britain is the fattest nation in Western Europe, with rates of obesity rising even faster than those in the United States.Two in three adults are overweight or obese.Experts said many cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed by healthy eating, being more active, and losing weight if overweight.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Millions of Type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented if we help people understand their risk and how to reduce it. Even though the older people get the more likely they are to have Type 2 diabetes, it is never too early to know your risk so that you can make changes to prevent or delay it.”The charity is urging those aged 40 or over to have a free NHS health check offered by GPs.It also said their own Know Your Risk online tool could help people to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Mr Agnew said: “The signs of Type 2 diabetes are often not obvious, that’s why spotting them early can be life-changing. Early diagnosis means that fewer people will experience diabetes-related complications such as sight loss, amputation, kidney failure, stroke and heart disease, because they could seek support to manage their condition effectively as soon as possible.“We urge people over 40 to get an NHS Health Check and we advise everyone to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.”Experts said symptoms of diabetes - which include going to the toilet a lot, being really thirsty, feeling more tired than usual and losing weight without trying -  can be easy to miss especially in the early stages.The condition can go undetected for many years, with one in three cases not diagnosed until they have developed complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.Under NHS plans, 5,000 people will be put on 800 calorie-a-day liquid diets in a bid to reverse the disease.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said children should be warned in school about the risks of diabetes, with diagnosis now happening at an ever-younger age.He said: “Telling them that they could lose a leg or go blind from the disease if they fail to look after their health might seem extreme but it\u0027s the truth.”Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity said: “The growing obesity epidemic is dangerous for the nation’s overall health and worrying for the NHS, fuelling growing numbers of people with Type 2 diabetes as well as costing taxpayers billions every year.This is exactly why the NHS Long Term Plan sets out radical action to tackle this growing problem by expanding the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme so that 200,000 people every year can benefit and introducing a pilot of very low calorie diets that have been shown to put Type 2 diabetes into remission in a significant proportion of those that already have it, he said.Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “This dramatic increase in the number of people living with Type-2 diabetes is likely to spiral further as obesity rates continue to rise. The good news is that we can do something to halt this epidemic.Strong measures from Government and meaningful action from the food and retail industry could transform our environment into one that encourages healthy options. This is why we need the Government to fully implement measures in its childhood obesity plan including restricting unhealthy food promotions and a 9pm watershed on junk food advertising.”Brexit latest news: Labour MPs in Leave areas in revolt over Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support for a second referendum Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhat is Article 50?

Whether it will be record-breaking again, we\u0027re not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close.The day will likely start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about 19 or 20 degrees.North-west Wales and London are most likely to feel the highest temperatures.The warmth follows last February\u0027s Beast from the East, which plunged temperatures below freezing and brought heavy snowfall across the country.Cooler temperatures expected from Wednesday onwards will be still above average for February, Mr Miall said.Heavy showers are possible on Thursday as temperatures struggle to get above 11C (51.8F) or 12C (53.6F).Friday, March 1, will mark the first day of meteorological spring and is expected to be mostly dry before a wet weekend.Mr Miall added: The weekend doesn\u0027t look great, it\u0027s looking wet and windy across the country.There\u0027s lots of uncertainty over the details because it\u0027s still a long way off but wet and windy seems to be the theme through many areas.Monday\u0027s record highs were likened to a climate breakdown by Green MP Caroline Lucas.Mr Miall said: This kind of event is what climate change would expect but we can\u0027t directly relate it to climate change.Brexit latest news: Labour MPs in Leave areas in revolt over Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s support for a second referendum Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhat is Article 50?

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

The vast majority of MOO’s sales are in the huge North American market, now accounting for 75 per cent of their revenues.In addition to its well known cards, the company’s range also includes hard- and softcover notebooks and business cardholders, among other things. Its London headquarters have recently moved from a warehouse in Shoreditch to a 35,000 square foot space down the road in Farringdon, which comes complete with an ice-cream machine, pool tables and a “library” – a giant bookcase, where MOO employees can bring in books to place on shelves.Created with Sketch.Hot desks: The coolest office spaces in the world Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.So it might be hard to imagine the first iteration of the business was a bit of a flop, with the company nearly dying in late 2005.What changed? A little creativity and a lot of persistence.Born and raised in north London, Moross, now 40, describes his younger self as more creative than studious.“It wasn’t like I wanted to be a policeman or a firefighter. I didn’t have a clear sense of what I wanted to do,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Retrospectively, it’s interesting that no one ever talks about becoming an entrepreneur at school. I remember doing career coaching and going to job fairs, and entrepreneurship was very underrepresented as an option,” he adds.Moross attended Sussex University to study philosophy and politics – a course he enjoyed, although he wasn’t inclined to make a career out of it. “I wasn’t interested in becoming a politician, and professional philosopher isn’t that much of a job,” he says.After a brief spell at the BBC he joined a startup called Sorted, a tool that told users about the hidden places – from coffee houses to bookstores – in their neighbourhood.The business eventually ran out of money and closed in 2001, prompting Moross to get involved with Imagination, a design agency.“What I loved at Imagination was working on big brands with smart people. But what I was missing in that role was being able to design products and make products better and more exciting. I didn’t want to do the campaign around the car, I wanted to make it.” he says.All of MOO’s products are sold via its websiteIt was 2004 when, during a sleepless night, Moross first had the idea to launch a startup selling paper cards. His first enterprise – the rather ambiguously named Pleasure Cards.“MOO was once Pleasure Cards. A great idea with a horrible name\u0026nbspthat didn’t work for all sorts of good reasons,” he admits.“The idea was to create a business card for your social life – to give out at a party, say, instead of in a business meeting.”Set up with £100,000 of seed finance from angel investor Robin Klein (who is still on the board of MOO today), the idea never took off.“By the end of the first year of business we were quickly running out of cash and people didn’t understand the concept. “I thought that instead of making these social cards, we should start printing for social networks, help people put their photographs on paper, give them access to design tools in order to make their brands look good.”The company was saved by a lucrative tie-up with photo-sharing website Flickr, which allowed users to print their pictures onto the business cards – sparking a lot of interest from investors.The promise of real revenue was enough to secure another £5m in investment and that was when MOO as we know it today was born.In the age of smartphones, the process of handing out a physical card with your information on it can seem remarkably outdated. But\u0026nbspthe digital revolution actually gave new life to one of the world’s oldest industries.Moross says: “Business cards might be 300 years old but without digital technology our business wouldn’t exist. We sell 100 per cent of our products through the website.”“MOO cards can also carry a different image on every single card, thanks to the digital printing press.“It show that, in a digital world, good quality physical objects still matter. Meeting someone is a much more special experience than receiving an email. When you meet in person, you want to be remembered and our hope is that our card helps you make that connection.”That is not to say that MOO has not made a few digital updates since its launch. In 2015, the firm released a new range of cards embedded with near-field communication technology that connects it directly to a web page or social media network when tapped with a smartphone.To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value. We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.MOO is also continuously trying to improve its green credentials and sticking its nose into the world of eco-friendly papers.In 2017, the company collaborated with Mohawk Fine Papers to take discarded cotton T-shirt scraps and give them new life as premium business cards.Usually, the scraps left behind from a T-shirt go to waste. But MOO takes these bits of fabric and uses a traditional printing technique to turn it into a high-quality paper.“To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value,” Moross says.“We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.“In the case of cards made out of cotton, many of our competitors already have eco paper – but we took one step further to create a new type of better quality green paper.”At about £14 for a pack of 50 original cards and £25 for a pack of luxe cards (printed on extra-thick luxury paper), MOO cards are a premium product. But they remain a cheaper option for those looking for customised business cards without the need to enlist a designer.“To some extent, if all you need is very cheap business card, you can just write an email to that person with your signature or write your number on a piece of paper.“But professional design is expensive and hard to access. So we talk about great design for everyone and we think about how to use technology to make the design cheaper and the software accessible or how we can help professional designers make their brand stand out.”A View from the Top: Jonathan Sattin, founder of Triyoga A View from the Top with insurance boss Amanda BlancA View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityWhen MOO was first founded, the team, which then consisted of just eight people, decided they would gather for a staff lunch on a weekly basis.Fifteen years later, the tradition endures, with employees being treated to free lunch every Friday.Moross, a keen photographer who has visited more than 60 countries, wants employees to have a life outside their jobs, believing this only increases productivity and creativity.“I tend not to work on weekends and I switch off very easily. You’re failing at your job if you’re 15 years in and you’re still working every hour of the day. You’re either failing at your job or you’re failing at your life and probably robbing your team of the things they could be doing.“I want people to come to work and be themselves. No one has to wear a suit and tie unless they want to, they can wear what they would at home – providing they wear clothes, of course.”Refreshingly, for a tech veteran who has little to prove to anyone, Moross can’t seem to rest on his laurels and is already looking to the next steps. “It’s always about pushing the business further. “This year, we’ll be expanding our product range and building much more for professional designers. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to building a good, strong, sustainable business.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The company’s finance director John Bason said there was a “real possibility of food shortages” in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.“A Brexit where there is no agreement would be very disruptive and people need to understand that and the effect it would have on food,” Mr Bason told Bloomberg. His remarks followed ABF’s latest trading update in which the company reported that Primark sales were set to rise by 4 per cent in the first half of the year. The group is expecting to record growth across all businesses, including brands such as Ryvita, Dorset Cereals and Ovaltine, except its sugar arm, which has been in decline for years.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phones are difficult to buy in some counties like the US, which has repeatedly said the phones are unsafe.But it said those same technologies that have proven so controversial – the 5G networks that it is looking to provide in the UK and elsewhere – mean that this phone is quicker than any other.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we can do that, then the whole thing will take off and there will be thousands of companies doing creative things.”Blue Origin has already carried out several successful flights of its New Shepard reusable rocket and the company plans to use it to take people into space later this year.Despite similar ambitions by SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, Bezos insisted\u0026nbspat the New York event that it is not a race, stating, “We will fly when we’re ready.”He also stated that his goal for Blue Origin is different to that of Musk, who has consistently said that he wants to send people to live on Mars.Bezos has been reinvesting money he made at Amazon since he started his space exploration company Blue Origin more than a decade ago (Getty)Musk even predicted last year that there is a 70 per cent chance that he would go to Mars himself.

Because it’s a garden paradise compared to Mars,” Bezos said.“We want to go to space to protect this planet.

Notice anything about that sentence?\u0026nbspOr what about this, a brilliant snapshot of the works of TS\u0026nbspEliot by WH\u0026nbspAuden: “T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I’d assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.”As per the previous, it’s a palindrome, one of those weird and wonderful linguistic constructs that reads exactly the same backwards as forwards. There’s a letter in the dead centre (“I”), like a fulcrum, on which everything else hinges. The great French virtuoso Georges Perec (his parents were Polish), came up with one in French (“Le grand palindrome”) over 10 pages long. Eccentric, certainly, possibly mad. But what if all human history is like this, and with every step forwards we are just as certainly going backwards? Welcome to paleo world.Perhaps the best recent example of palindromic history is the fall of the Berlin Wall – after which all those bricks were neatly recycled to build other walls, and people are still calling a halt to government with a view to building another one, bigger and better than the last. Even though it’s going to be hard to beat the Great Wall of China. Or even, in its more modest way, Hadrian’s Wall, all designed to keep the barbarians at bay. Which is ironic, because we are the barbarians, gorillas who can hold a pen or a phone. The more sophisticated, the more primal. The more advanced, the more primitive. Behold, homo americanus, a species newly depicted in anthropologist\u0026nbspEmmanuel Todd’s vast and mind-expanding Lineages of Modernity: A History of Humanity from the Stone Age to Homo Americanus, which posits that “It is the very primitiveness of America that has made it successful.”I was reminded, reading a recent biography of the French anthropologist\u0026nbspClaude Levi-Strauss, how beautifully humbling anthropology can be, rather like looking out on the Milky Way on a cold, clear night. You think you’re you. But in reality you’re not. You’re just part of a massive system of interlocking parts, stretching across time and space. The very idea of the self is a product of society, designed to keep everyone going about their business. But it’s a delusion that works, as Todd brilliantly argues. It’s one of the great paradoxes of human evolution: the more we convince ourselves we are autonomous iniduals, possessed of free will and integrity, the more we are exemplifying an ancient zeitgeist.Created with Sketch.The fall of the Berlin Wall – in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989If you’re starting to feel just a little bit weary of economics, then join the club. It’s one of the oddities of capitalism that, just as in Marxism, everything has to be seen in terms of economics or freakonomics. As the Bill Clinton campaign had it, it’s the economy, stupid! But what if, fundamentally and looking at it from an anthropological perspective, it’s nothing to do with the economy after all, stupid? Economics is only concerned with the conscious, even possibly rational part of human behaviour. But there is a collective unconscious too\u0026nbspthat we generally forget about, or would like to forget about: notably the family, or (to speak like an anthropologist) kinship relations.The present no longer exists: How our brains aren\u0027t past NeanderthalEveryone has one. To begin with, anyhow. Even if, as in the case of orphans, it may not last very long. But everybody gets orphaned\u0026nbspin the end. You lose your parents. Or maybe your parents kick you out. Or your parents split up. Maybe you lose touch with your siblings (if you ever had any in the first place). Maybe it’s Cain and Abel. Maybe your father takes you up a mountain to sacrifice you to Yahweh (thus Abraham and Isaac).I’m trying to remember if my parents ever actually said to me, “You’re on your own, now, sonny Jim,” or words to that effect, but it was definitely implied. I was confronted with the anguish of liberty early on. “You want to be a vegetarian? OK, let me see, I think we have some soya here somewhere.” Or “So you’re an atheist now. Interesting!” Or “That’s fine, you don’t have to be a solicitor.” And, “She seems nice.”Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The idea that there is ‘no such thing as society’ could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind itThe nuclear family, in other words, is about as close to anything-goes anarchy as it is possible to imagine within a rule-bound, semi-protective environment (“Remember to look before you cross the street”). It’s why we hate anyone to be “controlling”. The typical western-style family is, in essence, centrifugal, designed to shove you out into the world, producing adventurers and explorers and entrepreneurs and philosophers, prodding and probing and shaping reality. Rugged, dynamic, creative inidualists, with women given (in the best case) equivalent status to men. Rather like the early nomads that spread out to populate the earth, rather successfully, pausing only to exterminate Neanderthals along the way.Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The very idea that there is “no such thing as society” could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind it. And this sense of being doomed to wander lonely as a cloud is nothing new. It is – as Rousseau would say – “the state of nature”, our primal condition. Technological modernity coincides with our archaic origins. We are still savages, operating very much along the lines of hunter-gatherers, Bushmen of the Manhattan savanna, equipped with socks and shoes and a Twitter account. All the trappings of so-called civilisation are paper-thin. Strip away Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, and we would soon be picking up rocks and making spears and looking for a woolly mammoth to take down.The Flintstones never really went away. Which is why we now have paleo politics (what Todd calls “primordial democracy”) in the shape of Trump and Brexit. Or, as the existentialists put it so neatly, hell is other people. Some degree of xenophobia or plain old misanthropy is built into inidualism. Paranoia is a by-product of liberty. You’re on your own now, like the three pigs, but you have to beware of the big bad wolf. So build those walls strong and high.William Golding’s classic Lord of the Flies tells the tale of a bunch of polite British schoolboys who, left to their own devices on an island, are soon killing and slaughtering and worshipping idols. But it’s not fiction. I know a guy, Sam Fussell, who dropped out of Christ Church Oxford, where he was studying English poetry, got into bodybuilding, and eventually went primitive in the wilds of Montana where he shoots wolves and bears – sometimes with a bow and arrow. And the odd thing is, I really like this guy. He is my avatar. He taught me to shoot and has promised to save a bullet just for me for when the going gets too tough. Fussell is the closest real-life counterpart, in my experience, to the fictional figure of Jack Reacher, the XXL vigilante hero of Lee Child’s novels. They are both variations on homo americanus. Which is probably our biggest export to date, an exemplary product of the Anglosphere, and legitimate successor to 200,000-year old homo sapiens. Together with the second amendment of the American Constitution and regular urban massacres.But as T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, pointed out, humankind cannot bear very much reality. We get protective, especially where our young ones are concerned. And this is where a different kind of family set-up stems from. Emmanuel Todd, who is a demographer as well as anthropologist, hit me with an amazing statistic. In Iraq, 35 per cent\u0026nbspof married couples are first-cousins (he reckons that this figure can rise to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin Pakistan). He finds that across vast areas of Eurasia, a different kind of kinship system has developed which is patrilineal and communitarian, with fathers transmitting power and property to sons and keen to see close relatives marrying. This leads not just to women being disenfranchised and segregated, but to the subordination of the inidual, social stasis and clan wars.of married couples in Iraq are first-cousinsThe powerful point that he makes, contrary to conventional wisdom, is that the more repressive, controlling, non-nuclear, more centripetal and inward-looking (or “endogamous”) family is not “primitive”, although it may well be medieval. It is the nuclear (and “exogamous”) family that is more primitive, more caveman, more nomad. The cosy-cousins family is a much more recent invention and should, to his way of thinking be deconstructed. We need to go more primitive, not less.If we consider, for a moment, the current political landscape in the UK, you would have to describe it as increasingly exogamous. Nuclear in the best sense. There seems no compelling reason why, like all good families, parties should not split apart. Schisms are probably a good thing. Better to be disunited if you’re only going to unite around something utterly dumb and dismal.If economics is conscious behaviour, and education and religion are our subconscious, then it is still family relationships that form the deepest level of our unconscious life. Hence it is around inidualism that the clash (or at least ergence) of civilisations will occur. Todd sets out a table in which different societies are compared in terms of their core values under various headings to do with attitudes towards equality, feminism, endogamy and\u0026nbspauthority. The “anthropological distance” between the Anglosphere and Denmark (hello, Danes!) is zero. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the combined distance from Saudi Arabia is 7.5. I think we can assume, in the aftermath of Khashoggi, that the Saudis don’t exactly prioritise press freedom. Todd offers an equation which explains 911: “Maximum incomprehension + intimate association  hatred.” On the other hand, we shouldn’t be so Russophobic. We are closer to Russia (1.5 distance) than Germany (2.5).But however inidualist, we are never going to give up the sense of wanting to belong. We all need a club to support (mine, for example, is West Ham, although if there was an East Ham team I’d probably support them, having been born in East Ham Memorial Hospital). Similarly, we readily fall back on the idea of a nation. It’s what makes the World Cup competitions so irresistible. The more global, the more tribal. It’s pure palindromic history. Even hunter-gatherers had to band together to bring down a mammoth. Doing something about climate control could be a great opportunity for collective effort. Our problem is we have never yet discovered a form of solidarity that doesn’t automatically encode a desire to annihilate the competition. Or as Todd puts it:\u0026nbsp“Group cohesion depends on hostility to other groups ... Peace is a social problem.”iStock)Emmanuel Todd is an anglophile Frenchman who studied in Cambridge. He reveres the British empiricists and fondly cites AJ\u0026nbspAyer’s Language, Truth, and Logic as a way of cutting through the French over-preoccupation with words. He also credits The Beatles with doing more to undermine the Soviets than the CIA. He tends to think of the European Community as a doomed and deluded project, “a rigid and hierarchical system”. In an almost scientific way, extrapolating from existing data, he is willing to offer a few predictions about the way things are going. I like his theory of zombie religions: “Protestantism and Judaism are dead even though they think they are alive.” In the future we can expect to see more feminism and a greater indifference to gender. But also less (in certain parts of the world). Hence more polarisation.The bifurcation of the sexes took place only a few billion years ago. If palindromic history is anything to go by, and the future increasingly resembles the past, we can expect to see a time when the sexes and sex will fade away. Kids will pop up out of vats and get to select their parents for a change and tell them what beliefs to adopt. Or we give up the notion of reproducing altogether. Finally the bubble bursts, light is extinguished, and the whole shebang folds up and shrinks into a lonesome, colourblind, extremely dense particle and we are crushed into a singularity. Even though there is no more “we”. Only “one”. And then none.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers. Now, the shoes have lost one of their main features and cannot be controlled in the way they are intended.The problems have led to a raft of one star reviews on the Google Play Store, as customers complain the shoes are crashing.Created with Sketch.Best vegan shoes for women Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials? Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials?

Downloading and applying that caused the Android app to break.The shoes do have manual controls, meaning that people can lean down and tie them up. But a large part of the functionality is built around the fact\u0026nbspthey can be controlled through the companion app, allowing for easy tightening when needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure.

This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future.

The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television.

She revealed that she only discovered that her Beale Street director, Barry Jenkins, worked n the writers’ room during her time on the show.“I had no idea,” she said. “He says I actually met him, but I don’t remember.”Watchmen begins on HBO later this year.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would not be unfair to characterise them as dedicated Remainers pro-Europeans who have dedicated much of their political careers, in their respective former parties, to the European cause.Created with Sketch.

In this respect they share the instincts of many former colleagues in their old parties. In the words of Chris Leslie: “Choosing to stand by while our constituents’ lives and future opportunities are hurt by Brexit is a fundamental violation of Labour’s traditional values.”Debates about Brexit delay mean we’re missing the bigger pictureYet what might TIG do if a second referendum or a delay to Brexit – both it seems increasingly likely – was somehow not possible to achieve? Would they, when push comes to shove, back Theresa May’s deal over a no-deal Brexit – as logic would suggest? Or would they simply refuse to accept the choice as a genuine one and vote her deal down, if forced into such a dilemma? Might they have a free vote, each according to their own conscience?And if there was a Final Say referendum, what if Britain again voted to leave the EU? What then?More widely, in pursuit of their European beliefs, would TIG MPs be prepared to vote against the government in a vote of no confidence? The answer, as Heidi Allen told The Independent, is that they would not, because it might mean a government led by Jeremy Corbyn. But, on the other hand, that removes their negotiating leverage with Theresa May on Brexit she need not fear that they will eject her from Number 10.These sorts of questions, among many other tactical matters, is where differences of opinion will start to emerge – no doubt labelled “splits”. In future, particularly if they end up campaigning to re-enter the EU, TIG MPs will have more tense debates about having to adopt the euro, about the Schengen no-passport area, and about the UK’s contributions to the EU budget.Even so, the group’s 11 members have much more in common than points of difference, such as their enthusiasm for Europe. There is a reason, for example, why Ian Austin, an MP for Dudley, did not choose to join them when he defected from Labour – because he is prepared to support a version of Brexit and TIG is not.If and when the time comes for a general election, if the Brexit issue is still live, TIG will, with the Liberal Democrats, the nationalists in Scotland and Wales, the Greens and the Northern Irish republican parties, offer an unequivocally anti-Brexit, pro-second referendum, pro-Remain agenda.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Trawsgoed in Ceredigion, west Wales, beating the previous record of 19.7C\u0026nbspin Greenwich in 1998.Mr Burkill said the conditions were the result of warm air combining with a period of sunshine across the UK.Winds from the south and south-east, including from Spain and Africa, are pushing air over a part of Wales that has the greatest land track, causing it to get gradually warmer, he said.The further the air travels over higher ground, the more moisture it loses and faster it heats up.Cooler conditions will arrive on Wednesday, with fog expected in the morning across England and Wales.\u0026nbspThe fog could cause disruption at roads and airports, Mr Burkill said.\u0026nbspIt will be a cloudier day than we\u0027ve seen of late, with temperatures, on average, hitting 15C\u0026nbspor 16C. That is still warmer than average for the time of year.\u0026nbspThe weather will become\u0026nbspless mild and more unsettled from Thursday, with some heavy showers possible.\u0026nbspTemperatures are likely to drop to 13C or 14C\u0026nbspby the end of the week.Additional reporting by agencies\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

What I do know is you have got elected politicians on your programme, you had Emily Thornberry out last night, setting out what the position is we agreed as the Labour Party.Asked about a potential Labour revolt over a referendum, Sir Keir acknowledged: I\u0027m well aware of different views across my own party and across Parliament on pretty well all Brexit issues.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates throughout the day.We’ll tell you what’s true.

slapped down Jeremy Corbyn’s aides as he vowed Labour would back moves to give voters the chance to reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal in a fresh referendum.The Labour leader’s advisers are accused of watering down the party’s surprise commitment to a referendum – suggesting it would not cover putting the prime minister’s agreement on the ballot paper.But Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisted “elected politicians” had decided the policy, with Mr Corbyn’s agreement, saying: “If Theresa May’s deal goes through, it is subject to the lock of a public vote.”The cracks emerged within hours of the announcement, which has been hailed as potentially “a defining moment” in the campaign for a Final Say referendum on the Brexit outcome.Mr Corbyn – desperate to head off further defections to the breakaway Independent Group – said he would back another public vote if, as expected, his own softer withdrawal plan is defeated this week.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote:

briefing note for MPs said an amendment “could be attached to the prime minister’s deal – or a version of it – should it win a majority in the House of Commons”.The sentence was a reference to the amendment put forward by Labour backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, for a confirmatory referendum.However, on Monday night, a Labour source said the party would not support the amendment in its current form, because “we will not be voting for anything which supports May’s damaging Brexit deal”.A second, anonymous sources briefed that Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, “misspoke” when she said the referendum was likely to be Ms May’s deal vs Remain.Asked if Mr Corbyn’s aides were attempting to dilute the pledge, Sir Keir said: “You have got elected politicians on your programme – you had Emily Thornberry out last night – setting out what the position is that we agreed as the Labour party.“What I am saying is telling you what was in the written briefing, the official briefing from my office and Jeremy’s office, to Labour MPs last night“There is no question about that – it should be between a credible Leave option and Remain.”Three ministers urge May to take no-deal Brexit off the tableMajor boost for fresh Brexit referendum as Corbyn gives backingBrexit delay a step closer as rebels and EU leaders pile on pressureSir Keir made clear that a “credible Leave option” meant Ms May’s deal, if approved – although it is still unclear if Labour will abstain to allow it to pass, subject to a referendum.It appeared Mr Corbyn’s aides were suggesting Labour would only back a referendum on its own Brexit proposals, which are almost certain to be rejected by MPs.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Sir Keir also sought to play down suggestions that at least 25 Labour MPs would refuse to back a second referendum in a Commons vote.He pointed out that predictions of a similar revolt on the “meaningful vote” had been proved wrong, after a call for unity, adding: “That pretty well worked.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Labour confirmed Remain would be on the ballot paper – but said it would not countenance\u0026nbspan option of a no-deal Brexit.Furthermore, the fear of another referendum may yet persuade Tory opponents of the deal to finally back it when the second “meaningful vote” takes place, probably on 12 March.Nevertheless, Peter Kyle,the\u0026nbspLabour MP who has proposed backing Theresa May’s deal subject to a referendum, said: “There\u0027s no going back on this now for Jeremy or the party.”No-deal Brexit an \u0027unforgivable act of self-harm\u0027 say UK insurersWhat is the Independent Group’s position on Brexit?Brexit ‘could trigger surge in animal testing’ as EU rules invalidatedAnother Tory signals she could leave her party over BrexitMr Smith said the referendum was a prize\u0026nbspworth grabbing for the Commons approving the stalled agreement.\u0026nbsp“It is the right thing to do for the country and for Labour voters,” he said.Clive Lewis, a shadow minister who warned support for Brexit would keep Mr Corbyn pout of power, said: “This decision is a hugely positive step for the Labour party and our movement as a whole.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said it could be a defining moment. We have long argued it is the right and logical thing to give the public the final say,” he said.The announcement came shortly before Mr Corbyn addressed the weekly meeting of Labour MPs, at which he was certain to face strong criticism about his confused stance on Brexit.At first, it was unclear whether Mr Corbyn was pledging to back a referendum on the prime minister’s deal, or only in the unlikely event of Labour’s own Brexit proposals being adopted.However, a briefing note for Labour MPs stated: “If our frontbench amendment does not win the support of the Commons this week, we will put forward or support an amendment in favour of a public vote.”Such an amendment “could be attached to the prime minister’s deal – or a version of it – should it win a majority in the House of Commons”.The sentence was a reference to the amendment put forward by Mr Kyle, and fellow backbencher Phil Wilson, for a confirmatory referendum.However, a Labour source said the party would not support the amendment in its current form, because “we will not be voting for anything which supports May\u0027s damaging Brexit deal”.It was unclear what changes the leadership would demand. Mr Kyle and Mr Wilson have argued that Labour MPs would not need to vote with the Conservatives, but merely abstain.The announcement drew some fierce criticism in the parliamentary Labour party meeting, the pro-Brexit John Mann telling Mr Corbyn: “In the Midlands and north of England this decision today will stop you from being prime minister. The price will be paid.”Earlier, speaking in Egypt, Theresa May suggested she could try to force her agreement through parliament before it had\u0026nbspbeen formally approved by the other 27 member states.Rejecting calls for a delay to Brexit, she said: An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn\u0027t deliver a decision in parliament, it doesn\u0027t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word \u0027delay\u0027 says.”Ms May will make a statement to MPs on Tuesday, before the next round of Brexit votes – including on the cross-party bid to force an Article 50 extension if the deal is blocked again – on Wednesday.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.“Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.”Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.“It’s within our grasp to leave with a deal on March 29 and that’s where all of my energies are going to be focused,” she said.Challenged over whether MPs would be able to vote on any additional assurances she secured\u0026nbspfrom Brussels before they had been formally signed off by the EU27, Mrs May told reporters: “It is possible to do it either way.”Rejecting calls for a delay, the prime minister said: “An extension to Article 50, a delay in this process, doesn’t deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesn’t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word ‘delay’ says.“Any extension of Article 50 isn’t addressing the issues.

Women protesting the forced wearing of the hijab were amongst those targeted by authorities.The country witnessed two major nationwide protests in January and then in JulyAugust, with security forces targeting those demonstrating with live ammunition, tear gas and water cannon, according to the group.The European Union however, which has an ongoing human rights dialogue with the Tehran, “was muted” in its response.Where are the remains of Khashoggi\u0027s predecessor?Egypt\u0027s Sisi denies his country holds any political prisoners UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia causing ‘significant’ civilian deathsIn Egypt, authorities continued to crack down on opposition, intensifying efforts in the run-up to the presidential elections in March 2018, which saw dozens of people arrested.Egypt is now a more dangerous place for critics than at any other time in the country’s recent history,\u0026nbspthe group found.“The authorities used solitary confinement that amounted to torture and other ill-treatment and enforced disappearance against hundreds of people with impunity,” Amnesty International said.Rights groups strongly criticised Egypt this month for executing nine men accused of the 2015 killing of the country\u0027s chief prosecutor, citing concerns of unfair trials with confessions extracted under torture.\u0026nbspOn Monday,\u0026nbspEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi defended the death penalty during a summit between Arab and European states, saying the two regions had two different cultures.coverup’ in Khashoggi killing during speaking tourThe priority in Europe is achieving and maintaining wellbeing for its people.

but MPs rejected it in January.Theresa May headed to Brussels on February  with fresh plans to fix the hated Irish border backstop.Eurocrats have privately hinted they are open to tweaking the wording to reassure MPs and help get a deal passed.If Parliament cannot support a deal - and there is no extension - the UK will leave the EU without a deal on March .That would mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisation rules, experts say.Some Brexiteers say that could be positive - opening up trade with the rest of the world - but many people fear chaos.On January , Boris Johnson said that a No Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No Deal Brexit is likely,  per cent think a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent said the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Theresa May has a Withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated with Brussels.But MPs rejected it when it was voted on in parliament in January.Mrs May suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat of any British prime minister when the Withdrawal agreement was rejected by a majority of .She announced another vote will be held by March  - just over two weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union.Negotiations are still continuing over the hated Irish backstop which aims to prevent a hard boarder in Northern Ireland.Parliament have voted that she must seek alternative arrangements to prevent a hard boarder.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Businesses will receive a -page document, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government over the next few days.The news comes as:Theresa May’s Government plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.In December , Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.As bitter Brexit battles rage on:Businesses received a -page document about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government.The papers show:The decision will mean putting off Britain’s EU exit by weeks or months  MPs still haven’t passed a new orce agreement in two weeks time.On Monday night, three Remain Ministers warned as many as  could quitshe fails to commit to delaying Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000295225347.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"car wash slaves","story":"If youve paid less than £, chances are they are a slave.Victims are threatened with violence against their families, have their passports stolen so they cant leave, and are crammed into rat-infested housing.Forced to work with toxic chemicals and no protective clothing, medics report cases where car wash slaves have found their shoes fused to their skin for weeks.Nor are these isolated incidents - there are , unregulated car wash sites, and  per cent of slave labour cases in  involved car wash workers.As part of the Suns Stamp Out Slavery campaign in conjunction with the Co Op, which proposes to extend support given to rescued slaves from  days to one year, we investigate the horrying truth behind cheap car washes.Joe, in his early twenties, travelled by coach from Poland to the UK after being promised building work in  - but when he arrived he was forced to work -hour days for free in a car wash and his gang master stole his passport so he couldnt leave.He and the other men working there were forbidden from taking lunch breaks or eating during their shts - and working in the cold and wet for so many hours left them sick.They were threatened with violence and given no rest - the men were forced to live in a tiny room in a flat, with no heating or beds to sleep in - and they were fed scraps by their captors, who patrolled their digs at night.He says: “Whenever I complained about how badly I was being treated I was threatened with homelessness and violence towards me and my family.They claimed that they knew my family’s home address back in Poland and that they would go and hurt themI didnt do what I was told. They also showed me a box of weapons that they said they would use on anyone who went against them.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days government support after being recognised as a victim. Campaigners and businesses say this is not enough time for victims to find a place to live and means to support themselves so they risk becoming homeless and destitute.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a year to recover, and alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial support and other services.Fearing for his le, Joe eventually fled with nothing but the clothes he was wearing, and was referred to The Salvation Army who helped him find a safe house, where he is currently living. But sadly, like many victims of modern day slavery, Joe was so scared of his traffickers that he didn’t want to speak to the police so there was no investigation into his case.When labourer Sandu Laurentiu-Sava first arrived in the UK and landed a job in a car wash, he believed it was the perfect opportunity hed been looking for to earn enough money to provide for his family back home in Romania.However, the horric reality that greeted him was very dferent.When he arrived in the UK, he was forced to work long days at Bubbles Car Wash in Bethnal Green, East London, and kept in a squalid, rat-infested flat owned by his employer that he shared with five other workers.One summer evening in August  after a long sht Sandu, , was electrocuted and killed while taking a shower.Car wash owner Shaip Nimani, then , was jailed for four years after admitting manslaughter.Workers without rubber gloves have suffered burns from putting their bare hands into water tainted with chemicals, and a lack of protective footwear has also led to trench foot - a painful condition of the feet caused by long immersion in cold water.  Salvation Army medic Anne Read attended a police raid to provide support to potential victims last year and was horried by what she saw.She says: “We were offering them food and drink and the chance for a shower and a change of clothes while victims were being interviewed.“Whilst other men gratefully took the new clothes offered, one of them seemed reluctant to remove his shoes. When we askedhe was OK, he showed us his feet. He had been wearing just his own lightweight shoes to work on the car wash. Over time the harsh chemicals in the cleaning fluids he had been forced to use had fused his shoes onto his feet, which meant that he hadn’t been able to remove them for weeks.The shoes had to be surgically removed. This is just one of many stories of the unspeakable cruelty people face at the hands of their trafficker which we see everyday as victims of modern slavery come to us for support.Despite being promised work and accommodation by gang members posing as recruiters, sadly for the large number of car wash labourers trafficked to the UK, the pay and living conditions are diabolical.Hand car washing has grown largely unchecked for the past  to  years, car wash expert Dawn Frazer says.In November last year police raided a premises in Manchester and three men were detained. Police said ten ‘potential victims’ of slavery were rescued following the sting on Drive and Shine car wash.In  Kristian Holub admitted forcing Czech immigrant Milan Tencik - who was made to sleep on the floor - to work in a car wash, and business owner Ali Mohammed Raza was jailed for six years in  for trafficking five Syrian illegal immigrants to Hull to clean vehicles. In the same year brothers Igor and Marek Marcin got  months and  months’ jail time for trafficking  Czech and Slovak men to work in car washes and factories, paying them just £ a week and putting them up in bug-infested rooms.Heartbreaking stories like these are why The Sun is backing calls for a change in the law so that specialist support given to modern slavery victims – including forced labour and human trafficking – is increased from as little as  days to a full year, as they rebuild their lives.You can sign the petition for the Modern Slavery Victim Support Bill here.Find out more about Co-Ops Bright Future programme, which offers employment to survivors of modern slavery, here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470565142.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"defected tory mps tory far right claims","story":"So forget their paranoid and baseless ­fantasies about Ukip infiltrators. Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity. The Tories’ recruitment shts the entire focus.Their anti-Brexit arguments, though, are the same old Remoaner claptrap.Soubry even trotted out the feeblest of all, counting non-voters to claim  per cent of us did not back Brexit: A child’s logic, applying to every election ever.Allen claimed they heard the “clarion call for change” from .million Leave voters. They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations. The fact this is the brainchild of Oliver “Poll Tax” Letwin should tell you what chaos it will unleash.Which is doubtless why the EU is going cold on compromising. Why should it,Remainers will postpone Brexit Tory Leave MPs must not assume this will fail. Brexit is in mortal danger.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat. They are turning into exactly the type of people they once condemned.The time has come to call a halt to their complacency and self-satisfaction. Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is claimed that Ibbotson didnt do this.The report states Mr Ibbotson arrived in Nantes two days before the flight on January .Mr Ibbotson, , had written he was a bit rusty with the ILSon Facebook after arriving at the airport.He later wrote: Was not tobad when I got there but Im a bit rusty with the ils, in France now.A friend replied: Rusty with the ILS !

The Peterborough MP was driven at speed out of HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey, this morning after spending a month of her three-month jail term locked up.She has refused to quit Parliament despite being jailed for perverting the course of justice and expelled by Labour .The MP - who was tipped as a rising star, and allies claimed saw herself as a future leader - was jailed for lying to avoid a speeding charge. She is appealing her conviction. Onasanya, , sat in the back of a white Sodexo-branded Vauxhall with the closest window to her covered by a hi-vis jacket as it drove past photographers this morning.  During the time she spent in jail the former solicitor refused to stand down - which meant Parliament was forced to pay her around pound, of her pound,-a-year MPs salary. Meanwhile her lower-paid staff were forced to run her office in Peterborough without her.Yet the MP insisted she was innocent, comparing herself to Jesus and Moses in a leaked messaged to MPs when she was convicted in December.She wrote: I am in good Biblical company along with Joseph, Moses, Daniel and his three Hebrew friends who were each found guilty by the courts of their day.Now the Independent MP could become the first to vote in the House of Commons wearing an electronic tag, as the Mirror revealed earlier this month. Under Parliamentary rules, Onasanya had to receive a jail sentence of at least  months to be automatically removed as an MP. However,she loses her appeal - for which a date isnt yet set - she could be removed from Parliament through a recall petition. Under this mechanism, she would face a by-electiona petition is signed by more than % of the electorate in the constituency. Labour is understood to be mounting preparations for a by-election.  Protesters outside her office earlier this month declared her a liar. Onasanya was jailed for three months at the Old Bailey on January  after being convicted of perverting the course of justice by lying to avoid a speeding charge. The MP with a once-promising career is continuing in her role, sitting as an Independent politician despite calls for her resignation.  Onasanya, a solicitor by profession, is expected to have to obey strict conditions as part of her early release. It came after the Attorney Generals Office ruled that her sentence was not unduly lenient following a complaint being lodged. Jurors at the Old Bailey were told that Onasanya colluded with her brother Festus after her car was clocked speeding at mph in a mph zone in the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, in July . She was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the guilty driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of her brother, who was away visiting his parents in Russia. Festus Onasanya was sentenced to  months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice over speeding, including over the July  incident.

The major announcement comes after months of pressure from Remain MPs and Labours membership to back a public vote. But despite Labours support, it doesn’t mean that a second vote will definitely happen. Exactly how and when Labour will back a second EU referendum is still not clear. And more importantly, the numbers in Parliament are still not there. Around two dozen Labour MPs are thought to be against the plan, worrying that it would be too isive for the country.  And only a handful of Tories back a People’s Vote, so even with the support of the SNP and the Lib Dems, it remains unlikely to pass. That does not mean Corbyn’s move was futile. But heres an explanation of what has happened - and what might happen next.  For the first time, Labour has announced plans for the party to vote in favour of a second EU referendum. Speaking to MPs last night, Jeremy Corbyn confirmed he will put forward or support an amendment in Parliament in favour of a so-called Peoples Vote. It is still unclear exactly what form the partys backing for a second referendum would take, whether it would be legally binding, and what conditions could be put on it. A prominent Labour MP said it will only happen next month, when MPs vote on Theresa Mays final Brexit deal. But Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said Remain would be an option on the ballot paper - and Labour would campaign for Remaina referendum is held. Its being seen as a major step forward by Remainers in the party after months of lobbying the leadership - which previously only had a public vote as an option on the table. It also comes a week after eight MPs defected to the new Independent Group over Mr Corbyns failure to stop Brexit.  Some allies of the Labour leader have tried to suggest nothing has changed. This is incorrect. The development was even called an announcement in an official briefing to Labours own MPs. What allies say is that Labour HAS backed calls for a second referendum since the party conference in October. That is technically correct, but the party conference committed to keep a second referendum as one option on the table among many. Other options have now been exhausted, and MPs have been pushing a reluctant Jeremy Corbyn to swing his full weight behind a second referendum. Now, finally, hes taken a jump in that direction that couldactually make it happen. So both sides are right. It is in line with the conference policy - AND it is a change to Labours position. Would Remain be an option on the ballot paper   Yes,you believe Shadow Cabinet ministers Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer. Speaking on Channel  News Emily Thornberry confirmed that Labour would campaign to Remain in a second Brexit referendum The shadow foreign secretary said: If its a choice between that and a disastrous Tory Brexit , we will be campaigning to remain, because thats all we can do. And Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said a second referendum should be a basic choice between a credible Leave option and Remain. This suggests it could be a choice between Remain and Theresa Mays deal, a prospect heavily rejected by others in Labour.   Is Labour % backing a public vote then  No.  First of all, Labour will only back a pro-public vote amendmentLabours own plan for Brexit is voted down this week. Jeremy Corbyn is tabling a House of Commons amendment containing his plan , which would allow MPs to back it. However, its widely expected to fail in a vote on Wednesday night, so the move to a second referendum is pretty inevitable. Secondly, the conditions and timing and legally enforcable nature of Labours bid still arent known. Labour is still working with the MP Peter Kyle on an amendment that would back Theresa Mays deal, on the condition it then goes to a public referendum for approval. Mr Kyles amendment was due to happen on Wednesday night but thats too soon for Jeremy Corbyn. What is Labours own Brexit plan   Before backing a second EU referendum, Labours own credible alternative plan must be defeated by MPs first on Wednesday night. This essentially involves forcing the government to stick to Labours five red lines:A permanent and comprehensive customs union with the EU Close alignment with the Single Market underpinned by shared institutions and obligations Dynamic alignment on rights and protections Commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, including in areas such as the environment, education, and industrial regulation and Unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases.This plan is nothing new - Labours been publicly proposing it for weeks. Jeremy Corbyn took it into talks with Theresa May but she rejected it because a customs union would stop the UK striking trade deals around the world. Is Labour united behind the move   As MPs in the crowded Westminster room last night testied, the parliamentary party was more united than it has been for months. All the expectations were that the Labour leader would face a barracking over his handling of anti-semitism and flack for centrist MPs quitting the party. But by pulling the second referendum rabbit out of the hat, he looks likely to have staved off more defections for now. He has also given his increasingly mutinous core supporters - many of them young and enthusiastic Remainers - renewed faith. Tottenham MP David Lammy added: “ Jeremy Corbyn is today taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time.”  John Mann is understood to have told MPs that people in the north of England “will never vote labour again”. The Bassetlaw MP added: “the price will be paid”. “If there is not a free vote, without that, you will not be prime minister because you will lose votes in the midlands and in the north”. Stephen Kinnock gave the move a cautious welcome, saying: I’m pleased that parliament will have an opportunity, finally, to express its view on this. I still have deep reservations about the idea of having another referendum. I think it would be deeply isive. While some Labour MPs in Leave seats argue that backing a second referendum will be electoral suicide, that is unlikely to ever be properly tested. There is always the danger that the move could unite the Conservative party and help get the PM’s deal over the line. But there are some who believe that the Labour leader wouldn’t be too unhappy to see Brexit happen.  Brexiteers outside Labour have accused the party of betraying its supporters who voted Leave. Ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: Five million people who voted for Brexit then voted for Jeremy Corbyn the following year. For them, this is a disaster. The North London Labour party will be happy, they will be celebrating but they are out of touch with the country outside the M. Will a second referendum actually happen  It seems unlikely. Corbyn’s team know that while the move is a gamble, he is likely to end up on the right side of Labour Party history. It is probably too late for his backing for a People’s Vote to actually help deliver one. But the leadership will always be able to claim that, in the end, he came round. A second referendum was always supposed to be the final option on the table. With party heavyweights including Keir Starmer, Tom Watson and Emily Thornberry behind it - it also became one he could not longer resist."},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham pub bombing families demand","story":"NewsBirmingham pub bombing: Families demand the truth  years after blast killed A minutes silence has been held as an inquest opens into explosions at two busy pubs which ripped apart familiesShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  FEB NewsJulie Hambleton , whose sister Maxine died, walks with Michelle Sealey , whose father Paul Davies was also among those killed\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThose who lost loved ones in Birmingham’s  pub bombings say they hope “the truth” will finally emerge as the inquests into the  who died resumed.

Writing in the Daily Mail, they warned against being swept over the precipice on March , and said: It is a commitment that would be greeted with relief by the vast majority of MPs, businesses and their employees. We implore the Government to take that step this week. Butthe Prime Minister is not able to make this commitment, we will have no choice other than to join MPs of all parties in the House of Commons, including fellow ministers, in acting in the national interest to prevent a disaster in less than five weeks time that we may regret forever.   The paper also claimed  ministers would be ready to resign to stop no deal. It came after Mrs May suggested she could try to take her EU Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament before it has been formally approved by the other  member states. Amid growing pressure to delay Brexit with just  days left on the clock, the Prime Minister insisted it is within our grasp for Britain to leave the EU with a deal on March . European Council president Donald Tusk revealed that he had discussed the legal and procedural process for extending the two-year Article  withdrawal negotiations with Mrs May when he met her on Sunday in Egypt.   Mr Tusk said delaying the UKs withdrawal beyond March  is now a rational solution, warning that the only alternative,MPs cannot agree a deal, is a chaotic Brexit. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to wake up. Mr Rutte told the BBC: The Netherlands is one of your best friends. What you guys are doing - leaving EU in this time of insecurity in the world, instability in EU - is the wrong decision. Its four weeks until the end date and still the UK has not agreed a position. So, now we are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. Its unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you. Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal. Despite also facing pressure from pro-Europe Tories for a delay, the Prime Minister insisted in a press conference at the end of a summit of EU and Arab nations that she was sticking to her timetable.  Its within our grasp to leave with a deal on March  and thats where all of my energies are going to be focused, she said. Challenged over whether MPs would be able to vote on any additional assurances she secures from Brussels before they have been formally signed off by the EU, Mrs May told reporters: It is possible to do it either way. Rejecting calls for a delay, the Prime Minister said: An extension to Article , a delay in this process, doesnt deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesnt deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word delay says. Any extension of Article  isnt addressing the issues. We have it within our grasp. Ive had a real sense from the meetings Ive had here and the conversations Ive had in recent days that we can achieve that deal. Mr Tusk said it was absolutely clear thatthere was no majority in the Commons to approve a deal, Britain faces chaotic Brexit or extension. The less time there is until March , the greater the likelihood of an extension, said Mr Tusk. This is an objective fact. Not our intention, not our plan, but an objective fact. I believe that, in the situation we are in, an extension would be a rational solution, but Prime Minister May still believes she is able to avoid this scenario.  Mrs May said she had good meetings in Egypt with Mr Tusk, Mr Rutte, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish premier Leo Varadkar and Italys Giuseppe Conte. What I sense in all my conversations with my fellow leaders, both here in Sharm El-Sheikh and in recent days, is a real determination to find a way through which allows the UK to leave the EU in a smooth and orderly way with a deal, she said. The meetings came after the PM admitted she will not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a meaningful vote this week. She said she will put her deal to Parliament by March  at the latest -  days before Britain is due to leave the EU. The PM faces the prospect of another potentially damaging Commons revolt on Wednesday, when MPs are expected to mount a fresh attempt to block a no-deal break and extend Article . A cross-party group of MPs immediately confirmed they will table an amendment giving the House the power to demand a delay to Brexitan agreement is not in place by March .  In recent days three pro-EU Cabinet ministers - Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark - signalled they could be prepared to back the amendmentthere is no breakthrough in negotiations. There was speculation that up to  Tory MPs - including as many as  ministers - could be prepared to join them as patience among MPs opposed to no deal is stretched to breaking point. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who drew up the amendment with Conservative former minister Sir Oliver Letwin, said it would become the real meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. She told BBC Radio s Today programme: The Government doesnt feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment - the idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still dont know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and were not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline. I dont see how businesses can plan, I dont see how public services can plan, and I think its just deeply damaging. Mrs May confirmed that Brexit negotiators willto Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with the EUs Michel Barnier.

But realising he couldn’t swim, Swinfield then begged a police officer to pull him from the water. The officer in question was holding Swinfields baby at the time, having removed the child from the upturned vehicle.   Jailing him for  months, Recorder Simon King said: “This was as dangerous as it is possible to get without it resulting in death or serious injury not only to your partner and son but to other road users. “The horrible irony is that the two people who suffered the most serious injuries, although thankfully they were not too serious, were your partner and young son who you left abandoned in the car which you flipped. “The maximum sentence I can give you is two years and I am obliged to give you % credit for your guilty plea.   “Be assured thatthere was a more serious punishment available to me I would have no hesitation to handing it to you.” Sarah Slater, prosecuting, played CCTV footage of part of the chase to the court.

Swinfield then speeds down Lansdown Grove, Florence Avenue, Norfolk Road, back on the Nottingham Road, Market Place and finally on to Tamworth Road where he collides with the final vehicle and ends up on the roof.

He was arrested, charged and pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, failing to stop following an accident and to driving without insurance or a valid licence. The incident happened at .pm on Saturday, January , involved a Vauxhall Corsa and closed part of Tamworth Road, in Long Eaton. The partner and child were taken to the Queens Medical Centre following the crash which saw them both receive black eyes and bruising. Christopher Brewin, for Swinfield, said: “He does appreciate how serious this is and he’s ashamed of his conduct.” As well as the jail term, Recorder King handed Swinfield a two-year driving ban.

The mercury topped C in several parts of the country on Monday - the warmest winter day since records began.

The previous winter record was .C at Greenwich, east London, in . Last night Met Office meteorologist Luke Miall said today could be just as warm.   We could well again see similar values, he said. Whether it will be record-breaking again, were not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close. The day will likely start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about  or  degrees. North-west Wales and London are most likely to feel the highest temperatures. The warmth follows last Februarys Beast from the East, which plunged temperatures below freezing and brought heavy snowfall across the country.  Cooler temperatures expected from Wednesday onwards will be still above average for February, Mr Miall said. Heavy showers are possible on Thursday as temperatures struggle to get above C or C. Friday, March , will mark the first day of meteorological spring and is expected to be mostly dry before a wet weekend. Mr Miall added: The weekend doesnt look great, its looking wet and windy across the country. Theres lots of uncertainty over the details because its still a long way off but wet and windy seems to be the theme through many areas.

The fight, captured on CCTV , saw fists flying before a white van driver intervened and separated them outside the east Hull shop.The violent duo were captured smacking each other and landing punches to each other’s faces in the scuffle which lasted almost  seconds. The owner of the shop, which captured the footage on its CCTV camera, was left appalled and he believes two “expelled students” were responsible.The man, who does not want to be named, told Hull Live : “These naughty boys come twice a week and that incident was to do with them lads.  “They’ve come in before and been cheeky in the shop and I’ve had to say to them that I’m not having any of this. The guy came in and bought a J and I think he tried to smash it over this kid. “These are youngsters who clearly don’t understand discipline. They have got all their lives in front of them and they need to respect each other. The footage, which was recorded on February  around .am, shows a teenager in a grey tracksuit loitering outside the shop when another teen and woman appear exiting the store. The departing teenager appears to throw a punch towards the other boy waiting outside the shop before the pair begin to violently swing at each other with the woman, who was wearing a pink jacket, trying to split them up. One of them falls to the floor with the other brutally hitting him as he lies on the ground.   More passers-by then appear to try and break up the fight but the pair then begin smacking each other with one man’s trousers starting to fall down during the scuffle. The two of them eventually break away from each other and move to the pavement outside the shop before one starts savagely beating up the other with people standing and watching the commotion unfold. A white van driver eventually pulls up with two men rushing out of the vehicle to break up the fight. The van then leaves and the fighting pair go their separate ways with one man seen pulling off his top so friends can seemingly inspect his injuries. “I don’t think anyone suffered any serious injuries but you just don’t expect that kind of behaviour on the street,” the shopkeeper said. “I’m just glad the white van man who was passing by got there when he did to stop it. Massive thanks must go to him.”   The shopkeeper believes the youngsters involved in the fight have been expelled from schools in the area and he is amazed neither of the pair suffered le changing injuries due to the brutality of the punches thrown at one another. “I’m just worried because these youngsters could have been really badly injured and they could have suffered injuries which would have damaged them for le, he added. “That glass bottle could have really hurt somebody and that is a weapon. It’s just a shame to think people are going around fighting each other and I think youngsters nowadays need to be disciplined. Street fighting seems to be on the increase in Hull and I’m not sure what is going on.

The number of young women taking on roles as sugar babies in Cambridge is on the rise and some are reportedly making more than pound, per month. And a -year-old says taking up the role is easier than one might think. There are several companies which operate around the country, such as Seeking Arrangements, which enable users to meet a Sugar Daddy or Momma.According to the SA website, millions of students are taking on these roles as an innovative way to pay off their student loans. Nearly  students from the University of Cambridge are signed up to SA making it the th most popular destination for sugar baby activities in the country.The site has around  new signings each year from Cambridge University.Cambridgeshire Live spoke to a local sugar baby , , to find out what exactly goes on behind closed doors. What made you do it and is it for everyone I heard about the site through friends but it wasn’t until I read an article online about how this girl quit and actually married her Sugar Daddy that I decided to try it. You just have to be someone who is comfortable being upfront about what you are looking for in your next relationship. I was a student when I began using the site. I chose to date a higher class of man to help me supplement my living costs, yes.How much money do you make The men that I meet are not customers. I don’t think that’s allowed. We actually date! If I do receive financial or physical gts, the amount ies. I’d saythey are helping me with my bills, I’m gted about pound, per month. In total I’ve probably been gted about pound, since finding my most recent Sugar Daddy.Aside from the money are there any other perks of the job In terms of seeking, the best part is having access to people all over the world and I have met a few really cool people. I’m a major foodie so I love to go out to lunch or dinner. I have travelled a little bit throughout the country and to a few other big cities. Sometimes we go to concert events or Broadway shows.  You read all sorts about sugar babies getting designer handbags and Chanel No. - but whats the most expensive gt youve ever received The most expensive place that I’ve been was to Paris for four days last year. The most expensive gts that I’ve received have been a Rolex and a few designer shoes, a few Jimmy Choos, Louboutins and Louis Vuitton bags.Yeah sure, we all have Louboutins knocking around the house! But it cant be all designer gts and romantic getaways. Do you ever get scared something might happen to you The worst part is that there are some people on there with the wrong intentions or pretend to be someone they are not. It’s just like other dating sites that I’ve tried. I wasn’t so much scared because I know the cautionary steps of meeting someone for the first time, but I was certainly a little nervous to find out what he was looking for and how he’d approach this style of dating. As long as I am smart and cautious about who I meet, it’s no dferent than dating before. I do use a dferent name and number until I meet with the right match. I do this because it adds a sense of safety andthey somehow tried to expose my personal information online, it’d be harder to trace.Do you think of it as your real job The biggest misconception about sugar babies, is that people think we are lazy and don’t want to be more than a Sugar Baby. I have a job, I work part-time as a customer service representative and that’s my job. I have dreams, and goals that I want to achieve.Right, lets address the elephant in the room, do you have sex with your Sugar Daddies and do they have any weird fetishes I don’t have customers, just Sugar Daddies. If I feel like it’s grown to a point where I trust this person and see him in my le, why not. It’s no dferent than having a boyfriend of the same age, who is rich and can splurge on fancy dinners or gts. I have yet to meet one with a fetish but my friend has met a few with some interesting requests.Such as That would be telling...How often do you see each other I see my partners maybe two or three times a week. I prefer to date one person at a time. I also chat with my past Sugar Daddies all the time. They have been great influences in my le.Is there a lot of competition I thought that sales reps were in high demand but sugar babies are pretty sought after in the UK too.Do you ever find out much about what your *coughs* daddy does for a living I’ve met a few business executives, doctors, and sales directors.

She has also undergone liposuction on the stomach, inner and outer thighs, a bum lt, fillers under the eyes, jawline filler and Botox. And after having all the procedures, the attorney says she now feels like a real princess. “When I look in the mirror, I’m happy again. I still see me, but a better version of me, she said.   Xochytl started her quest for perfection after giving birth to daughter Isla nearly two years ago. She felt self-conscious over how her clothes fitted and felt that no matter how much make-up she put on or how she dressed, she would ‘never be presentable’. It was then that she started admiring the beauty and regal class of Duchess of Sussex and became determined to look more like the royal figure. She said: “I really like her, I have always thought she was a classy person, she’s very relatable and I think she’s absolutely beautul.  “Beauty wise I thought she was a gorgeous, then on a personal level through getting to know her a little more I guess it did enhance my admiration for her. “Knowing the things she went through, that she didn’t grow up with the perfect le and with family struggles made her even more relatable.” And the mum has even noticed Isla,  months, now shouts ‘mommy, mommy’ whenever seeing pictures of Meghan. Xochytl added: “I’m at the point where I feel I can put myself out there in the world again.  “Previously I felt no matter how much make-up I put on or how I fixed my hair that I wasn’t properly presentable. “I had very big self-confidence issues, but now I feel I can put on a nice dress and don’t need to wear much make-up because I feel great. “I still wear the same sized clothing but they fit perfectly now, I don’t have big long rolls hanging out of my pants anymore. “I don’t think I look identical to Meghan Markle, but I do see our similarities a lot more now, my nose definitely resembles hers more closely.  She continued: “I also had fillers in my jawline to have a stronger jaw like she does, so I do feel I more strongly resemble her now. “I got out of it what I wanted and I see more of a resemblance to her, whenever my -month-old sees Meghan she looks at her and says ‘Mommy, mommy’. “When it happened I just kind of laughing, but it also makes me feel good, like ‘Ok, maybe I can pass for her’ but to me it’s just funny. “The way I carry myself on a daily basis has changed - I like going out again, being in public and feeling good about myself.”  Dr Franklin Rose, of Utopia Plastic Surgery  Med Spa, performed the surgery on Xochytl in November last year. Xochytl’s new look was unveiled at a High Tea event in Houston, earlier this month, during which she felt more empowered than ever. The mum said since her surgery children Brandon, , Kai, , and little Isla have benefited all the more as she has more energy. She added: “When my surgery was unveiled it felt like I was the Princess for the day, it was a great experience and I really enjoyed it. “I feel very self-assured and very confident now. I don’t have to try on five dferent outfits every day before figuring out what I want to wear now too.   “I can throw on the first thing I pick and know I look great, there is a new sense of confidence that Doctor Rose helped me to achieve.” Dr Rose said: “Meghan Markle arguably is one the most famous of all the royals at the present time. “She is always in the news and she is very pretty, like the actress Grace Kelly when marrying the Prince of Monaco. “Meghan Markle is very pretty so people want her nose. “Xochytl says herself confidence is through the roof and she feels great about herself now - plastic surgery has this tremendous, positive effect on body image and self-esteem. “She resembled Meghan Markle before but now looks even more like her.

The two leaders will try to reach an agreement on a Norths Korean pledge to give up its nuclear weapons programme Trump is due to arrive in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, later on Tuesday. They will meet the next day for a brief one-on-one conversation, followed by a social dinner, at which they will each be accompanied by two guests and interpreters. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One that would be followed by more meetings between the two leaders on Thursday.   Their talks come eight months after their historic summit in Singapore, the first between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. While there is no real expectation that the second meeting will bring a final deal on ridding North Korea of nuclear weapons that threaten the US, there are some hopes it could lead to a declaration that the - Korean War is at last formally over. But the United States would expect signicant movement by Kim towards denuclearisation in .  In Singapore, Kim pledged to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but the vague agreement struck there has produced few concrete results. US Democratic senators and security officials have warned Trump against cutting a deal that would do little to curb North Koreas nuclear ambitions. Kim, who travelled from the North Korean capital by train, arrived at the station in the Vietnamese town of Dong Dang after crossing over the border from China. Vietnamese officials were on hand to receive him at the station with a red-carpet including a guard of honour and North Korean and Vietnamese flags flying.   Kim was seen leaving the train in Dong Dang and getting into a Mercedes Benz vehicle for the  mile journey to the capital, Hanoi, by car. He waved from the car before setting off to young people lining the street waving Vietnamese and North Korean flags. About a dozen body guards ran along side his car as he set off. Both Kim and Trump are also due to hold separate talks with Vietnamese leaders. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also arrived in Hanoi, on Tuesday, a reporter travelling with him said.  Pompeo has been Trumps top envoy in his efforts to improve ties with the reclusive North and has made several trips to Pyongyang to negotiate steps towards ending its nuclear programme. Trump told reporters he and Kim would have a very tremendous summit. Tweeting on Monday, he stressed the benefits to North Koreait gave up its nuclear weapons. With complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision! Trump said. In a speech on Sunday night, Trump, however, appeared to play down any hope of a major breakthrough at the Hanoi summit, saying he would be happy as long as North Korea maintained its pause on weapons testing.

Not that we really thought or spoke about it but I donrsquot think we were too far away from getting to the record of clean sheets and wersquod got there by playing some very good football.ldquoItrsquos disappointing. Something Irsquove never seen before. Itrsquos a bit embarrassing to be honest. Irsquom sure they woke up on Monday morning and were a bit embarrassed of how theyrsquove handled it. They had the chance to recty the situation after and did nothing about it.ldquoThe amount of work that we put in to those games before with the clean sheets, the way we defendedhellip and itrsquos gone out of the window for something that shouldnrsquot really happen in football.ldquoFor us to come in and them to say lsquoyou won the game anywayrsquo hellip thatrsquos just absolutely pathetic.James Scott set the goal up when he latched onto a throw-in that Liam Grimshaw had put into the left channel. As play slowed anticipating a casual passing of the ball back, it quickly became apparent that the teenager was going for goal.Scott looked sheepish as he left the pitch later in the game, almost apologising to his bench, and Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson cited the inexperience of the player as the reason for the goal that flouted convention.Bain, though, was scornful of the reasons offered as he insisted that the responsibility for it ought to have been taken by the Motherwell management.ldquoTheir manager tried to blame it on a young lads but yoursquod got the chance to recty the situation after and they donrsquot do it, said Bain.ldquoI dunno. So, what has [Scott] not watched football before  Hersquos not played a game before  Youth team levels all the way up, it happens at every level. I thinkyou are the manager you have to recty the situation.ldquoI donrsquot understand what he was thinking. Hersquos tried to blame it on a young lad but hersquos in charge. So between him and the rest of the players they can sort it out. But obviously they didnrsquot want to. They wanted to try and get a second goal and get a point or go on to win the game.It will be interesting to note just what happens in the next fixtures between the sidesthere is a similar scenario of a player on either side requiring treatment. Bainrsquos fury was still simmering as he suggested that he would be playing tit-for-tat in any future matches, but that would seem unlikely given Brendan Rodgersrsquo is always at pains to stress a respect for opponents.Still, though,it was up to Bain there would be no such understanding.ldquoIf it was up to me  No. Not a chance, he said. ldquoIn future wersquoll probably just play with  men and not put the ball out of play. So our players could be lying down seriously injured. But it happened and we go from there.ldquoMost of the boys were angry and they have the right to be. It is not something we would do and it is not something I have seen anyone do, really. They have the right to be angry and for five or ten minutes it disjointed us a little bit and they came into the game but after the game against Valencia and how much all the boys put into that game and to power through again and get another two goals and win comfortably says a lot about the character in the team.\""},{"url":null,"title":"thanks-for-the-memories-glasgows-old-cinemas","story":"LA SCALA, the Electreum, The Paramount, the ABChellip"},{"url":null,"title":"swoty-2018-and-youngswoty-2018-meet-the-finalists","story":"MEET the world-changing women who are in the running to be crowned Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"the-highs-and-lows-of-brendan-rodgers-time-at-celtic","story":"IT has finally happened.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Now is the time for the Catholic Church   s own Reformation","story":"For this book Martel has conducted more than , interviews in the Vatican City in Rome, and across the world. He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

Jimmy Kimmel may be a big name in the US but means little where yet was the host in .That might have been a reason why the ceremonys live audience last year was the lowest in in Oscars history, averaging . million viewers, down from . million in .What we ended up with was a st Academy Awards ceremony that felt less bloated but actually ran for about the same three-houras its predecessors.In the absence of a monologue, the ceremony kicked off with original Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor rolling back the years, joined by Adam Lambert for a mini-medley of the bands classic songs featuring We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You, bringing the star-studded Oscars audience to its feet.It was the music rather than the laughs that stole the show.The immaculately choreographed performance of the Oscar winning original song Shallow by actor director Bradley Cooper and singer actress Lady Gaga was perhaps the most memorable moment of the night.With cameras placed at the back of the stage, the curtain lted and crew pusha grand piano into place with an array of blinding headlamps kissing the empty stage leaving viewers wondering what on earth was going on.Then the duo stephand-in-hand from their seats in the audience, Cooper helping Lady Gaga, whose shimmering, sleek Celine dress was a potential hazard, up the stairs to the stage.With the TV audiencestill with a back-of-stage view, Cooper sings, and Gaga stands staring into his eyes before taking her position behind the piano to play her part in this most intimate of love songs.Cooper then joins her on her piano stool and they become cocooned, steamily cheek to cheek for the denouement. It all feels so spine-tinglingly real, you do wonder what was going through the mind of Coopers partner, Russian supermodel Irina Shayk.They exitto a standing ovation, but it was, of course, meat and drink for the gossipmongers. Even Spice Girl Mel B who was a guest on the special broadcast said she was left feeling ldquouncomfortable for Coopers girlfriend.It was of course, supposed to be an act, an exercise of romantic artice, and a spin on their starring roles in the Star Is Born remake. If you like, it was four minutes encapsulating what moviemaking is about - making you believe.The laughs were less scripted.British actress Olivia Colman has come a long way from the days of her understated role as a scruffy and unstable love interest of the socially awkward and despondent loan manager played by David Mitchell in Peep Show.Since then she has become a serial winner of awards for her acting culminating in her first, surely of many, best actress Oscar for her role as as Queen Anne, the erratic and gout-ridden monarch in The Favourite.Her endearingly scatterbrained and scattergun speech has to go down as one of the most bizarre, emotional yet hilarious acceptances in recent years.She began by wiping the tears from eyes and said: \"Ooooh, its genuinely quite stressful... this is hilarious. Got an Oscar.\"In a typicallyoff-the-cuff acceptance speech, Colman said she wanted to ldquothanks lots of people and thatshe forgot anyone she would find them later and give them ldquoa massive snog.Colman said how shocked she was to be there, having once worked as a cleaner and then blew a raspberry as she was asked to wind up.She also thanked Glenn Close, who was widely tipped as the likely best actress winner, saying she had been ldquoher idol for so long this is not how I wanted it to be.She went on to thank her children Finn,  and Hall, , adding she ldquohopes they are at home and watching, because ldquothis isnrsquot going to happen again.The Oscars have major flaws, of course, and viewers have to swallow the conceit that the best movies appear to be American.And, of course, the winning films are often worthy and issue-driven with action blockbusters, comedy and horror barely getting a look in.. So the best picture winner was race relations drama Green Book and included among the eight nominated best picture gongs are BlacKkKlansman, a movie about an African-American detective inflitrating the Ku Klux Klan, and Roma, a Mexican drama about the Mexican director Alfonso Cuaroacuten upbringing in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City.Its asthe Academy are making a conscious effort to love Mexico in the midst of Donald Trumps determination to pledge to build a border wall.If that was not obvious politicisation over art, then Spike Lees comments while accepting the Best Adapted Screenplay award for BlacKkKlansman definitely was.He implored Americans to praise ancestors \"stolen from Mother Africa\" who have \"built this country into what it is today along with the genocide of its native people\".He said during Sunday nightrsquos ceremony: ldquoThe  presidential election is around the corner.

But some say what might have been a masterplan to increase pressure on Mr Maduro has only pushed the country down an even more chaotic course towards civil war.It was a gesture say critics of Mr Guaido that had more to do with provocation than humanitarianism and which left some global organisations like the UN and the International Committee of the Red Crosswarning all sides of the dangers in ldquoweaponising aid. Perhaps the most worrying aspect in all of this however is the apparent willingness of other outside players to play fast and loose with the fate of Venezuela and its people.Just what did US Senator Mark Rubio think would be the outcome of him posting two photographs of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on his Twitter account on Sunday Itrsquos well known of course that Mr Rubio is an influential voice in Washington on Venezuela policy and a staunch critic of Mr Maduro. But his tweet showing the Libyan leader bloodied and injured shortly before his death at the hands of rebel militiamen is the crudest and most incendiary of messages to Mr Maduro.That Mr Rubio had previously tweeted another photo of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who was captured in  after a US military invasion, is likewise unequivocal it its meaning and can, as intended, only be read one way by Mr Maduro. The message is simple, your time is up and forcenecessary, will be used.How Mr Rubio and those in Washington think such gestures strengthen their case for democratic change in Venezuela is baffling. Surely rather that stoke an already dangerously volatile situation, the US government should be doing all it can to ensure that such a process happens through the ballot box The Trump administration is now clearly losing patience with Mr Maduro and no longer cares how he is removed from office so long as he is and their chosen leader Mr Guaido takes over.Just last week President Trump at a speech in Miami urged ldquoVenezuelan patriots to rise up against the regime. Mr Guaido at the weekend did the same on Twitter.ldquoTodayrsquos events force me to make a decision to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom our country.For many Latin America analysts such talk bodes ill and presents serious warning signs.ldquoThere is no question that a military intervention to resolve the Venezuela crisis is more plausible than ever, Michael Shter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a US-based think- tank, told the Washington Post over the last few days as the crisis deepened.ldquoGuaidorsquos insistence that lsquoall options are on the tablersquo echoes President Trumprsquos words, first uttered in August  and widely interpreted as serious consideration of military action, warned Mr Shter.Some observers however insist that the US history of attempted regime change in the Latin American region and Mr Trumprsquos loose language are both working against the opposition that faces a still formidable foe in Mr Madurorsquos regime.Many Venezuelans remain suspicious of Washingtonrsquos motives, evenyet more defections to the opposition from within the ranks of the Venezuelan security forces have taken place over the past few days.More than  members of Venezuelarsquos armed forces defected during the clashes last weekend, with Mr Guaido promising the defectors would be given amnesty and congratulating them on joining ldquothe right side of history.Mr Maduro meanwhile still believes himself to be on the right side of history evenlast weekendrsquos blockade of foreign aid has left him facing a diplomatic siege.As the crisis worsens UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed for ldquoviolence to be avoided at any cost and insisted everyone should lower tensions.Washington however is paying little heed and more than ever seems intent in doing whatever it takes to get its way in Venezuela. ldquoThe eyes of the entire world are upon you today, every day, and every day in the future, Mr Trump told Mr Madruo in a speech last week. ldquoYou cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you, the US president warned.For now all eyes are on the outcome of yesterdayrsquos meeting in the Colombian capital Bogota between Mr Pence and Mr GuaidoIf indeed all options are on the table, as both men have made clear, then Venezuela might be about to face the most dangerous moment in this crisis so far.

A culture of ugly bullying, of neanderthal bigotry, would have been allowed to fester inside schools doing their best to instil respect and decency in children growing up within a hate-filled sectarian society scarred by The Troubles.That zero tolerance approach to bigotry within the school gates probably helped create a generation which turned its back on religious hatred and ushered in an end to violence and the beginnings of peace in the s. To be uncompromisingly tough with the worst excesses of human behaviour is often the only way to help forge a better world.So itrsquos little wonder that Scottish football, the Old Firm, and their toxic tribes of hardcore bigoted fans disgust me. Sadly, outside of Scotland, football in this country is seen through the prism of Rangers and Celtic. The Old Firm is Scottish football to most of the world. Fans of other teams may not like that fact, but itrsquos the case ndash what the Old Firm does reflects on the entire Scottish game, on every team and fan.When bitter anti-Catholic Rangers fans call Steve Clarke, the Kilmarnock manager, a ldquoFenian b******, when bitter anti-Protestant Celtic fans call Kris Boyd, the Kilmarnock striker, an ldquoOrange b******, everyone outside Scotland sees the game and its supporters through this lens.I cannot believe that supporters who view themselves as decent human beings would wish to be in any way associated with the glamorisation of sectarian hatred, with the glorication of terrorism ndash as revealed in the vile and petty songs and banners of the worst fans in both clubs. How can you support a team, or go to a game, where religious hatred exists in any form  In any other walk of le ndash any other business ndash such behaviour would spell a mass exodus of public support and concomitant financial collapse. But football is given a place of exceptionalism - and so for some, social norms can be disregarded and society debased while money is made.Decent supporters of Rangers and Celtic ndash of whom there are many ndash may not like to be lumped in with the UVF-adulating mob at Ibrox, or the IRA-supporting mob at Celtic Park, but to many people yoursquore judged by the company you keep. If I stand peaceably in a crowd enjoying a game of football but within that same crowd there are fans chanting ldquoFenian b****** or ldquoOrange b******rsquorsquo, I have to accept that this isnrsquot a good look for me. Some might see me as guilty by association. Some might see me as passively accepting what is happening. Some might see me as too cowardly to disassociate myself from such behaviour. Some might think I get a little vicarious thrill from what is going on. At the very best Irsquom guilty of being a bystander ndash of deciding the game, the club, is more important than common decency.But supporters are supporters, and clubs are quite a dferent thing, and some ndash like Rangers and Celtic, it could be saidndash sit atop mountains of gold mined from bigotry and hatred. Perhaps these clubs havenrsquot deliberately enriched themselves by allowing sectarianism to flourish within their grounds, but as long as such behaviour continues they are guilty of passive acceptance, of a failure of responsibility.If I own a company and a byproduct of my work as a business is something seen as a social ill, then I have to take responsibility for it. Social media companies are being pilloried every day ndash rightly ndash for failing to act over fake news or abuse. The CEOs are dragged before politicians, therersquos public talk of boycotts. But with football, itrsquos simply a matter of exceptionalism.Irsquom sick to death of hearing excuses for the so-called beautul game ndash itrsquos a bloody ugly game and it needs dragged to heel as roughly as possible. Humza Yousaf spoke for a silent majority of decent people across Scotland at the weekend when he issued what he called ldquoa very stark warning to football clubs. Mr Yousaf said that the ldquoGovernment is looking at every single option that is on the table, including strict liability and stadium licensing. I cheered as loudly as any football fan when I heard him say that. Mr Yousaf has put the clubs on warning thatthey donrsquot act, the Government will.ldquoStrict liability is just a complicated way of saying the clubs will be fined and suffer other sanctions, and stadium licensing means that a game could be played with no fans in attendance. Mr Yousaf should impose a ticking clock now, giving the clubs a limited window of time to get their act together. If, and when, the clubs fail to take what he described as ldquodefinitive measures to deal with sectarianism then the Government needs to take control and pass legislation ndash and make the legislation draconian, so once a club is hit, the fines and empty stadiums will leave them cowed and obedient.Similarly, the police and prosecution service must ensure that any breach of the law by fans within or outwith football grounds is cracked down on fearsomely. If a fan so much as drops litter in the street, then arrest them. Anything even remotely resembling harassment or intimidation should end in court and a criminal record.Docking of points should be a regular sanction ndash either legislation should cover it, or government should strong-arm footballing authorities to use such powers. Hit the clubs where it hurts: in their pockets, and wreck ambitions for sporting glory.When football in Scotland becomes a sport that you would happily take your children to, then and only then can it call itself the beautul game.Read more: Whataboutery is no defence"},{"url":null,"title":"chinas-social-credit-system-a-ratings-nightmare-straight-out-of-black-mirror-or-an-exercise-in-rebuilding-trust","story":"ldquoOnce you lose trust,the slogan says, ldquoyou will face restrictions everywhere.By , every citizen will have a centrally-logged lsquosocial creditrsquo score, akin to a credit reference.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those wrecks are still the primary focus of recreational ers, but the remains of the vessels that were mostly recovered and removed from Scapa Flow have also been a recognised ing resource for many years.However, the exact extent and composition of these so-called salvage sites was unknown until this week, when the report of the second phase of work on these sites was published online.The overall aim of the Scapa Flow Salvage Sites Project was to determine what remains of the many vessels of the German High Seas Fleet that were salvaged in the years that followed their scuttling in June .Phase One, undertaken over the winter of  , involved a side scan sonar survey of the main anchorages and other areas thought to have been involved in the salvage process.In the second phase of this project, ers and remotely operated vehicles examined and recorded the remains in detail.The overall result is that the vast majority of salvage sites in Scapa Flow have been located and the remains at each site have been directly investigated and recorded.The full report is now available for public download through the Scapa Flow Historic Wreck website http:www.scapaflowwrecks projects salvage-sites-phase- Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Tuesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

David Lammy, a prominent Remain-supporting Labour MP, said Corbyn was “taking the first step to reunite our party by showing he is listening to our voters and members on this, the biggest issue of our time”.: Brexit: Labour to back second referendum in parliamentIt is often said that the EU referendum was held in an attempt to solve an internecine war within the Conservative party. Now, it seems, Labour’s internal troubles could bring about another one.Clearly, the chances of this actually happening will depend on the attitude of many Conservative MPs – and not just Remain ones. Labour’s decision could simply prompt Brexiteer MPs to drop their opposition to May’s deal, fearing the ‘will of the people’ is now pro-Remain.But,a second vote does come about, the big question will be the question. BrexitRef would undoubtedly be a isive affair and there would be a serious risk of a boycott by Brexiteers, which could cause potentially irreparable harm to democracy in this country.So considerable efforts would need to be made to try to bring Farage, Rees-Mogg and the like on board.

Red-carpeted self-congratulations, the popping of flashes and the anticipation of the popping of corks at the many after parties for the rich and famous. And, once again, another Academy Awards in which no women were mentioned in the important category of best director, writes Dr Claire Jenkins.In the  years that the awards have been running, only five women have been nominated for this coveted award – and only one, Kathryn Bigelow, has come away with the statuette: this represents about one per cent of nominees and winners. It’s a shockingly low statistic, even when you take into account that a mere eight per cent of Hollywood’s top  films in  were directed by women. In  America’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found Hollywood to be guilty of discrimination against female directors, but as yet there have been no signicant shts in the number of women directing.\u2028\u2028But while there is clearly much to do, there may be some small tremors discernible on Hollywood’s Geiger counter. Take Mimi Leder‘s newest film On the Basis of Sex, about the career of US Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Leder was effectively ostracised by Hollywood after the commercial failure of Pay it Forward , so herto directing with a biopic of one of America’s most prominent feminist icons suggests that Hollywood is softening in its treatment of women on, and off, screen.\u2028\u2028Leder’sto the director’s chair comes alongside the impressive success of Ava DuVernay, who has been breaking ground for women of colour in the film industry. DuVernay became the first African-American woman to make over USm at the American domestic box office with A Wrinkle in Timeand was subsequently offered a m deal with Warner Bros. This deal came despite the film’s lukewarm critical reception, and claims that it was helped to box office success by The Incredibles , with which it was paired at ious drive-ins in the US. It should be noted that DuVernay’s deal with Warner Bros was to develop television content. It is in the television and streaming sectors that women seem to have more opportunities. It was as a television director that Leder has been working since her film career faltered, gaining acclaim for her work on The Leftovers, and DuVernay has oscillated between television and film – taking on a number of producing roles for the small screen.\u2028\u2028: Oscars : Olivia Colman named best actress in shock win\u2028\u2028The current Hollywood climate continues to favour male filmmakers, with its penchant for high-octane action blockbusters and superhero movies that are more often than not films for – and about – men. Coverage of the forthcoming Captain Marvel movie may be trying to draw on the film’s feminist credentials – with its female lead and female director – but Anna Boden is only one half of the directorial team . So despite Marvel boss Kevin Feige’s claims that “many” of the upcoming Marvel films will be directed by women, as yet no movie from what is known as the “Marvel Cinematic Universe”has a female director, although Australian director Cate Shortland is expected to helm the Black Widow film.\u2028\u2028EvenMCU and other action-producers continue to hire women directors, though, this will not necessarily affect the Oscars – Black Panther currently standing as the only MCU movie to be nominated.\u2028\u2028Big-budget, but low-brow action movies are generally overlooked during awards season – instead it’s those films that we might term “Indiewood”, independent-style films funded or distributed by specialist arms of the major studios, that tend to be celebrated. In , two of the three English language films nominated for best director were distributed by major studios, or their specialist arms. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, and BlacKkKlansman was distributed by Focus Features, a subsidiary of Universal.\u2028\u2028Independent filmmaking has, historically, offered more opportunities for women directors, and therefore the lack of women nominated for the Best Director award seems even more pronounced. Although figures for women working within the independent sector are less well publicised, the Celluloid Ceiling Report suggested that women are better represented in the independent sector, making up  per cent of the directors of narrative features screened at festivals in  and .\u2028\u2028: Academy refuses to pull James Bulger film from Oscars despite family’s plea\u2028\u2028Statistics such as these demonstrate that women directors are working in the American industry, but the big studios are failing to hire them and the Academy is failing to recognise them.\u2028\u2028Women directors slated for nods this awards season all made films that fall into the independent or Indiewood category: Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here and Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me.\u2028\u2028Anne Fletcher’s latest film Dumplin’ was independently produced and distributed by Netflix. Fletcher had box office success with mainstream rom-coms including  Dressesand The Proposalbut after the failure of Hot Pursuit it appears that she too has been pushed out of the mainstream.\u2028\u2028That Dumplin’ was distributed by Netflix, and You Were Never Really Here was distributed by Amazon Studios, demonstrates that there are dferent outlets for women within the changing media culture but there is still a lack of support for women in the mainstream – the big studios. And even those women who have had success in Hollywood are rarely recognised for their achievements.\u2028\u2028The death of Penny Marshall in December was met with a public outpouring of grief via social media and popular press. She was hailed as a trailblazer as the first woman to make over m at the American domestic box office with Big . But Marshall is not a household name. Big is remembered as the film that made Tom Hanks’ name, not Marshall’s. Marshall is just the first in a long string of women who have changed Hollywood, but they are not recognised for their achievements.\u2028\u2028The American film industry must do better – in hiring women directors, in rewarding women directors and in highlighting and protecting their legacies.\u2028\u2028Dr Claire Jenkins is a lecturer in film and television studies at Leicester University.

And we have called for it to do the same with the two-child cap on claims for tax credits and Universal Credit, and the rape clause that comes with it. Let’s call this what it is, a particularly abhorrent piece of Tory social engineering, which forces women to re-live the trauma of being raped as part of a claim for financial support for a child.These measures, as illustrative as they are, barely scratch the surface of the level of cuts to social security imposed by the Tories since  – and, of course, supported by the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government. Billions of pounds slashed from benefits and support programmes for the very people who most need our help: sick, disabled and unemployed people, and those who rely on extra support because they are not paid enough to live on. Cruel cuts underpinned by a cruel sanctions regime, so painfully and accurately portrayed in the film ‘I, Daniel Blake’, based partly on people’s experiences in Scotland.This is the brutal reality of austerity. A political choice to use the power of the state in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, not to make iniduals’ lives better and to improve society as a whole, but to tear people’s lives apart. And this is without even mentioning the tens of billions of pounds cut from our public services.: Tony Blair: Scotland would be independentnot for devolutionAnd it is before we have even begun to consider the Tories’ despicable hostile environment that targets migrants, conceived by Theresa May as Home Secretary and continued under her as Prime Minister. Remember those ad vans sent out by May’s Home Office with the nasty threat “Go home or face arrest”  Policies rooted in the worst instincts of the Tory Party, egged on by sections of the press whose front pages regularly scream about the threat posed by migration but never shout about the positive benefits it brings to our country, our culture and our way of le.But it is not some fanatical Tory clique in England that claims all of this is “necessary”, this is the Conservative Party right across the UK including here in Scotland. Ruth Davidson has proudly talked about how she backed Theresa May as leader, and how she “will back her in the future”. Scottish Secretary David Mundell and stand-in Scottish leader Jackson Carlaw line up foursquare behind the Prime Minister, even as her Brexit shambles goes from farce to horror.This is the Conservative Party that former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair bizarrely said last week had claimed the “middle ground” of politics. If that is the middle ground, I shudder to think what would be right of centre.Scottish Labour has serious work to do, no one in our party is pretending otherwise and no one has ever claimed it is easy-going. We are rebuilding after years of decline and a series of electoral shocks, not least the  General Election when all but one of our  MPs were voted out, including the then leader Jim Murphy.Far from abandoning the mythical “middle ground” which, in truth, only pundits talk about, we are rebuilding on the basis of popular, common sense policies that focus on the real change that Scotland needs. An end to austerity and the cuts to social security and local services, and public ownership of our trains, buses, energy and Royal Mail, to put people before profit. We need Labour governments in Scotland and across the UK to put this into practice.Of course, it was gravely disappointing that just over a week ago a small group of Labour MPs chose to walk away, to join forces with former Tory MPs in a new Independent Group. In going, they have raised some important issues about Labour, not least the issue of antisemitism which we are determined to root out of our party and wider society. There is no place for antisemitism in the Labour Party.But they have also been clear that their disagreements range wider and are on matters of policy. In a magazine interview, one of the former Labour MPs has already criticised plans to bring the railways into public ownership and raise the top rate of tax. Another has suggested the group could replace the DUP in propping up the Tory Government. The first act of one of their former Tory colleagues was to declare that the coalition government, which ushered in austerity and led to record levels of poverty and homelessness, “did a marvellous job”.: Lesley Riddoch: Citizens’ Assemblies could help build a new ScotlandThese are very dferent ideas to the ones that proved so popular in the  election and which they were elected to Parliament on, so it is right that their constituents get the chance to ask them in by-elections what they now stand for. The group claims to represent a new, forward-looking “centre ground”. Butall it is going to offer is support for austerity, tax breaks for the rich and privatisation of public services, it will look very much like the failed politics of the past.No one yet knows what the political fall-out will be. But it will not deter Labour from our mission to bring the curtain down on this rotten Tory Government and so to see the back of the party of social security cuts, the two-child cap, austerity, homelessness, foodbanks and inequality. And it will not deter us from campaigning to win back people’s trust and so to win power again in the Scottish Parliament.We stand for something completely dferent. We don’t look at the housing crisis and see an opportunity to blame and punish the very people it affects the most. We won’t cut the lelines from our communities and our industries, we will invest in them, and we will build an economy and a society where everyone benefits, not just a wealthy few.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit labour to back public vote in parliament","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Jeremy Corbyn threw a leline to supporters of a second EU referendum, saying Labour would back efforts to bring about a so-called People#s Vote in a bid to placate anger in his party that saw eight MPs walk out.In the most signicant step towards a new vote on Brexit, the Labour leader said he was committed to “putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.However, a second EU referendum still face a signicant hurdles, with a People’s Vote still unable to command majority support in the Commons.The announcement comes with Downing Street braced for resignations today by Remain-supporting ministers left unmoved by Theresa May’s promise of a vote on her Brexit agreement by  March, just  days before the UK could crash out of the EU without a deal.One senior government insider said Number  was “very worried” about ministers walking out over the failure to accept a delay to Brexit in order to rule out a no-deal.“If there aren’t any resignations by ministers or PPSs [Personal Parliamentary Secretaries] today, we’ll be very surprised,” the source said.At a press conference in Egypt on the margins of an EU-Arab summit, Mrs May said she was sticking to her timetable to deliver Brexit on  March.“It’s within our grasp to leave with a deal on March  and that’s where all of my energies are going to be focused,” she said.“An extension to Article , a delay in this process, doesn’t deliver a decision in Parliament, it doesn’t deliver a deal. All it does is precisely what the word ‘delay’ says.”AskedMPs might be asked to vote on additional assurances over the controversial Irish border backstop on  March, before they have been formally signed off by EU leaders at a summit a week later, the Prime Minister told reporters: “It is possible to do it either way.”European Council president Donald Tusk revealed he discussed legal details of extending the Article  withdrawal process in talks with Mrs May when they met on Sunday in Egypt.Mr Tusk said delaying the UK’s withdrawal is now a “rational solution”, warning that the only alternativeMPs cannot agree a deal is “a chaotic Brexit”.And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who had talks with Mrs May in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, said the UK needed to “wake up”.Mr Rutte said: “We are sleepwalking into a no-deal scenario. It’s unacceptable and your best friends have to warn you.“Wake up. This is real. Come to a conclusion and close the deal.”In a furious Brexit diplomatic effort on the fringes of a summit focused on Middle East cooperation, Mrs May also met with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Italy’s Giuseppe Conte.The Prime Minister confirmed that Brexit negotiators willto Brussels on Tuesday for further talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.: Lib Dems won’t back ing to EUShe will make a statement to the Commons this afternoon ahead of votes on Brexit tomorrow, knowing that senior cabinet ministers and up to  of her MPs could rebel to back amendments ruling out a no-deal scenario.At the weekend, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and Justice Secretary David Gauke threatened to back an amendment put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin, which seeks to block a no-deal through legislationthere no Brexit agreement in place by  March - a day after Mrs May’s deadline for a ‘meaningful vote’.The government source said any ministers who backed the amendment “will be expected to resign”.With the threat of further resignations by and the party losing support in the polls, Mr Corbyn told a meeting of his parliamentarians that Labour would “do everything in our power to prevent No Deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May’s overwhelmingly rejected deal.: David Mundell: SNP want no-deal Brexit“That’s why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country.”Labour is in talks with backbench MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson over an amendment they are proposing that would approve Mrs May’s deal, but put it to a public vote. The Labour leadership would rather voters be presented with a choice between its own deal and remaining in the EU, as it tries to strike a balance between pro- and anti-Brexit opinion amongst its supporters.The Kyle-Wilson amendment is not expected to be tabled tomorrow, but could be pushed forward on the day of the meaningful vote in March.Last night the shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour would seek a “deal or remain” referendum.Politicians and campaigners backing a People’s Vote issued a cautious welcome to the announcement. Edinburgh MP Ian Murray, one of its strongest advocates, said the announcement was “signicant progress”, but said campaigners had to “win the arguments to get a majority in Parliament to win a public vote with the option to remain”.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “A referendum with no remain option would be ludicrous”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1433384.jpg--.jpg?1549442071000\n","title":"cambridge house schoolfriends collaborate for charity single","story":"A BALLYMENA writer and his singer schoolfriend have teamed up to release a new single, the proceeds of which will be donated to a mental health charity.Daryl Ball and Marc Little both attended Cambridge House and both became involved in the arts in later le - but are now joining forces thanks to a chance encounter with a book.Daryl, who records as a solo artist as well as being a member of the Ballymena band Stripped, explained: An old schoolfriend Marc Little had a book of poetry published in .Its called Out Of Darkness and it was a very personal collection by Marc dealing with dficult yet common subjects like anxiety and depression.I bought a copy last year and really enjoyed his writing style as well as being very moved by the honesty in his poetry. “They inspired me to write a song on subject.I contacted Marc to ask would he mindI used words from two of his poems to create a new song.He was excited by the idea of working together and I agreed to send a rough demo to make sure he was happy with my treatment of it before proceeding.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

To define a new and united Ireland,” she said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn Fein is more focused on a poll than a sensible Brexit deal. “Indeed, judging by their hard border rhetoric, Sinn Fein seem to be cheerleaders for a ‘no deal ‘exit.” he said.And UUP MLA Doug Beattie said that with health and education “on their knees,” a poll would “further ision and instability”. But TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Varadkar is only stalling because he wants the backstop in place first, “as the republican building block it is”.Alliance leader Naomi Long was open to a poll, but agreed with the SDLP that “the time is not right” due to Brexit.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school. When he comes back there will be another jeep sitting there or another car sitting there, sometimes marked sometimes unmarked.“This week he was going to get his child from a school event and they stopped him. He pleaded his case that he was running late to pick up his kids and the PSNI boot-boys told him he would stay as long as they ‘saw fit’.“A few weeks ago, I went to pick my son up and I was pulled over and the man said ‘are you in a hurry, Mr Kelly ’ I said I had to pick up my son and told him to get on with whatever he was doing. Again they said ‘you’ll be here as long as we want’. I was there for about ten minutes and I was late to pick up my son.“It’s not just political activists who experience what this brings, it’s also our families – our kids and our partners. Our partners are being intimidated. Two years ago I was approached by MI on the Grosvenor and they followed my partner as she was bringing my daughter to crèche.“The try to intimidate our family members when we’re not there. It’s clear that the ‘reformed’ police service, as they are called by those who work alongside them, are only accommodating to those who tow the line of the establishment. Those who stand in opposition to the British police force in Ireland are fair game, and that also extends to our families.”He continued: “It’s no coincidence that this attempt at criminalising the republican socialist movement, it is starting to rise again when our party is starting to grow and we are doing fantastic work in Belfast.“It will fail today as it has done over the  years of the existence of our party. It will continue to be rejected by those on the ground who we work on behalf of.”The Andersonstown News has contacted the PSNI over the IRSP’s claims and is awaiting a response."},{"url":null,"title":"how ireland rugby hero jacob stockdale tackles being christian in rugby world","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I would like to see this work completed soon.Cllr Curran said the petition contained the names of concerned parents, community representatives and local residents and hoped the new path can be delivered sooner, rather than later.ldquoParents are keen to see the path provided to increase the safety of children who walk to and from the school. While new speed limits have been introduced in the village, speeding drivers remains a concern, he said.ldquoThe safety of the children who attend the primary school is of paramount importance as indeed is the safety of residents who walk along this particular route.The local politician, who thanked Angela Wills for helping compile the petition, hopes roads officials will act, highlighting the importance of having a safe connection between St Maryrsquos and Chapeltown.Cllr Curran said that while the villagersquos new speed limits were a welcome addition, the provision of the new path must be a priority to help ensure that a busy rural area is safer for all road users.Cllr Enright said community groups around the Dunsford area had joined forces to support the campaign for the new path to connect the school to the nearby church and community centre. He also confirmed that another petition calling for the footpath had secured around  signatures.He continued: ldquoSome progress to deliver the new path was achieved last month with a site visit by roads officials which I organised when school principal Ronan Fitzpatrick and parish priest Fr Gerald McCloskey had the opportunity to walk the route with them.ldquoHopefully this campaign is now on the cards for success. The most recent on-site review with roads officials produced an extra  points for this project bringing it up to . This makes it a project that roads officials might look at,there is enough political and community pressure.Cllr Enright said thatthe new path project was to proceed, all parties must make what he described as a ldquogenuine effort to pull together and support the school.He added: ldquoThis project has all the features of a campaign that can succeed.

It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9428616.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March . Wersquore really looking forward to it.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This usually means by the Minister in the Department of Communities but with no Stormont this onus now falls to civil servants. The regional rate is further complicated because as yet there is no budget set for Northern Ireland for the coming year.This makes it almost impossible for civil servants to establish what the regional rate needs to be. The budget, in the absence of Stormont, is set by the Secretary of State. This is Karen Bradley at present.On to the next step.The regional rate and district rate are each given a dferent percentage, which together add up to  per cent, when calculations are made.For non-domestic rates, the district rate is given a percentage of  and the regional rate a percentage of .So taking the district rate of . percent struck at the council meeting that is now multiplied by . to reflect the above percentage which means that the decision by council will result in . percent of a rise in your non domestic rates bill.But that is not the end of the story.Because we must now wait for the increase in the regional rate, which is expected in the coming month. For argument sake let us say we will see an increase of  per cent.  would be multiplied by . which would give an increase of . per cent.This figure must then be added to the figure of . from the district rate to get the total percentage increase. In doing this we come to a total increase of . percent.For non-domesticrates the mechanism is the same, but the weighting of regional and district rate is dferent.

However Mr Nesbitt said that he was “realistic” about the current situation and added: “I do wonder whether Brexit will prove to be the biggest own goal in  years from unionists. “I know a lot of the emphasis is on the border and on tarf and on trade - and these things are important and need to be resolved - but the other issue is identity.“The Belfast Agreement made very clear that we all self-define in identity and we can be British or Irish or both...I know there are a lot of people who feel they were diminished on  June  by that result for Brexit and a lot of them believe that what happened there was that English nationalists came in over their heads and did exactly what the Agreement said couldn’t happen - denied them their sense of being European. They feel diminished and the consequence is that the constitutional question is back on the table for the first time in  years. Where it leads, nobody knows.”Mr Nesbitt backed remain in the referendum but saw his party ided on the issue.Appealing to nationalists, he said: “If you’re going to have a border poll...don’t let it be like Brexit. Before there’s a border poll it has to be spelled out in enormous detail – and truthfully, unlike Brexit – ‘these are the implications should you choose to vote for constitutional change’.”Citing practical issues from the nature of the health service to the sort of police force which would operate after a vote for Irish unity, Mr Nesbitt said it was the responsibility of those arguing for an end to partition to explain what it would mean in practical terms.But although the Strangford MLA made clear that he continued to firmly believe in the Union and that it was up to nationalists to convince him otherwise, he added: “I know of people from a unionist background who are now basically thinking the unthinkable and just basically asking the question ‘would I be better off or worse off ’”Mr Nesbitt said that his fear for unionism was that as well as Brexit being an “own goal”, the wider social and political environment is changing but unionism might not be reacting quickly enough to the altered landscape.The former victims’ commissioner said he accepted that in any border polleither side got % plus one then they would be the winner. However, he said that such a scenario would be a “disaster” and a decisive result would be far better.David Murphy funeral: Some people will only remember the bad he did Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

The building is being marketed by Osborne King and RHM Commercial. “Given the lack of available grade A office accommodation in Belfast we are excited to bring a building of this size and quality to the market,” Richard McCaig of Osborne King said. “In our experience deliverability of projects is key in order to attract tenants and Lighthouse offers the chance for an occupier to secure the largest amount of existing office space available in the city.” Nick Rose of RHM said it is “extremely rare for an entire building of this quality to become available”. “The superb location combined with a signicant car parking provision will undoubtedly prove attractive to the market. Given that Lighthouse is a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall and adjoins the -bed Radisson Blu Hotel we expect signicant interest from corporate occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"kainos taking on bankmore square for belfast office scheme","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Tech firm Kainos will take on a massive proposed office scheme in Belfast for its new headquarters, it has emerged.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
