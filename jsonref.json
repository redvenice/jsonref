They are so many models from other races black, Asian and so many more she is a role model for many young girls. This photoshoot is an insult to all the beautiful black women.’‘There’s a difference between getting a tan look (most of her pics) to actually changing her pigment to a shade of brown that a tan would never do AKA unnatural AF,’ says another.‘Also her face has been altered SO hard.

homes.Hawaii County said steam and lava poured out of a crack in Leilani Estates, which is near the town of Pahoa on the Big Island.Earlier in the week, the crater floor of the Puu Oo vent collapsed, causing magma to push more than 10 miles downslope towards the populated south-east coastline of the island.Hawaii County spokeswoman Janet Snyder said red lava emerged on Mohala Street. The county has ordered evacuations for homes from Luana Street to Pohohiki Road.It is not known how many homes are covered by the evacuation order.The crater’s floor collapsed on May 1 and is since then continuing to erode its walls and generating huge explosions of ash (Picture: EPA)A nearby community centre has opened for shelter. A school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roads cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.USGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.Hawaii County Civil Defence Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 ft high.

The Columbine killers killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High, in Colorado in 1999\u0027Those two teenagers researched and discussed those killers and their interest in them turned to hero-worship. \u0027It was against that background that they plotted their own attack upon the school they attended.\u0027In that attack, they intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance.\u0027They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end.\u0027Mr Greaney said: \u0027They intended a re-enactment of the Columbine High School Massacre although fortunately, in the result, they were stopped before their plans were put into action.\u0027Police deploy two helicopters and up to 50 officers to keep...Trial of men accused of killing Cuomo aide Carey Gabay shown...One of Britain\u0027s longest-serving prisoners who once made a...University worker nicknamed Spock who murdered his female...Share this articleThe defendants sat outside the dock, behind their lawyers, in Court 1 of Leeds Crown Court as Mr Greaney began to outline the case.  Both deny a joint charge of conspiracy to murder relating to a period between December 31 2016 and October 29 2017They have also each pleaded not guilty to a charge of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence and a charge of encouraging or assisting an offence believing it would be committed. The two defendants agreed at some stage no later than late September 2017 to commit murder at the school they attended - but their plan was foiled before being put into action, the jury was told.The older boy, who appeared to be the leader of the two plotters, condoned the Columbine High School Massacre and modelled himself on Harris, it was said in court today. Diary entries revealed he kept deeply offensive Nazi and anti-Semitic views. He met his then 14-year-old girlfriend in June 2017, the jury heard, and she soon became dependent on him and he began to control her.Then, the girl told police, \u0027the darker stuff started\u0027 and she became afraid of him.The older defendant appears to have watched a video on YouTube entitled, \u0027how to carve someone\u0027, a court heard.

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/21/4BD27E4F00000578-0-image-a-77_1525379557899.jpg","title":"Wine bottle explodes man tries open BLOW TORCH","story":"One Chicago man and his friend proudly filmed themselves trying to open a bottle of wine with a blow torch, not knowing they would go viral for all the wrong reasons\u0027How to open a bottle of wine,\u0027 his friend behind the camera formally announces as he turns the torch on.The man holds the blue flame to the neck of the bottle and gives the wine a spin as his cameraman laughs in delight.He continues to torch the cork for 16 seconds, aiming it toward the top of the bottle when it suddenly explodes.Glass goes flying everywhere as the neck of the bottle shatters, sending the man ducking for cover.The cameraman yelps before bursting out into laughter. \u0027That\u0027s how you open a bottle of wine,\u0027 he declares.

The fund will pay their wages.As part of his offering, he will also announce proposals to drop an accountability measure that names and shames ‘coasting’ schools. It has been hated by teachers since it was introduced three years ago as the Government had originally said those identified would be forced to become academies.The new sabbaticals for teachers will act as a reward for those with ten or more years of experience and will enable them to work on projects that complement their work in the classroom. Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/16/05B1A790000003E8-5687617-image-a-25_1525361189569.jpg","title":"Sajid Javid Afghan interpreters allowed stay UK without fees","story":"    In his first newspaper article as Home Secretary, Sajid Javid (pictured) has announced he will guarantee Afghan interpreters who served in Helmand Province will be able to stay in the UKThe commitment and bravery shown by our local interpreters while our Armed Forces were in Afghanistan was extraordinary. As the Mail has highlighted, they worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk.Put simply, we would not have been able to carry out our work there without them.It was in recognition of this unique and exceptional service to the UK that we made the offer of relocating these iniduals and their families.Around 400 people have already taken up the offer and have relocated with their families, meaning in total around 1,100 people are now living in the UK.For almost five years they have been building their lives here, contributing to local communities, and we cannot allow those who have been through so much to have their lives disrupted again. I know some have felt uncertainty about their future – an issue I\u0027ve been following for some time.As I said when I stood at the despatch box on my first day in this job, I want to ensure that we have an immigration system that is fair and humane. That\u0027s why today – as one of my first acts as Home Secretary – I am announcing that I will be bringing forward new immigration rules which will ensure that the Afghan interpreters who have been making this country their home will have a route to permanent settlement. And I am also waiving the fees so they won\u0027t have to pay a penny for it.

Everyone was given the opportunity to bring family members over with them when they came to the UK.But I know that some people still have family members in Afghanistan. We said they could resettle here with their families – and I am determined that we respect the commitment we made. So I will be looking again at whether we can make that process easier.

Irresistible: Every year, Keith Fielder admires this gorgeous pink and white magnolia tree in Park Road, north west London           Pictured is Christopher Marsh\u0027s magnolia tree in Puttenham, Surrey against stunning blue skies and country backdrop Many species are tender and will not survive in any but the mildest British gardens. Others require a distinctly acidic soil in order to thrive. But two species with more adaptability have come to dominate our modern gardens and streets.The first to flower is Magnolia stellata, the star magnolia from Japan. This is perhaps the easiest to grow, adapting to most soils and situations, although happiest in sunshine. The other favourite is Magnolia x soulangeana.There are many names, clones and cultivars and all tolerate a degree of pollution — which is why they became so popular for roadside suburban developments in the 1920s and 30s.          Mail readers Jeremy and Ann Pemberton entered this picture of a bright pink magnolia tree in Richmond upon Thames           Brightening up the garden: Richard Blackburn\u0027s entry is pictured next to his house on a quiet suburban street In my garden, I grow M. x soulangeana \u0027Black Tulip\u0027 and although it\u0027s very hardy, most years the flowers get hit by late frost — although this late spring I am keeping my fingers crossed.But whatever magnolia you grow, each and every one is blessed with glorious flowers.Always position new plants in a sunny, protected site and keep them well watered. Pruning is largely unnecessary save to remove any damaged shoots or branches. With time and care, you never know, you, too, could one day have a magnificent magnolia like this in your garden.

This is a tradition among American brides.Kate Middleton will probably not be one of those adult bridesmaids, according to the Daily Express.       Starbucks new Frappuccinos have an alarming calorie countMet Gala 2018: Date, theme, hosts and moreStar Wars Day 2018: What is it, why do say \u0027May the Fourth be with you\u0027 and why people celebrate it?Tour De Yorkshire: Race route, how to watch and moreRed Dead Redemption 2 trailer, release date and everything else you need to knowSummertime Ball 2018: Everything you need to knowRoyal Wedding: The American traditions Meghan Markle will be followingFortnite hit with child safety warning by NSPCCCarrie Bickmore launches new Beanies 4 Brain Cancer range on The Project Game of Thrones actor possibly drops season 8 spoiler on InstagramLove Island 2017 couples: Where are they now? Handmaid\u0027s Tale renewed for season 3"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/16/4BCD9CDB00000578-5687445-A_16_year_old_Albert_Einstein_in_1895-a-64_1525359896736.jpg","title":"Never seen photos Albert Einstein child emerge sale 250 000","story":"A previously-unseen photograph of Albert Einstein aged five is going up for auctionA fascinating collection of letters by Albert Einstein and previously unseen pictures of the mathematician as a child are going on sale for £250,000.The archive includes a never-before-seen photo of  Einstein aged five and the only surviving letter he sent his father. The image is of Einstein in Munich in 1884 and shows him as a young boy with neatly combed and flattened hair.A second black and white photograph depicts him 11 years later when his dark curly hair had grown to the wild and straggly lengths he became known for.The items belonged to his younger sister Maja Winteler-Einstein and her husband Paul Winteler - and have been passed down the family since her death in 1951.Maja fled Europe in 1939 to join her brother in Princeton in the US, and lived out her last years with him after a stroke meant she was too ill to return to Germany after the Second World War.Many of the letters in the sale are unpublished and shed new light on Einstein\u0027s deepest thoughts as he escaped Adolf Hitler\u0027s tyrannical Nazi regime.A sombre letter from Einstein to Maja penned in September 1933, just months after Hitler seized power in Germany, spoke of his fears for the future.In the letter, which is valued at £6,000, Einstein speculates whether he could ever return to Germany again and observes \u0027the only unshakeable things are the stars and mathematics\u0027.He writes: \u0027What will happen, if we come back from Princeton next year?

They are frequently observed traveling alone or in small, unstable groups, although large aggregations may be seen on feeding and breeding grounds.Gray whales are bottom feeders, sucking sediment and amphipods that are their prey from the sea floor. Both the average and maximum life of these marine mammals is unknown, although researchers have estimated that they can live up to 80 years of age.Pantukhoff, who has led trips out to the lagoon for 25 seasons, approximates there could be anywhere been 200 to 400 hundred gray whales in the area.           Pantukhoff, 59, revealed that San Ignacio Lagoon is one of the only places in the world where tourists can experience this kind of up close and personal interaction with California gray whales          Pantukhoff revealed that there is no other species of baleen whales that \u0027actively seek out human interaction\u0027 like the California gray whales, which often approach boats          Pantukhoff, who has led trips to out to the lagoon for 25 seasons, approximates there could be anywhere been 200 to 400 hundred gray whales in the area          Pantukhoff said that his trips to see the whales have been \u0027life-changing\u0027 for many of his guests as well as himself \u0027For a lot of my guests these trips are life changing, just as they were for me,\u0027 he said.  Some even followed in Pantukhoff\u0027s footsteps and have joined him on the trips for the last 10 years.Pantukhoff wanted to do something to help protect marine life and the environment when he began leading the trips.So he founded The Whaleman Foundation, a non-profit research, education, conservation, and wildlife film production organization dedicated to protecting our oceans.

King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/05/02B1FE5F000007D0-0-image-m-4_1525408979337.jpg","title":"Theresa braces devastating losses counting begins local elections","story":"Local election voter ID check - LIVE: People denied right to vote in UK for first time ever due to lack of identification | The IndependentElectoral Commission | How to vote"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/21/4BD27E4F00000578-0-image-a-77_1525379557899.jpg","title":"Wine bottle explodes man tries open BLOW TORCH","story":"One Chicago man and his friend proudly filmed themselves trying to open a bottle of wine with a blow torch, not knowing they would go viral for all the wrong reasons\u0027How to open a bottle of wine,\u0027 his friend behind the camera formally announces as he turns the torch on.The man holds the blue flame to the neck of the bottle and gives the wine a spin as his cameraman laughs in delight.He continues to torch the cork for 16 seconds, aiming it toward the top of the bottle when it suddenly explodes.Glass goes flying everywhere as the neck of the bottle shatters, sending the man ducking for cover.The cameraman yelps before bursting out into laughter. \u0027That\u0027s how you open a bottle of wine,\u0027 he declares.

Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/16/05B1A790000003E8-5687617-image-a-25_1525361189569.jpg","title":"Sajid Javid Afghan interpreters allowed stay UK without fees","story":"    In his first newspaper article as Home Secretary, Sajid Javid (pictured) has announced he will guarantee Afghan interpreters who served in Helmand Province will be able to stay in the UKThe commitment and bravery shown by our local interpreters while our Armed Forces were in Afghanistan was extraordinary. As the Mail has highlighted, they worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk.Put simply, we would not have been able to carry out our work there without them.It was in recognition of this unique and exceptional service to the UK that we made the offer of relocating these iniduals and their families.Around 400 people have already taken up the offer and have relocated with their families, meaning in total around 1,100 people are now living in the UK.For almost five years they have been building their lives here, contributing to local communities, and we cannot allow those who have been through so much to have their lives disrupted again. I know some have felt uncertainty about their future – an issue I\u0027ve been following for some time.As I said when I stood at the despatch box on my first day in this job, I want to ensure that we have an immigration system that is fair and humane. That\u0027s why today – as one of my first acts as Home Secretary – I am announcing that I will be bringing forward new immigration rules which will ensure that the Afghan interpreters who have been making this country their home will have a route to permanent settlement. And I am also waiving the fees so they won\u0027t have to pay a penny for it.

Everyone was given the opportunity to bring family members over with them when they came to the UK.But I know that some people still have family members in Afghanistan. We said they could resettle here with their families – and I am determined that we respect the commitment we made. So I will be looking again at whether we can make that process easier.          Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, pictured visiting a military exercise in Salisbury, has also been vocal in the row over Afghan interpreters\u0027 right to remain in the UKWe will bring these changes forward to Parliament as soon as possible so that the fee waiver can take effect as quickly as possible.This isn\u0027t the only scheme that we have in place to support Afghan nationals who assisted the UK Armed Forces. My colleagues at the Ministry of Defence continue to make sure that anyone whose safety is threatened in Afghanistan, due to their work with the UK, is offered help and protection. This ranges from security advice, financial assistance or relocation to a safer part of the country.These iniduals served the UK in some of the hardest conditions. I am personally dedicated to ensuring that we repay that courageous service."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/23/4BD398AB00000578-0-image-m-26_1525387545389.jpg","title":"Juncker calls Brits working EU given Belgian citizenship not lose jobs post Brexit","story":"Labour FAILS to seize Tory crown jewels of Barnet,...Trump COULD be given honour of speech at Parliament when he...Brexiteers fear May could try to IGNORE \u0027War Cabinet\u0027...Local election chaos as voters are turned away from polling...Share this articleA mass movement of UK officials becoming Belgian after Brexit could also provoke controversy because it would mean that they would effectively take up a significant part of Belgium’s share of EU institutional positions.The move emerged after former Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday dismissed Belgium as a ‘non-nation’ and claimed the EU could only rely on support from those who ‘are on the EU payroll’.He said: ‘Nobody ever dares tell the truth about Belgium: Belgium is not a nation.

Goats were never much of a threat at Kew, where the endangered species has been carefully cultivated since a specimen was found on the tiny, volcanic Robinson Crusoe Island near Chile. But rusting iron columns and creaky windows had posed a significant danger, to plants and humans alike.A government report into the state of the national botanic gardens in 2010 concluded of the building that “urgent restoration is essential if closure is to be avoided”. Windows had been sealed shut in a 1970s refurb and masonry cladding was crumbling off in chunks. The last five years have seen 69,000 inidual elements removed and repaired and 15,000 panes of glass replaced, all under the safe cover of a temporary tent big enough to hold three Boeing 747s. It has been a mammoth undertaking, and the result is suitably breathtaking.Those who remember entering the thick green gauntlet, surrounded on all sides by dense forest, might be shocked by the pruning. For the first time since the glasshouse opened in 1862, the entire contents of the beds have been removed, soil and all, and the layout reconfigured to be more akin to the Victorian original. Ten thousand plants have been replaced with younger specimens, mostly cultivated from cuttings of their forebears, while some famous residents have been carefully returned after spending the last few years in a temporary nursery. Kew’s rarest (and loneliest) plant of all, a male Wood’s cycad, is back in position, still awaiting the discovery of a female of the species in some untrodden corner of the planet. Compared with the previous overgrown riot, where spiky leaves of cycads rubbed up against the trunks of bitter orange trees, and tree ferns competed for space with rhododendrons, it now feels more like the architecture, rather than the plants, is the star of the show.“It was heartbreaking to see some of the trees go,” says Kew’s fittingly named Greg Redwood, head of glasshouses, who has been working here for 34 years. “But some of them were hitting the roof, and it was very difficult to raise new specimens under the thick canopy.” Older plants were producing fewer seeds, making it essential to renew the collection. “After years of pruning, a lot of the plants were effectively bonsais.”The cull means that Decimus Burton’s triumph of iron and glass is fully visible for the first time in a generation. Cast-iron columns support great arcing ribs of wrought iron that leap across the space, their detail visible up close from the upper-level walkway that rings the main pavilion, providing precipitous views down to the fledging canopy. Under the guidance of heritage experts Donald Insall Associates, the ironwork has been repaired and recast in places, the decades of paintwork scrubbed off with ground garnet and repainted with five coats of the hardwearing paint used on oil rigs. Outside, the plasterwork details, previously obliterated by years of gloopy paint, are visible once again: cornucopias heave with pomegranates, pineapples and soursops, while terracotta baskets (which cleverly disguise historic chimney flues) brim with moulded flowers.Begun in 1859, the same year that Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published, the Temperate House was to be the crowning glory of Kew, a five-pavilion complex stretching almost 200 metres atop a raised berm, like a fleet of crystal tankers processing across the lawn. It was planned to be the first thing visitors would see as they entered the gardens, standing at the end of the avenue from the station as a stately beacon. “It was Burton’s tomb to himself, twice the size of his Palm House,” says project architect Amy Felton. “But like many buildings of this size, it didn’t quite go according to plan.”During the parliamentary debate to allocate funding, the influential politician and greenhouse impresario Joseph Paxton opposed the proposed cost, insisting the building could be erected for a third of the requested budget. He warned that Kew was in danger of turning into “a gaudy flower garden”. No doubt concerned by the prospect of competition for his own Crystal Palace, then run as a private venture, his objection carried weight and the Treasury only sanctioned £10,000 for Kew’s new glasshouse, rather than the £30,000 requested. The station didn’t materialise where expected either: it was ultimately built 500 metres to the north, leaving the glasshouse stranded, away from the main entrance.By the time of Burton’s death in 1881, only the central pavilion had been completed. The unfinished building was described as a “chronic eyesore” by Kew’s director in his plea for further funds, and it would take another 18 years to see the full thing finished, by which time it had outlived two directors and its architect – 40 years after Burton had drawn up the designs. Compared with the startling futurism of his Palm House, an ethereal soap bubble formed from great sheets of curved glass, the train-shed bulk of the Temperate House was deemed to be rather prosaic.For the modern visitor, the protracted process brings added interest. The sluggish pace of the whole endeavour allows you to see the changing fashions of the day, with the latest trends embodied in its different wings. The acanthus leaf column capitals of the early phase give way to a simpler, stripped-back structure in the southern pavilion, while floral motifs on the wrought-iron trusses in the main house are later exchanged for plain circles and triangles. Windows operated with rack and pinion gears shaped like pterodactyl wings in the north pavilion become simpler elbow mechanisms in the south. What isn’t visible is the fact that in Burton’s day, the whole thing was glazed in green glass, thought by the Victorians to prevent scorching from the sun, while the ironwork, far from always being pristine white, has ranged from pale blue to dark green and brown.The renovations have opened up hundreds of clerestory windows that had been fixed shut in the 1970s, and installed lower-level apron vents, providing better cross-ventilation and air movement that will help the tree trunks to toughen up. Heating has been added in a new sunken trench, creating a more even atmosphere and allowing Kew to grow a broader range of plants. “Before, only the strong survived,” says Redwood.Wider central pathways allow access for cherrypickers, and a large crossing in the middle has clearly been sized with weddings and corporate event hire in mind – for which new lighting has been installed overhead and in the flowerbeds.

They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonIn 1943, three ordinary-looking US cities were constructed at record speed – but left off all maps. They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonSomething strange happened in the US state of Tennessee in 1943. Thousands of young workers poured into a 59,000-acre site about 25 miles west of Knoxville. Vast quantities of materials followed, never to re-emerge. Houses and other facilities were built with record speed. Yet officially Oak Ridge did not exist during the war and could not be found on any map.What was going on there? Very few people knew at the time, even among the residents. The answer was that this was the starting block in a race against Adolf Hitler to build the atom bomb. Oak Ridge was one of three “secret cities” of the Manhattan Project, along with Los Alamos in New Mexico and HanfordRichland in Washington state.More than 125,000 scientists, technicians and support staff occupied the three cities by the end of the war. There is a photo of a Santa Claus being frisked at the gates of Oak Ridge and a local newsletter stamped “restricted”. Anyone aged 12 or over had to wear an ID badge. The use of words such as “atomic” or “uranium” was taboo lest it tip off the enemy.Yet some social aspects were all too familiar: even these planned communities, which tried to offer residents an idyllic lifestyle and would influence postwar urban construction and design in America, replicated the racial segregation of the era.“At first glance they seem like very normal American communities,” says Martin Moeller, senior curator of the Secret Cities: The Architecture and Planning of the Manhattan Project exhibition, which opens on Thursday at the National Building Museum in Washington. “But then before long you start to see things that are strange in a variety of ways, sometimes humorous.”He offers examples: “Driving by the main hotel in Oak Ridge and seeing that the bar and lounge there is called the reactor room. Starting to see these nuclear symbols on seemingly random buildings around the place but also coming to understand that these were not just typical communities that grew up in a haphazard fashion, that there was a hand of design there even at the beginning of their existence.”It was late 1942, less than a year after the US had entered the second world war, when the US Army Corps of Engineers quietly began acquiring vast tracts of land in remote areas of three states. The few residents of these areas were summarily evicted and their houses demolished.Soon thousands of young workers arrived from far and wide, initially occupying tents and other makeshift shelters within the newly designated military reservations. Shielded from public view by natural barriers and security fences, the workers quickly erected hundreds of buildings, ranging from prefabricated houses to industrial structures of unprecedented scale.The goal was singular. Aware that the Nazis were pursuing nuclear weapons – though they were not as far along as thought at the time – the US would invest unfathomable money and manpower to get there first. The cause could scarcely have been more urgent.“Despite that, in building these communities, it was considered important to create housing in environments that were comfortable for the people who would be working for the scientists and engineers who would be doing this important work,” explains Moeller, who first visited Oak Ridge three decades ago when his future father-in-law was a nuclear physicist with the national laboratory there.“There was agreement that they needed to feel at home. They needed to have a community that felt ‘normal’. And so during this time of national emergency, the US government built single family houses in what we would now consider typical suburban neighborhoods, instead of just jamming all of these people into dormitories and barracks as I would think almost any other country in the world would have done for time. That to me, in of itself, is extraordinary.”He adds: “These cities really were proving grounds for emerging ideas about town planning architecture and construction. In many cases they were continuing movements that were already in existence.”Built from scratch in half a year to produce fuel for atomic bombs, Oak Ridge was initially conceived as a town for 13,000 people but grew to 75,000 by the end of the war, the biggest of the secret cities. The housing was designed by Skidmore, Owings \u0026amp Merrill (SOM), now one of the biggest and most influential architecture firms in the world. And yet while Oak Ridge seemed to exist in a bubble, it was also very much of its time.Moeller continues: “Although these cities were very much conceived as forward-looking communities – they really wanted places that were idyllic in many ways, great places to raise families – nonetheless segregation was designed in from the start. It was just considered to be a given by all parties concerned. There were racial issues that were baked into these communities.”SOM’s initial plan called for a “negro village” at the eastern end of town, furthest from the work sites, which was to include housing similar to that provided for white residents. But as Oak Ridge grew quicker than expected, those plans were abandoned and most African American residents were relegated to “hutments”: rudimentary plywood structures barely superior to tents.They were frigid in the winter – heated with crude stoves – and sweltering in the summer and offered little privacy. They lacked internal plumbing so residents had to use collective toilet facilities. Even married couples were not allowed to live together in the hutment camps. And residents were routinely subjected to more surveillance from the security authorities than those living in the more permanent neighbourhoods.By the end of the war, most of the white families had been moved out of the hutments and, as the population was then shrinking, went into more permanent housing. But many of the African American families continued to live in the basic dwellings until the early 1950s. There would be a twist, however. Moeller says: “In the postwar period, Oak Ridge, having now been settled as a place full of academics and very well-educated people otherwise, was one of the leaders in the desegregation movement in the south. In fact, two of the first public schools in the south to be desegregated were in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge even threatened to secede from Tennessee in order to desegregate. So there was a relatively quick turnaround.”When the US dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, killing tens of thousands of people to force an end to the war, the city’s secret was out. Many residents celebrated. One local newspaper declared: “Atomic super-bomb, made at Oak Ridge, strikes Japan.” Another said: “Oak Ridge Attacks Japanese ... Workers thrill as atomic bomb secret breaks press and radio stories describe ‘fantastically powerful’ weapon expected to save many lives.”All three cities remained part of the military industrial complex, continuing to work on nuclear weapons during the cold war as well as broader scientific research today Oak Ridge is heavily involved in renewable energy. The unique subcultures that grew during their early years of isolation also survive. Moeller observes: “These people really in many ways had to commit to create their own culture and interestingly, even to this day, some of the little theatre companies and musical troupes that were formed during world war two still exist and still operate as community cultural organisations in theses cities.”That includes “atomic culture”, or, to put it another way, gallows humour. At one of the most popular lunch spots in Oak Ridge, there are pictures of mushroom clouds on the wall. The logo of Richland high school contains a mushroom cloud. “There are pictures of atomic symbols and so on and I hasten to point out that that’s not because the residents of these communities are callous.“They realise the seriousness of the work that was done in those places during the war and afterwards during the cold war. But it’s kind of like doctors’ humour in emergency rooms. They’re somewhat notorious for being irreverent in their humor about medical conditions. It’s how they deal with the seriousness of what they do.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a9f0c34a41fb8ddb8b40057ab68bcb4687edf0/0_91_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b33638381ee5ec41ccc4970759f8b8","title":"harry meghan pay as you go wedding commoners royal wedding","story":"Oh, how the monarchy is modernising! Look at lovely, jokey Harry with his openness about mental health and his glowing fiancee, who astonishingly has had a life, is not a dumb blonde and says things about female independence. Oh, how they have moved on, this new generation of royals. They are just like us, after all.Except they are not. So the latest news about the commoners invited to the royal wedding is really stunning in its declaration of who’s who and what’s what. Kensington Palace (probably using the retch-inducing phrase “reach out”) announced earlier this year that Meghan and Harry were going “to allow members of the public to join in their celebration”. Very special people representing “youth” and “ersity” and – whisper it quietly – poor people would be allowed inside the perimeter of Windsor Castle. This is not just a wedding, remember, this is an attempt to build a bridge between high society and well … society.Twelve-hundred hand-picked “ordinary” people, many from charities that the royals support, will be let into the castle’s grounds. They will be there for hours and hours, and yet, it seems, they will not get so much as a vol-au-vent. Those who work with deprived and alienated people have been advised in letters from lord lieutenants “to bring a picnic lunch as it will not be possible to buy food and drink on site”. What? What kind of invite is that?It’s one that absolutely makes clear what is happening. That’s what. It never had anything to do with altruism. These ordinary people will effectively be extras for the TV coverage. They’ll make up a crowd that will be beamed around the world. The royals’ net wealth is estimated at around £400m – but now let us bow down before our rulers and hope that a garage sandwich will tide us over. Oh, I know it is not a good time to be a republican but quite honestly it never is. No one can begrudge the Queen, no one can’t admire the loveliness of Meghan, and on it goes. Only that kind of thinking is how this fountainhead of inequality is always made palatable.I once refused to go to a wedding because there was a pay bar as well as one of those irritating wedding lists. So I am not a great one for a pay-as-you-go celebrations. I can’t see it as anything other than meanness. Have a party or don’t. These occasions are actually very boring for spectators: hours of waiting around for a fleeting glimpse of a gloved hand as it speeds past. I was in the cathedral for Diana’s funeral, and on the way there we went past the crowds who had been sleeping in the street overnight. Weirdly, I was at Windsor for Harry’s father’s “low-key” wedding to Camilla, hoping, I suppose, for the ghost of Diana to appear. The crowds were quite sparse but had their flags to wave. What makes people wait for hours to do this, I remember asking a bored policeman. “We call them cat-stranglers,” he said. I didn’t know what that meant. “Women so mad they strangle their own cats,” he informed me.Now, though, the royalist media will go into overdrive and there will be a lot of reverential dross about protocol and etiquette. Debrett’s advises at least six canapes per guest before a wedding lunch. Harry and Meghan’s 600 actual guests will get the works, but the people chosen because they serve the most vulnerable in their communities will be left milling about for hours and are now Googling Windsor for the nearest supermarkets.As a metaphor for inclusivity royal-style, though, it’s all perfect, isn’t it? Do please come and gawp and cheer, but bring your own sandwiches. The meanness of the super-rich is truly something to behold. Twenty-one-year-old Saeed Atcha told the  that the news made him wonder if he should go to a nearby McDonald’s, but he wasn’t sure whether he’d be allowed to bring in a filet meal. He set up a magazine in Bolton after the 2011 riots and talked of the bemusement of some of the disadvantaged people his charity helps that the royals will scarcely offer invitees a drink. “It’s unfathomable,” he said. Not really, it’s the monarchy. Same as it ever was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8fde6c6f15b7f616ce3c909e9bf17117d5dd03c/0_272_2260_1356/master/2260.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a0f05fe8a416eb1b0f759827a97634","title":"chris grayling car roadworks pavements transport congestion","story":"It seems ironic that the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, should usher in National Walking Month by announcing plans to dig up more pavements, to spare motorists the inconvenience of roadworks.His idea is that cables and services should be laid under pavements and verges to cut congestion and reduce potholes. Even when pavement is only being dug up when there’s another one on the other side of the road to use, as the Department for Transport (DfT) is proposing, the plan to free up road space by making the walking environment more difficult to navigate could have the opposite effect, by reducing non-driving options.In a week when the UK has been identified as among the worst countries in Europe for asthma death rates, and a who’s who of British cities with toxic air has been published, this would be a disastrous result. Footage taken by the former doctor and disability activist Amit Patel demonstrates that if you’re blind, a blocked pavement is a blocked pavement – even if it’s obstructed only on one side of the road. This whole idea seems yet another case of the do-nothing-to-upset -drivers attitude that does so much to hinder non-motorised transport in this country.Meanwhile, DfT consideration of a new law against pavement parking is a step in the right direction for people who would like to walk.Grayling himself seems more car-focused, however. It was only last year he said cyclists weren’t real road users, after “dooring” one while getting out of a car outside Parliament. This week he described the pothole problem as one he has noticed while “driving around”. Toyota GB PLC, whose headquarters are in Grayling’s constituency, sponsored his constituency office from 2002 to 2009, and then again from 2011 to 2016, latterly to the tune of £6,000 per year. He has also been an honorary RAC member since 2013, valued at £1,600 per year. These donations are logged in his register of interests and there’s no suggestion of any wrongdoing. But Grayling seems to be a car guy.Unfortunately, though nearly all of us use pavements, few of us identify ourselves as “pedestrians” in the same way that cyclists and drivers identify themselves with their means of transport, which means our voice is often lost in the clamour of demands on our crowded streets.Living Streets, the national walking charity, raises concerns about the impact of roadworks on elderly pedestrians, pointing out that disabled and elderly people are less likely to own cars, leaving them with no way to get around in the absence of safe, obstacle-free pavements. Dig up the pavements and you introduce detours, often off raised kerbs, into the road. The scope for trips and falls is far increased and the likelihood that someone using a wheelchair or with impaired vision can still safely navigate those detours is reduced.I recently toured east London’s Stratford town centre, undergoing pedestrian- and cycle-friendly improvements, to see for myself the impact of roadworks on vulnerable road users. With me was Mike Barratt, Transport for London’s development impact assessment lead. He identified problems including fencing over crossing buttons ,barriers funnelling cyclists and pedestrians together, and flooded crossing points, and asked contractors to address these. Would all councils have the diligence, or the resources, to do this?Potholes are a real issue, but their cause is arguably chronic underinvestment, exacerbated by utility companies badly patching repairs. Who’s to say the same contractors won’t do the same on pavements?We know what causes congestion: too many cars on the road. They are the least efficient way of moving people around, and they’re killing us via pollution. Conversely, we know the way to cut congestion – and it’s to make cycling, walking and public transport easier. Whatever Chris Grayling says, we, the pedestrians, should remember that.• Laura Laker is a freelance writer for the , covering the environment and cycling"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4f86045444b9a931605ad6bc0fd8fbfbf59304/0_373_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84ae0ad318f82fdbad7ab912f90907bb","title":"email response to emails","story":"There are scores of messages in my inbox to which I have every intention of replying and yet that continue, rather glumly, to sit there. Until recently, this would have struck me as bad form: allowing days, and occasionally weeks, to go by before engaging with non-urgent requests. Recently, however, I’ve noticed a new etiquette: what feels to me like a free pass to put emails on ice until you break the seal and begin the exchange.I raise this because it seems to me as if we’re in another transitional moment, a correction to the first two decades of email enslavement and a move towards a slightly more manageable protocol. Where once a same-day reply seemed not just ideal but mandatory, now a slow response indicates freedom of mind and a robust push back against the tyranny of one’s inbox. Perhaps I’m deluded, but all the handwringing over whether technology takes away from our ability to be human is countered by the fact that it brings more awareness to the parts that are left.Or at least, that is the story we can tell ourselves. The best thing about the new rules of engagement, if that’s what they are, is the overwhelming sense of self-righteousness they confer. It’s not that I can’t be bothered to reply or am trying to avoid you it’s that I have liberated myself from the yoke of technology. My lassitude, rather than a sign of organisational failure, is in fact an ideological victory.There are limits to how far one can take this. In the case of email, I’ve noticed, the crucial thing is not to initiate a too-speedy response, since the speed of reply sets the pace of discussion. Once an exchange is under way, you’re committed and it feels very rude to go dark for a few days if a quicker rate has already been established. And, of course, a too fanatical non-engagement with technology puts you in danger of becoming the person who inconveniences everyone else so you can lovingly curate your self-image.There are practical downsides too. I recently found myself in LA, in a 300-year-old taxi cab driven by a man of equal vintage, who slammed to a halt to check his satnav on a busy two-lane highway. I sat in the back, considering the possibility I was about to orphan my children because I got on my high horse about Uber. (On the way home, I tried to re-download Uber but it wanted Touch ID, which I couldn’t get to work, and for several moments I stood there dithering in a car park like someone teleported in from the 80s.)As technology extends its reach, so we find new ways to avoid it. These days, I make sure all my WhatsApp messages come up as notifications on my phone, so I can read them without activating the app, alerting the sender to the fact I have seen them. And so on and so on. I’m not out having a life with the tiny bit of time these strategies free up, but the dream is that I may occasionally look up from my phone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f14ed258db25de842b9d2ed402295d6b065dde/0_366_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1507221738ca64c7299650ce9241a3a","title":"fat shaming children school obesity eating disorders","story":"In an attempt to fight obesity, the government could force schools across England to weigh and measure their students. Under a suggested policy from No 10, children would jump on the scales and have their middles taped once a year. If they qualified as overweight, they’d be subjected to extra gym classes and a school-imposed programme of weight loss.Schools could be judged on their ability to help students shed pounds, creating some sort of perverse competition based on the shrinking waistlines of pupils. A hierarchy of schools based on shaming pupils into losing weight is alarming and bizarre. Do they get extra funding if they make the kid cry? A bonus for every child who develops an eating disorder after having to stand on the scales in front of friends? A gold star for pushing students under their care into a lifetime of yo-yo dieting?This is precisely the wrong way to go about combating the country’s supposed weight problem. It is a terrible, ill-advised, short-sighted idea – and one that could be quite dangerous. One in five kids are obese by the end of primary school, which is alarming – but to shame them into weight loss simply teaches them to equate their worth with a number on a scale, and sets them up for a lifetime of thinking their size is some sort of indication of who they are.We cannot, and should not, be teaching teenagers that their bodies are shameful – and don’t be mistaken, that would be the inevitable result of a schoolyard weighing programme. Children and teenagers are fragile enough already, without the humiliation of having to disclose their weight to someone at school – or worse, be subjected to a special programme none of their friends are doing. Can you imagine the taunts?Society cannot, and should not, humiliate a person into weight loss this much we should know by now. Obesity is incredibly complex, and often the result of inequality, lack of education and emotional distress. Chastising someone for being overweight – a child already vulnerable to playground bullying based on appearance – is not going to inspire them to adopt a healthier lifestyle. It’s more likely push them to pick up another packet of chips, or begin to deny themselves food.Weighing kids publicly poses a very real risk to people who may be vulnerable to eating disorders already. The idea of having to step on a set of scales at school makes me – as someone who had anorexia as a teenager – feel physically ill. It would have sent me reeling into an even worse bout of starvation. With children as young as six developing eating disorders, and more teenagers than ever admitted to hospital, we cannot be preaching that weight is what matters here.The only way we are going to make any progress solving the obesity and anorexia epidemics in the UK is to address our dangerously fraught relationship with food, eating and body image. The obvious service a school can provide is education, often the thing lacking when a person is under- or overweight. Schools should be teaching kids about nutrition and exercise, yes, but they should also be encouraging a healthy, functional attitude to food that includes separating a person’s worth from their weight on a scale. They shouldn’t be preaching calories and kilos they should be teaching children and teenagers to feel happy, strong and informed enough to live as healthy a life as possible.That means eating for their physical and psychological wellbeing it means doing physical activity they enjoy it means knowing what confidence in their bodies feels like. Exercise shouldn’t be doled out as a punishment for exceeding a certain number on a scale – it should be an essential, hopefully joyous and fulfilling part of someone’s day. It is not a school’s place to scold a child into weight loss or force them to run off extra weight in the gym. How will that encourage children to exercise as they become adults?Teaching kids to shrink themselves on the command of their school, especially based on some sort of ranking system, is perverse. If children need to lose weight, they have to come to that decision on their own, with the aid of helpful, science-based, trauma-informed, compassionately shared information, from parents and teachers.• Kate Leaver is a freelance journalist and author of The Friendship Cure"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92aa15feb7a8626e72c0b2207f0de8a50b74ea2/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e1663421b3ba7accda31ea6989bfb4","title":"quakers dropping god","story":"I am not a Quaker or religious, but I have been to Quaker meetings, usually marriages or funerals, and found them deeply moving. The absence of ritual, the emphasis on silence and thought and the witness of “friends” seemed starkly modernist. Meeting houses can be beautiful spaces. The loveliest I know dates from 1700 and is lost in deep woods near Meifod, Powys. It is a place of the purest serenity, miles from any road and with only birdsong to blend with inner reflection.What these words mean is now the subject of intense debate. What are these spirits in which these people profess to believe, and how might they be appeased? It is clear that most people no longer see them as residing in a church. Yet many still turn to churches in emergencies or times of trouble, when the world seems otherwise inexplicable. This was noted after the high-profile deaths of Princess Diana and Jade Goody. As the sociologist Grace Davie put it in her book Religion in Britain, the church is a sort of public utility, a fire station or pop-up A\u0026ampE unit.To Davie, many of these people are declaring a “vicarious religion”, or what she calls “believing not belonging”. They do not like a church’s faux collegiality, the hand-shaking, happy-clapping and sense of entrapment. They do not really seek God, rather a mental and physical space to sort out their thoughts, somewhere to find “anonymity, the option to come and go without explanation or greeting … to move from one stage of commitment to another”.This is taken to explain the continuing success of cathedrals, where attendances have risen while those in churches has fallen. It seems cathedrals meet a quasi-secular searching for solitude and inner peace, stimulated by great architecture and music. Above all, they offer anonymity. A character in last week’s The Archers sought solace in fictional “Felpersham” cathedral, to find “somewhere she could be anonymous”. A latest British Journal of General Practice survey suggests doctors are increasingly being used as “new clergy” by people who are not ill but seeking something to “give meaning and purpose to life”. It would take a brave GP to prescribe a dose of matins once a day. But something “spiritual” is needed.The boom in psychotherapy is no secret. As religion declines, so emerges a craving for therapy. The 12-step movement of alcoholics and narcotics “anonymous” has much in common with Quakerism, notably the emphasis on non-authoritarian fellowship. Beyond lie the wilder shores of mindfulness, meditation, happiness courses and “holistic spirituality”. All this suggests that the purely physical aspects of our being do not always meet the needs of a fully rounded person.The Quakers have always been remarkable. They were a disruptive force in 17th-century religion. They thrived through being persecuted for denying allegiance to the Church of England. Their exclusion bred Britain’s first industrialists, bankers and confectioners, not to mention the famous Quaker Oats. Quakerism has declined of late, perhaps because there is no fortune in rebelling against any church. You can find “friends” on the web and introspection on the NHS.If Quakers now find God “uncomfortable” I can hear cries from pulpits that discomfort is the point of Christianity. Comfort is in the afterlife, and marketing it has been the church’s unique selling proposition since Luther and papal indulgences. To Luther it was a con. What is not a con is humanity’s quest for comfort in the here and now, for therapy in the widest sense of the word.The sublimity of Dolobran meeting house and the exhilaration of Ely cathedral offer more than an emotional A\u0026ampE unit. They offer places so uplifting that anyone can find it in themselves to sit, think, clear their heads and order their thoughts. There is no need for gods or religion to rest and be refreshed.To that, Quakerism has added the experience of standing up and expressing doubts, fears and joys amid a company of “friends”, who respond only with their private silence. The therapy is that of shared experience. Clear God from the room, and the Quakers are indeed on to something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c452feca4f7059ad0640f78792939c540fc61a6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b35fa6803da76496c7d51a0c00604c14","title":"the best wide leg trousers for all ages in pictures","story":"A hint of shaping – whether it’s with a silk shirt or a jumper loosely tucked in at the front – will stop trousers looking too voluminous"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5020f6bd8514329b93d6d348365d451db57ce89/1090_151_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c3c33f6babcd0d62f78c9c6590e1ace","title":"theres this idea that mothers are completely selfless diablo cody on tully and the juno backlash","story":"The Oscar-winning writer’s new film is about an exhausted mother slowly unravelling. She talks about the impact of motherhood, facing middle-age – and what she’d now change about JunoMotherhood isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Or at least it isn’t black and white, more of a stretched, washed-out, flesh-coloured maternity-bra shade inbetween, according to screenwriter Diablo Cody’s new film Tully. A decade on from her Academy Award-winning teen pregnancy rom-com Juno, Cody has created another lead who is expecting, this time turning Charlize Theron into baggy-eyed mum Marlo, who is one frozen pizza dinner away from the edge. She shouts. She accidentally drops an iPhone on her baby’s head. She slumps in front of her children, post-birth belly hanging out, much to their horror. Deflated, running on empty, she resembles a whoopee cushion being sat on in slow motion. Parenting has never looked so relatable.Cody, 39, says she is a different Diablo from the one who sashayed down the 2008 Oscars red carpet in head-to-toe leopard print to collect her award for Juno’s screenplay. She wrote the rom-com in a month while sitting in Starbucks, and it took her from part-time stripper-blogger to star overnight. Her projects since Juno haven’t quite matched that film’s pop culture-puncturing potential: Megan Fox horror dud Jennifer’s Body a Spielberg-produced TV series, United States of Tara, which lasted three seasons underrated rock comedy Ricki and the Flash brilliant but cancelled Amazon Prime series One Mississippi, which she co-created with standup Tig Notaro. But one aspect that has remained constant is her focus on creating female characters that defy the ordinary. Meryl Streep’s ageing rocker in 2015’s Ricki and the Flash, based on Cody’s mother-in-law, was particularly important – “a woman who had chosen to pursue her passion at the expense of her children, and she was viewed as a monster because of that,” she says. “We’re surrounded by men who have made that choice and are not demonised in the same way.”Tully is the third film in her trilogy with Jason Reitman, and the second with Theron after Young Adult, and again offers a view on the female experience that Cody rarely sees onscreen. And so there are money issues, a sexless marriage with a fairly useless husband, the exasperation at not knowing how to care for a young son with undiagnosed special needs. Sensing her desperation, Marlo’s brother buys the baby shower gift that every strained mother dreams of: help. Tully is a night nanny who breezily glides in, all toned abs and tanned limbs, to do the twilight shift so Marlo can rest. She’s a Manic Pixie Dream Girl version of Maria von Trapp, but also a device to help Marlo question what parts of herself have been lost under the tummy-huggers.Cody can relate. After having kids, she says, the question of “How do you access the person that you once were?” is something she grapples with. “I feel like a completely different human being on a cellular level since having children.” Not just through a loss of identity – in the film, Marlo is also suffering from postnatal depression, which Cody says there’s still a stigma around. She doesn’t say whether she had post-natal depression herself but does confirm she felt “that emptiness” for a while. “We’re told that we should feel completely blissed out after we have a baby, and that’s not always how women feel. It comes down to this idea that mothers are supposed to be completely selfless and if you’re indulging feelings of sadness or depression, that could be perceived by other people as selfish.”Tully isn’t just about parenting, however: “It’s about the great and intense transformation of middle age. It’s waking up and going: ‘Oh my God, I’m 40 – what happened?’” Is she feeling apprehensive about that coming milestone? “Yeah, and it’s strange. For years I’ve been regarded as ‘a young screenwriter’, or someone who has achieved a lot for her age. But no one’s going to give you a cookie for achieving something at 40. At this point, the pressure’s on me to perform and to sustain that. And also, we all know how older women are regarded, particularly in Hollywood. So it’s a little scary to think: ‘Oh, I will be discarded – that’s going to happen.’”Talking to Cody about these pressures, you wonder why she hasn’t been much involved in the wider public conversation about women in Hollywood that has occurred in the past year. Reading old interviews with her, Cody was outspoken and outraged, but recently her voice has been eerily absent she quit Twitter in 2015 and hasn’t considered rejoining. “I’ve been expressing my viewpoint in my art for more than a decade now, so everybody knows that I’m a feminist,” she says. “I don’t think my voice would’ve been valuable in that conversation because, honestly, I don’t think Twitter is desperate for another quirky white woman spouting her opinion. Let’s hear from voices we don’t hear from.”Still, she is encouraged by the Time’s Up movement, even if she initially doubted its staying power. “I’m such a cynic that, when it first started happening, I was on a group text with a lot of my girlfriends, and they were all so excited and I was like: ‘This won’t last. Men in power are going to shut this down so fast.’ And then it didn’t, it just grew and grew. So I’m glad that I was proven wrong.”Cody says she is “heartened” too by the progress that Hollywood is making with “the types of roles that are being written for women. When I started out, a TV show or a film about a difficult woman was a hard sell, and now it’s something that people are soliciting from me.” But she finds it frustrating that women aren’t allowed to fail in the same way as men. “It drives me crazy that if a woman directs a movie and it doesn’t perform, people say: ‘Oh, they shouldn’t have let a woman direct it.’” . Cody’s own directorial debut, the 2013 comedy drama Paradise, was made while she was pregnant, and was subsequently panned by critics. “If a man directs a movie and it flops, there’s literally no discussion of the director’s gender,” she adds. “As a woman in a field where women are underrepresented, you often feel like you are representing women, and that’s ridiculous.”With Tully, Cody does seem to have come full circle since Juno. Knowing what she knows now about childbirth, would she have done anything about her first film differently? “In terms of pregnancy, no,” she says. “But I don’t feel I was clear enough in terms of why Juno chose to not have an abortion. It was simply because she did not want to.”The film was criticised by some for portraying abortion in a “negative” light. “It was not about any type of feeling that abortion was wrong – I’m pro-choice,” Cody says. “So for it to be interpreted as an anti-choice movie, that’s upsetting to me.”The Juno backlash is one reason that she has become “more private”. She refuses to self-censor – “it hasn’t affected my writing” – but says: “It’s certainly affected the way that I talk to people about the projects. I’ve become very boring because I want to protect myself and my children. I would like to just keep a low profile and continue to work, and I’ve had to really stay under the radar in order to accomplish that.”It’s depressing that a forthright person such as Cody has been forced to retreat from the public eye. But, like Marlo, she sees a “joy” in embracing a life more ordinary. “I take great pride in my boring life, because it’s not easy for me to be sedate. I’m a naturally curious, impulsive, self-destructive person. And I’ve had to put all that aside as a mum. I’m proud of that because it’s required a lot of discipline.”• Tully is released on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfbf7497e5eaa571e3ea0944faee623fa780cf7/0_90_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c50c5fb30a847e95952e2ff54804ff","title":"atletico madrid arsenal europa league semi final match report","story":"For Arsène Wenger, there will be no happy ending. “Rumbo hacia Lyon,” (road to Lyon) read the huge banner unfurled by the most boisterous section of Atlético Madrid supporters before this victory. Diego Simeone’s team are, as promised, on their way to the Europa League final and whatever tributes come for Wenger over the next 10 days – the promise of a statue, perhaps, or even a stand named in his honour at the Emirates – it will not be how he wanted the story to finish.All that is left now is Sunday’s home game against Burnley, followed by the trips to Leicester and Huddersfield, and perhaps it is a fitting end to a season of drift. Arsenal came up short, as they often do against elite teams, and when they needed something special in the second half, losing to Diego Costa’s goal, they did not have the personnel to deliver it. Arsenal barely summoned a chance and the late onslaught that might have been anticipated never really materialised. There was only one goal in it – yet Arsenal were obliging opponents for a team with Atlético’s defensive expertise.This was Atlético’s 12th successive clean sheet at this stadium – an incredible run that goes back to 20 January and covers 1,097 minutes in play – and that parsimonious defending was the difference over the two legs. Atlético were brilliantly efficient at the back whereas it is more than 10 years since the same could be said of Wenger’s teams. He has never won a European trophy and, yes, it would have been a lovely way to go out after 22 years as Arsenal’s manager. Atlético, however, give the impression that fairytale endings are just that – for fairytales.On top of everything else, Arsenal also lost Laurent Koscielny to a ruptured achilles tendon, an injury that will have ramifications for France. Koscielny, who has been nursing a long-standing problem, went down in such a way the seriousness of the injury immediately became apparent.He pounded the turf in pain and frustration and his reaction was of a man who must have known straight away what it meant for his hopes of playing in the World Cup. Koscielny was supposed to retire after this summer’s tournament instead, he will not be involved with Didier Deschamps’s team in Russia.David Ospina Did not spread confidence. Involved in a few mix-ups. Poor kicking. Saved from Torres late on. 6Héctor Bellerín Caught on wrong side and out-muscled for Costa’s goal. Passed up promising situations on counter. 5Shkodran Mustafi Much-maligned defender stood up to Costa. Made a host of important tackles and interceptions. 7Laurent Koscielny Victim of early achilles horror, when he slipped and felt his leg buckle. Taken off on a stretcher. NANacho Monreal Willing attacking outlet, pressed high, made runs. Struggled badly for end product. 5Aaron Ramsey Chance in front of goal on 52 minutes – could not muster power. Worked to stretch Atlético. 6Granit Xhaka Nobody on the field saw more of the ball. Generally sound with it. Went close with a long-range shot. 6Jack Wilshere Tidy in possession, trademark quick feet, tried to drive the team. Walked off slowly when subbed. 6Mesut Özil Looked smooth, as usual, but flicks did not always come off. Lacked killer touch. 5Alexandre Lacazette In-form striker was suffocated. One flicker in area on 28 minutes but touch heavy. 5Danny Welbeck Preferred to Mkhitaryan because of his work rate, he could not make anything happen. 5Ratings by David HytnerHypothetical now, but perhaps Arsenal might have coped better with Costa and Antoine Griezmann if their captain had lasted longer than seven minutes. Then again, Koscielny was badly at fault for Griezmann’s goal in the first leg. Griezmann had another fine game and when the two Atlético forwards combined at the end of the first half, in the time added on for Koscielny’s treatment, it led to the game’s decisive moment.The goal showed the qualities of both players. Griezmann’s pass was beautifully weighted and once Costa had got behind Héctor Bellerín it was always going to be difficult for the Arsenal right-back to make up for his positional error. Bellerín might have been faster but Costa was stronger, shielding the ball with his body while expertly holding off his opponent. David Ospina, who had endured a nervous opening 45 minutes, advanced from his line and Costa swept the ball past Arsenal’s goalkeeper with a confident left-foot finish.Until the point the Arsenal supporters, positioned in the most vertiginous levels of this sweeping new-build stadium, must have been pleasantly surprised by the way their team had set about the game.All the same, Wenger’s men had a lot of the ball without doing a great deal with it. Mesut Özil, for instance, was prominently involved without being able to pick out a killer pass. Atlético have conceded only 18 goals in 35 La Liga appearances this season and Arsenal needed more from their attacking players. Danny Welbeck and Alexandre Lacazette were disappointing.In the second half Arsenal were attacking the end where their supporters were gathered and there were some encouraging moments early on. Granit Xhaka’s low shot brought the first noteworthy save from Jan Oblak and there were even a few moments of carelessness from the home team’s defenders.Bellerín’s surging runs from right-back were another feature and midway through the second half Wenger brought on Henrikh Mkhitaryan to increase his team’s attacking threat at the expense of Jack Wilshere.Arsenal still found it difficult to get behind Atlético’s expertly organised defence. Mkhitaryan put one shot over the crossbar and the referee, Gianluca Rocchi, was too lenient on the sporadic occasions when Wenger’s team found themselves in encouraging positions and Simeone’s players – streetwise, to the end – gave away deliberate free-kicks.Arsenal seemed to lose belief in the final exchanges and that, perhaps, was the most disappointing part. There was no burst of late pressure, no moving a defender into attack, no gambling – and, more than anything, no spark. The final whistle sounded and Wenger was quickly gone.Jan Oblak Had to push away one Xhaka shot but otherwise untroubled – a testament to Atlético’s defensive effort. 6Thomas Partey Immense physical presence, the midfielder showed discipline and class out of position at right-back. 7José Maria Giménez Made a series of clearances, good in the air. Helped to keep the door bolted. 8Diego Godín Yet again a rock at the heart of the defence. Always touch tight. Used all of his experience. 8Lucas Hernández Converted centre-back, he had nothing to worry about from either Özil or Welbeck. 7Koke Had more touches than anybody in red and white. Generally tidy. Emphasis on containment. 6Gabi Took no quarter in the challenge, spoiled, broke up play. Booked for cynical foul. 6Saúl Attritional rather than spectacular. Priority was to stop Arsenal counters. Booked for cynical foul. 6Vitolo Struggled to make an impression from the left. Guilty of some loose passing. 6Diego Costa Bristled with physical menace, defenders bounced off him. Took his goal with clinical cool. 8Antoine Griezmann Quickened the pulse when he found space. Lovely assist for Costa. Cute touches throughout. 8Ratings by David Hytner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d45258003eb6ce7ba9732accc8cc7f14e152a5/360_1704_4184_2509/master/4184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c86ae74ee3bfec8a7bd998962ded263","title":"jose mourinho managing expectations manchester united manager","story":"The Manchester United manager has consistently managed to win things – even when he does not have the best teamAccording to José Mourinho, it took him “20 years to become an overnight success”. Having spent a few days this week on the final part of my Uefa pro licence coaching course, I am beginning to appreciate what he meant when he said that. Hours in the classroom and on the pitch, as well as giving presentations to fellow students, has made me more appreciative of the hard work that goes into qualifying to be able to do a job that I don’t even know if I will one day be lucky enough to get.Studying also gives an insight into the commitment, passion and application which someone like Mourinho has had to put into football in order to achieve the level of success he has. In a week when the world has been praising the courageous and attacking football which has taken Liverpool to the Champions League final, I have to say that I have just as much admiration and respect for the Manchester United manager as I have for Jürgen Klopp.Mourinho brings his team to the Amex Stadium on Friday evening for a match which is significant for both sides as we aim to secure our Premier League status and United attempt to finish the season in second place, with the added incentive of preparing for an FA Cup final against Chelsea just a couple of weeks away. Mourinho has proved himself a master of winning games in cup competitions and it’s no wonder, given his pragmatic approach to preparing for every game in a specific way.There have been a few times this season when he has been hammered for playing so-called negative football – his tactics at Liverpool were a case in point – but criticising a coach for selecting a team and forming a gameplan to counter an opponent’s strengths is like using a mallet to crack an egg.Every coach will have his own beliefs about how the game should be played and that philosophy will be borne out by the way his team carry out instructions, but it is a very narrow mind which contests that one way is definitively better than another. Like everything else in the world, football undergoes cycles and you cannot tell me the high-scoring, attacking football of this season’s Champions League is not an antidote or a reaction to the more defensive and cautious football which had been prevalent in the past 10 years or so.The foundation for change in the game is a difference in style of coaches. Mourinho is unlike Pep Guardiola or Klopp in his philosophy, but his adaptability and core values are proven to achieve success against the very best.You may remember that it was Mourinho’s Real Madrid side who won La Liga in 2011-12 against arguably the greatest club side of all time in Guardiola’s Barcelona. Real did not beat or even challenge Barça at their own game because Mourinho believed he knew how to get the better of them and they achieved that courtesy of his forensic attention to detail in preparations for a match. The modus operandi is to ensure the players are ready for the battle with their direct opponent and that they are drilled to react to any scenario – from conceding a goal to finding your team reduced to 10 men.Players who have won major trophies in Mourinho teams, such as Frank Lampard at Chelsea or Internazionale’s Marco Materazzi, have spoken about his attention to detail and how that inspires confidence in his players and while Mourinho may have a mixed persona in public, one certainty is that the majority of his players love him and would run through brick walls for him.However, it’s not that simple. Arsène Wenger has correctly been praised for revolutionising English football in the late 90s with his introduction of sports science and diet changes, among other things, at Arsenal. It seems as if he could not or would not evolve with other changes in the game, though, and that’s where the chameleon-like Mourinho may have the edge as he has incorporated the best of the rest into the running of the teams he has managed and then added his skill-set to succeed.United have come up against a phenomenal Manchester City side who are very worthy champions this season, but in the same time frame as Guardiola has been manager at the Etihad Stadium, Mourinho has won the Europa League and League Cup, and could still add an FA Cup.It is true that Guardiola’s team and the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson have set a high bar for him but ask fans if they prefer winning to losing and I know the answer you will get.As an aspiring coach I have a firm handle on how I want my team to play and I admire and wonder at the way the likes of Guardiola, Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino have gone about their work. At the same time, I look at Mourinho and what he has won in his career by adopting a less evangelical approach to the game we all love. He has still managed to achieve great success regardless.Howard Wilkinson has been one of our tutors on the pro licence course and he is adamant that you have to survive your first 70 games as a manager if you are to have any chance of succeeding long term.Should I get the opportunity to coach one game, never mind 70, then I would be looking to combine the beautiful with the practical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd3f0d3a96d2e372503e3e7a54e397c1a8244e40/0_171_4731_2839/master/4731.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85ec1db7b99bd659ef24b3303b02345e","title":"viagogo tickets pay extra fees hidden","story":"I bought two tickets from Viagogo displayed at €32 each.After our payment had been processed, a pop-up informed us we had been charged a €16 booking fee, a handling fee and VAT on top of the displayed price.

The windowless dressing room in one of Seoul’s major TV studios isn’t much bigger than a double bedroom, but is crowded with 11 staff and the seven members of K-pop group Monsta X, who are promoting their new single: the seductive, dramatic Jealousy. Vocalists Shownu, Kihyun, Minhyuk, Hyungwon and Wonho, and rappers Jooheon and I.M, are now seasoned “idols”, as K-pop stars are called, and oblivious to this lack of space. Within a culture of seniority, a dressing room is earned until recently, they were in a communal room with other young teams (known as “rookies”) with flimsy iders for privacy.Wonho, 25, whose infectious laugh belies a thoughtful intensity, is practising dance moves while the softly spoken 25-year-old Shownu, Monsta X’s team leader, whose duty is to “guide them in the right direction and keep them sharp”, asks if we have eaten. Red-haired Kihyun, 24, brings over iced Americano. They are running on zero sleep from a trip to the south-east city of Ulsan the day before, where they performed in a rainstorm on a TV show. Fan footage shows Kihyun falling over, but he shrugs it off. “From our debut, we’ve experienced stuff like this. I knew I was going to slip. In my head it’s: ‘Choreography! Choreography!’ so I go into the next move. It’s not something to be embarrassed about.”Ms Suh and Ms Shim, executive directors at Monsta X’s agency, Starship, put idol training – when talent is honed and new skills developed – at five to seven years. The aim for these putative stars is to be put alongside others in a manufactured band, and then “debuted” as a finished product Monsta X were formed in 2015 after prospective members were whittled down on a reality show called No.Mercy. “Korean entertainment is one of the hardest jobs out there,” say Suh and Shim. “Trainees are cast from the street and auditions, and learn there are guidelines, and things they need to give up. Everyone is running towards the same goal: debuting.” No trainee is guaranteed a debut and Shownu switched agencies (“It was slightly painful”) to give himself the best chance of being picked for a group.Each agency sets its own rules, but mobile phones or romantic relationships are forbidden as standard Monsta X say they relinquished their phones as trainees and for nearly two years after their debut. Minhyuk, 24, saw it as an “inconvenience”, and Hyungwon, also 24, a self-proclaimed introvert with pink hair and a wry sense of humour, says only now does he understand Starship’s intentions in removing outside distractions. But Jooheon, 23, recalls he felt “walled in during training. There was no freedom. At least when you debut, you experience new things.”Their early, aggressive-sounding singles, Trespass and Rush, brought a solid fanbase, known as Monbebe. They shower Monsta X with clothes, toys, snacks and letters before shows and at album signings, where fans talk with each member, often holding hands with their favourite. To the cynical, it may be a genius marketing ploy but these meetings develop an emotionally symbiotic bond unique to K-pop – in a tough industry, the fans are, says I.M, a “source of strength”.The youngest at 22, I.M has an adult wariness from spending his formative years in front of cameras where the slightest error can bring career-damaging public criticism. “I worry about making mistakes, but I feel being an idol is natural to me,” he says. “Do I like having rules? Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but that’s real life and I’m fine with it.”Starship undeniably rules the Monsta X roost. Idol groups, with few exceptions, have little power, but in recent years a number have begun to exert some creative grip. Monsta X, too, are striving towards a level of autonomy. I.M pens solo material plus his lyrics on their tracks, as does Jooheon, and several of Wonho’s emotive pop songs are Monsta X album cuts. Jooheon reveals dozens of inspirational phrases on his phone and says he frequently gets by on three hours of sleep. “I feel uneasy if I don’t make one song every day,” he says, yet he and I.M have been able to release only a couple of solo singles. The group live together in a cluttered apartment but each has a small studio where they can create. “I’ll do everything there – eat, scream, cry, laugh, watch movies. It’s my playground,” Jooheon smiles.This downtime is crucial an idol’s schedule is back-breaking. Interviews, radio, variety TV, fan meetings and music shows make for 18-hour days. There is no off-switch once they are beyond the safety of their dressing room but there’s a family atmosphere within those confines they cheerfully eat together, banter noisily and rest when possible – Wonho dozes despite hairdryers blasting around him, Minhyuk sleeps so deeply it takes five minutes to wake him. “The workload can sometimes be too much but we need to grow. It’s good to be busy,” says Wonho. Kihyun, laughing, says: “It’s our third year. This is in my bones.” Fans call him Monsta X’s “mom”, although he refers to himself as the “police, keeping Monsta X within the boundaries”. But he is happy. “I’m doing something I love, I’m earning money and I don’t feel like I’ve sacrificed a lot.”For others, idol life is challenging. “I used to like being around people, but now I need space,” says Hyungwon. Minhyuk is a ball of a warm energy but beneath that is a poignancy. “I’m not an idol for fame, I just like to perform,” he says. “I don’t like going outside because I don’t like people gossiping, so it’s been almost two years since I went drinking with friends. Sometimes I’m lonely.”Even in the wake of Jonghyun’s suicide, mental health problems in South Korea aren’t always dealt with correctly or understood by either industry or the public, but Kihyun says it’s better than it was. “When artists say they’re going to rest, the reaction is: ‘Please rest before it gets worse.’” Starship’s Shim says they “monitor the mental health of all trainees and idols. If we feel like they’re emotionally having a hard time, we’ll suggest they see a therapist or work with them to figure out how to make them better.”Most successful K-pop groups will exist for five to seven years, and idols often head into presenting or acting, with some finding solo success. But male groups face South Korea’s compulsory two-year military service and the threat of career decline on return to civilian life. As a result, Shownu has adopted a day-by-day approach for Monsta X. “I used to think: would I be able to make a living from this?” he says. “There were teams that debuted at the same time as us but we weren’t going at the same pace.

Instead, the previously split north London council moved into overall Conservative control, amid Labour recriminations about antisemitism.In the most cheering news for Jeremy Corbyn, Labour became the biggest party in Trafford – formerly the Conservatives’ only council in Greater Manchester – and gained control of Plymouth, also from the Tories.But Labour fell short in areas where success had been anticipated, notably Barnet, but also the traditional London Tory strongholds of Wandsworth, Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea. Away from the two main parties, the Liberal Democrats had success in remain-minded London boroughs, while the Greens gained councillors. As predicted, Ukip was all but wiped out in seats defended by the beleaguered party.Another council where a major Labour campaign effort failed to pay off was Swindon, a traditional bellwether area. The party gained one ward from the Lib Dems but none from the Tories, who hung on to control of the Wiltshire council by one seat. Labour also lost control of Derby, Nuneaton and Bedworth.Barry Rawlings, the Labour group leader in Barnet, which has a strong Jewish population, acknowledged that antisemitism had been an issue. “I must say that in some wards where there is a large Jewish community, it has made a difference.”One defeated Labour councillor, Adam Langleben, tweeted: “No community group should have their vote dictated by their safety. That should shame us UKLabour.”Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, and a regular Corbyn critic, replied to say: “I am so so sorry. This defeat wasn’t yours.”Overall, in the first major test of voter opinion since last year’s general election, the main parties remained deadlocked – a result more likely to buoy Theresa May, who at one point had faced predictions of a leadership challenge if the local polls had gone badly for her.Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had enjoyed the better results. “I think it’s been a good night for us and it’s been a dreadful night for Labour,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “They were promising to sweep the board in London, and they haven’t gained, at the moment, a single council in London.”Andrew Gywnne, Labour’s election coordinator and the shadow housing secretary, said it had been “an election of consolidation”, where Labour had been defending many seats.But he sought to retrospectively play down the party’s chances in London, saying it had been “incredibly optimistic” to believe it could take some councils.He told Today: “Let’s remember, we’ve never even controlled Westminster. We last controlled Wandsworth in 1978. We made progress in those areas, let’s be plain – we picked up seats.”The Liberal Democrats recorded the biggest gains in initial seat numbers, gaining control of Richmond council and retaining power in Cheltenham, Sutton and Eastleigh – albeit from a low base when the seats were last fought in 2014.Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, told Today: “It’s a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We’ve been winning seats off Labour in the north in leave-voting areas. We’ve been winning in the south off Tories in remain areas. It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.”The Greens took six early seats, including two in Trafford from Conservatives. The co-leader Jonathan Bartley told the BBC: “If you’d told me four years ago this is where we’d be, I’d have been be thrilled.”Ukip, whose vote has collapsed since the EU referendum, lost 86 seats in early results, holding only two.Its former deputy chair, Suzanne Evans, conceded the party could be in terminal decline. “If Ukip does crumble I think you could still arguably make the case that it’s been one of the most successful political parties in history.”Labour’s most notable early success saw it win four seats from the Tories in Trafford, taking its total to 30. After the surprise double-win by the Greens in the Altrincham ward, the Conservatives were left with 29 seats, down from 33.“I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group. “This is far beyond our expectations. We hoped to tip the council into no overall control tonight, but to have become the largest party at the same time is a fantastic bonus.”But Labour’s attempt to take control of Wandsworth – controlled by the Tories since 1978 - was foiled after the Conservatives successfully concentrated resources in key strongholds amid a significantly increased turnout. Labour gained seven seats on the flagship Tory council that has been known for its low council tax and outsourcing of local services. Labour also failed to force the Tories out of power in Swindon despite a well-resourced campaign and a string of visits from Corbyn and other senior figures.The Labour group leader, Jim Grant, said he was disappointed. “We need to sit down and analyse the figures. Turnout was up all round. We got as many votes as we thought we would need to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/befa771749569bd21f906f2745d34dbf8fa10c1e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a76433e9faf3e58dd6ab81bdbea64039","title":"local elections how night unfolded key races","story":"Tories cling on to Wandsworth and Swindon, but Labour becomes largest party in Trafford – with Greens’ helpA much-touted Labour attempt to wrestle control of Wandsworth – controlled by the Tories since 1978 – was foiled after the Conservatives successfully concentrated resources in key strongholds amid a significantly increased turnout.However, Labour came close on a night when it gained seven seats on a flagship Tory council that has been known for its low council tax and outsourcing of local services.The final results left the Tories on 33 seats, Labour on 26 and one held by Malcolm Grimston, a former Conservative-turned-independent who had the largest personal vote of the night (4,002).Even before the results started to come in, London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, sought to manage expectations when he arrived at the count in south London, where his party had needed to take 12 Tory seats to win outright control.“Of course we may not win councils but I think winning councillors who are Labour is a fantastic achievement,” he said, when it was put to him by reporters that he and other Labour figures had “talked up” the possibility of winning Wandsworth.While Labour did make gains at the expense of the Tories, the latter fended off the challenge by increasing its vote to retain control of all seats in wards such as Fairfield, Thamesfield and Southfields.Ravi Govindia, the Tory leader of the council, said: “The strategy was to take the message to every household, to every door, to every resident and convince them that this was a council that had not run out of steam.”Both the Liberal Democrats and Renew, a new party seeking to carve out ground in the centre, failed to make any inroads in the Toriy or Labour vote in what was entirely a two-horse race. Ben QuinnLabour became the biggest party in Trafford, winning four seats from the Tories to take their total to 30. After a surprise double win by the Green party in the Altrincham ward, the Conservative party was left with 29 seats, down from 33.“I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group on Trafford council. “This is far beyond our expectations. We hoped to tip the council into no overall control tonight, but to have become the largest party at the same time is a fantastic bonus.”He added that, as the picture for Labour across the country was mixed, the result in Trafford was “a damning indictment of the local Conservatives”.The Conservative former council leader Sean Anstee said elections in Trafford were often tight. “Clearly, as the only Conservative-majority council in Greater Manchester, surrounded by a number of Labour councils, we’ve seen significant opposition activity into the borough over the last six months or so.” Anstee said there was also a significant increase in turnout in wards that had changed hands. “A number of voters who ordinarily perhaps haven’t voted, turned out,” he said. “We’ll need to reflect on the reasons why they turned out in the way that they did and why they voted in the way that they did.”While it didn’t surprise many to see the Conservatives lose overall control of Trafford council, it had not been predicted the Greens would land the final blow.Geraldine Coggins, one of two Green candidates to take seats from the Tories in Altrincham, said while their campaign went below the media’s radar, they were not surprised to have won. “I spoke to a number of people in their 80s who said they had always voted Conservative but were going to vote Green for the first time in their lives, and a number of Labour members who said they were going to vote Green this time. There was a lot of momentum,” she said. Frances PerraudinLabour suffered a major blow in Swindon, where it failed to force the Tories out of power despite a well-resourced campaign and a string of visits from Jeremy Corbyn and other senior figures.Corbyn’s party gained one ward from the Lib Dems but none from the Tories, who hung on to control of the Wiltshire council by one seat.The Labour group leader, Jim Grant, said he was bitterly disappointed. “We need to sit down and analyse the figures. Turnout was up all round. We got as many votes as we thought we would need to win.“Clearly the Conservatives were able to increase their vote. How, I don’t know. It may be the collapse of the Ukip vote and that has gone back to the Tories.At general elections, Swindon is seen at a bellwether – whoever holds the two seats wins power at Westminster. Labour was hoping a good showing in Wiltshire would be a sign that it could make inroads across the south of England.The Tory group leader, David Renard, said: “We got our positive message across. Labour ran a very negative campaign here. They have thrown a lot of resource, brought in a lot of people and spent a lot of money trying to take up to six of our seats. They failed to take every one. We have shown the Labour party is a long way from forming a government and on the doorstep there is a lot of anti-Jeremy Corbyn feeling.”Robert Buckland, the Tory South Swindon MP and solicitor general, added: “Labour, for all their kitchen-sink approach to this election, just aren’t ready. This is a town that for generations was a Labour town. They’ve had generations to prove themselves and they were rejected. Labour were expecting to take control or for there to be no overall control. They failed.” Steve MorrisKensington and Chelsea’s Conservative-run council has faced a year of relentless criticism for its handling of the Grenfell Tower fire, resulting in the resignation of council leader and contributing to the departure of many long-serving councillors.But the disaster did not stop the London borough’s voters rewarding the Tory administration with another overwhelming majority in Thursday’s election.The council has been controlled by the Conservatives since it was formed in 1964 and Labour went into this year’s election in a distant second place. But last June’s catastrophe, combined with the unexpected victory of Emma Dent Coad in the Kensington parliamentary constituency during the general election, had raised hopes of an upset. This did not come to pass. Instead the Tories finished on 36 councillors, with Labour gaining just one extra ward to win 13 councillors. The Liberal Democrats took the final seat.Labour gained votes in the wards near the burned-out remains of Grenfell but it struggled to main any inroads in the wealthier parts of the borough, even in wards they had been confident of taking from the Conservatives.“We have piled up votes in Labour-held wards,” said the Labour group leader, Robert Atkinson, saying his party’s gains would be limited because the Conservatives had managed to “frighten out” their vote across the west London borough.The Conservative leader, Elizabeth Campbell, used her victory speech to declare her party had a lot of work to do following last summer’s disaster.“We all recognise we still need to rebuild trust,” she said. “We must be and we will be open to all voices of our communities.“We all live in the shadow of Grenfell. Grenfell was,Grenfell is, and Grenfell will be our first priority.”The Kensington and Chelsea results also served as a cursory warning for iniduals tempted to set up a new political party. Advance Together, which had been compared to the French President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche movement, ran candidates in most wards but came consistently last.

Ideas for what teachers could choose to do with the time include studying or spending a year working in an industry relevant to their field.Only teachers with 10 years’ experience would be eligible to apply for the sabbatical, which a spokesman for the Department for Education (DfE) said was intended to help reward long service in the profession.The sabbatical scheme will form part of a package of measures designed to introducing more flexible working practices into the profession, which has been slow to implement part-time work and job shares. The proposals would put teaching on par with other industries, the DfE said. Hinds will also announce a range of other proposals: “We will be introducing an enhanced offer of support for new teachers – including extending the induction period to two years – and we will work with the profession to develop a new early career content framework that will set out all the training and mentoring a teacher is entitled to in those first years.”He will also say that he wants to develop “clearer career pathways” and make schools “attractive 21st century workplaces”.The proposals were welcomed by NAHT general secretary, Paul Whiteman. “We have a track record of working with the government on improvements to the system and we look forward to working with them to help define the detail behind these new proposals and to make sure that these joint ambitions are realised,” said Whiteman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea77304ec49edd71c315392c6b0bba79d2748296/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f6c2a0ac3e07a79766412037e9b11a","title":"local elections council england 2018 tories labour corbyn may","story":"Parties face biggest ballot box test since general election with council seats and mayoralties up for grabs across EnglandIn other election news, Sinn Fein are celebrating in Northern Ireland with a by-election victory in West Tyrone. Orfhlaith Begley, 26, declared herself a history maker as she became the first woman elected as MP for the West Tyrone constituency.The political newcomer comfortably held on to a seat relinquished by party colleague Barry McElduff when he quit amid a furore over a controversial social media post.McElduff resigned as MP for the area in January, 10 days after a controversy flared when he posted a video of himself with a Kingsmill-branded loaf on his head on the anniversary of the notorious Kingsmill massacre.Jeremy Corbyn made an early-morning visit to Plymouth to celebrate his party seizing control of the city’s council.Surrounded by cheering activists at Plymouth Hoe, the Labour leader said he was “delighted” by the result, adding: “The South West has the unenviable title of being the low-pay capital of Britain. That’s got to change and a Labour government will offer that change.“Today, winning Plymouth is a sign Labour is back in this part of Britain. Labour is back to gain parliamentary seats.“The mission of Labour is always to stand for a decent society and stand up against poverty in Britain, and that means local government must be properly funded by central government, and local councils that want to deal with the housing crisis and the social care crisis, and want a cleaner, better environment, are the ones that they should be supporting.”Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had a “reasonable night, a good night”.“We’ve seen interesting results across the country,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “When we look at what Labour were predicting... that simply hasn’t happened.”“When they were claiming the whole of London was going to turn red, they’ve not gained a single council.”Asked if the Tories have problem in urban areas, he said: “We’re working hard all over the country.We have to work and learn from that over the next few years as we go towards the next general election as we’re delivering on those domestic agendas on issues that matter to people in their lives every day.Adam Langleben, a Labour councillor who lost his seat in Barnet, told the :We knew this was a possibility since last night, that this was worse than the general election in 2017. Things have definitely shifted since June. Every Jewish Labour household we visited, people said, “not this time.” Activists were being told, “this is a racist party, an anti-Semitic party”, doors were slammed in their faces. We as Jewish Labour activists were told we were endorsing anti-semitism. The reason we have lost here is the inability to deal with this issue and to tackle anti-semitism.Jeremy Corbyn was supposed to come here tomorrow for a victory speech. We want him to come to Barnet anyway, to apologise to Jewish Labour activists, to Barnet Labour and to the Jewish community here so we can start the healing process. We won this election on ideas, the Tories just ran a relentlessly negative campaign. But just look at the wards with high Jewish populations where we lost, East Barnet, Brunswick Park, West Hendon. The seats with even higher Jewish populations, where Labour didn’t target as hard, the Tories have huge landslides.The Labour leadership and people around them have seen the signs for a long time and they have not acted.I’m not quitting, this is about the health of our democracy. We have two parties of government in this country and one has a sickness that it needs to deal with. People need to join the party they need to educate people and those who are anti-Semitic need to be immediately expelled. But first of all, the party can start by listening to Jewish activists and the community.Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s national campaign coordinator and a shadow communities minister, admitted the anti-semitism row had led to the Conservative victory in Barnet.“It disappoints me,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme.We have got a job to do to rebuild trust and confidence with the Jewish community across the country. I’m sure that is the case. I see it as my job to help rebuild that trust with the Jewish community. There are so many Jewish people who do share Labour’s values.Looking at the overall picture, Gwynne said “there was always going to be a limited number of gains we could make”.“It was an election of consolidation,” he said. He cited Labour victory in Trafford as a significant achievement but admitted there had been some “disappointing results in other parts of the country”.Asked about Labour’s performance in London, Gwynne said: “We did pick up seats in those areas.”“What we’ve seen is that politics is very polarised,” he said. “All published opinion polls show Labour and Tories pretty much neck and neck.”Here’s some reaction from the Twitter commentariat to the result in Barnet, which saw the Conservative win control, taking it back from “no overall control”. The Conservatives have won control of Barnet Council, taking it back from no overall control.The seat was a Labour target and political commentators on Twitter are already putting the result down to the anti-semitism row engulfing the Labour party. Barnet has a significant Jewish population, according to census data, with the second largest religious group being Jewish.Earlier, a defeated Labour councillor in West Hendon tweeted an apparent reference to the party’s anti-Semitism row, saying “we must NEVER have another election like this” after the Conservatives took all three seats from the party in the ward. Outgoing councillor Adam Langleben, who also sits on the national executive committee of Jewish Labour, tweeted: “No community group should have their vote dictated by their safety. That should shame us UKLabour.”The results are now in from 94 of the 150 councils holding elections. Here are the latest figures.That’s all from me. My colleague Jamie Grierson is taking over now. Here are the latest results from London.On the Today programme Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s co-leader, said the Greens had had “a really good night”. She said that they were now the official opposition in Richmond, that they had seats on four new councils and that some of the best results they were expecting were yet to come in, in places like Islington and Lambeth.In their morning email, the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush and Dulcie Lee reckon that the biggest winner of election night was the Lib Dems. Here’s an excerpt.Much to everyone’s surprise, the winner of the local elections is .... Vince Cable. The Liberal Democrats harvested local discontent effectively in Sunderland, gave Labour a fright in Hull, won back Richmond at a clip, held onto Sutton, Eastleigh and Cheltenham and are at time of writing the biggest gainers as far as seat gains goIt will silence - at least for a while - the noises off about Cable and his leadership. I’m finally leaving Kensington town hall following a disappointing night for Labour.The party had hoped to make gains in the west London borough, which is still dealing with the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster, amid speculation that it had an outside chance of taking control of the council.Instead Labour gained just one councillor as the Conservatives won another overwhelming majority, maintaining their control of a borough they have run since 1964.Labour even failed to take wards such as Chelsea Riverside, which it had been confident of winning from the Tories, as some local party activists suggested Grenfell had not been the deciding issue for most voters in the election, especially in the wealthier south of the borough.The final results left the Tories with 36 seats, and Labour on 13.“We all recognise we still need to rebuild trust,” said Conservative leader Elizabeth Campbell. “We must be and we will be open to all voices of our communities.”“We all live in the shadow of Grenfell. Grenfell was, Grenfell is, and Grenfell will be our first priority.”It was even worse for the new Advance Together political party, which had been compared to French President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche movement. It ran candidates in most wards, declaring that the “narrow demands of party politics has ill-served the people of Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea”. The people of Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea felt otherwise and the party came consistently last.Kensington and Chelsea is London’s smallest borough by population and just 37,000 ballots were returned in Thursday’s election. Despite this the final results were only declared at 6.30am, hours after many other larger councils had finished counting and gone home. Bleary-eyed Labour activists were left wondering what went wrong.Richard Angell, director of Progress, the Blairite pressure group in the Labour party (which is much disliked by the Corbynites), says Labour would not win a general election on the basis of these results.Nickie Aiken, the Conservative leader of Westminster city council, claimed her party’s victory in the borough was partly a vote against Momentum. She said:Labour thought they could take Westminster city council, and the people of Westminster sent a very clear message that Westminster would remain Conservative.The Labour party threw everything they had at us today. We had hordes of Momentum supporters throughout Westminster, particularly in the south, and the people of Westminster sent them the message ‘We do not like your politics’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edd0dec418a064a6eddb938df2627d59b0564476/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec1a968883e1de9501bcaf012d5b3f5","title":"local council election results 2018 in full","story":"Seats on 150 councils are up for grabs in this year’s local elections, the first major test of public opinion since last year\u0027s snap general election.

The InSight spacecraft aims to listen for quakes and unravel the mystery of how rocky planets such as Earth form. If all goes as planned it should land on Mars on 26 November.Since the Earth and Mars were probably formed by similar processes 4.5bn years ago, the US space agency hopes the lander – officially known as Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) – will shed light on what made them so different.“How we get from a ball of featureless rock into a planet that may or may not support life is a key question in planetary science,” said Bruce Banerdt, InSight principal investigator at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We’d like to be able to understand what happened.”On Earth these processes had been obscured over billions of years by earthquakes and the movement of molten rock in the mantle, he said.But Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun, and Earth’s smaller and less geologically active neighbour – may yield more clues.InSight aims to rest in an isolated spot and detect “Mars-quakes,” which Nasa described as “like a flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet’s interior”.The lander will gather information using three instruments, including a seismometer, called the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, made by the French space agency. Banerdt called the seismometer “the heart of the mission”.Scientists expect to pick up as many as 100 quakes during the mission, which should last at least 26 Earth months, or one Martian year.Most of the quakes are expected to be less than magnitude 6.0.Studying how seismic waves pass through the crust, mantle and core of Mars can help scientists learn more about what the layers are made of and how deep they are.The second key instrument is a self-hammering probe that will monitor the flow of heat in the planet’s subsurface. Called the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package, it was made by the German space agency with the participation of the Polish space agency, and is the first of its kind to be used on Mars.The probe should go 15 times deeper than any previous Mars mission, to a depth of three to five metres, said Nasa.A third instrument will help scientists on Earth keep precise track of the lander’s location as Mars rotates.The US spent $813.8m on the spacecraft and rocket launch, while investments on the instruments from France and Germany amount to $180 million, according to Nasa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce5617e6ad993a64050338d087fb197ee6b08a3/0_0_6574_4383/master/6574.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=80202aa14f025d00694329ab3b223eff 1400w","title":"child mortality rate one and a half times higher in england than in sweden","story":"More than 6,000 fewer children would have died between 2003 and 2012 if England’s rate had been the same as Sweden’s, researchers saidDeaths in children under five occur one and half times more often in England than in Sweden, a study has found.If the child mortality rate had been the same in England as in Sweden during the 10-year period analysed, more than 600 fewer children would have died per year, researchers said.The UK has one of the highest child mortality rates in western Europe, because although it has a similar level of economic development and healthcare to Sweden, the UK’s more unequal wealth distribution leads to poorer maternal health during pregnancy. This causes more babies to be born prematurely and with a low birth weight, researchers from the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said. Children born in England also tend to have more birth anomalies – such as congenital heart defects – than in Sweden.The study, published in the Lancet, used medical data from the NHS and the Swedish health service to compare births from 2003 to 2012 and track the children’s health and death records up to their fifth birthday.These records included information on the mother’s age, the family’s socioeconomic position, the length of pregnancy, the child’s birth weight and gender, and whether the child had any birth anomalies. Overall, the study included more than 3.9 million English births, with 11,392 deaths, and more than a million Swedish births and 1,927 deaths. Between two days and four years old, the child mortality rate for England was one and a half times higher than for Sweden (29 deaths per 10,000 children in England, compared with 19 in Sweden). If the child mortality rate had been the same, there would have been 607 fewer child deaths per year in England, equivalent to 6,073 in total over the period. The differences were mainly driven by differences in mortality among children under one. Lead author Dr Ania Zylbersztejn of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said: “While child deaths are still rare, the UK has one of the highest child mortality rates in western Europe.“Babies born prematurely or with low birth weight have an increased risk of early death, and those who survive are more likely to have chronic ill-health or disability.” Good maternal health – including maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding chronic illnesses such as diabetes and avoiding high blood pressure, psychological stress and infections – and healthy behaviours such as eating a balanced diet and avoiding smoking, drugs and alcohol are associated with healthy foetal development during pregnancy. This suggests many more people in England are socioeconomically disadvantaged, which is associated with pre-term births, low birth weight, birth anomalies and poor maternal health, reflecting circumstances and behaviours linked to poverty and stress. Prof Anders Hjern of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute said: “This study shows that the main explanations for the differences in child mortality rates between England and Sweden are systemic, and beyond the reach of healthcare services alone. “The key factors here are likely to include Sweden’s broader welfare programmes that have provided families with an economic safety net for over 50 years, the free and accessible educational system, including early childcare, and public health policies for many lifestyle issues such as obesity, smoking and alcohol use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fd38cd1d45f61ee13be034e7639ac794ff08c1/279_634_6212_3727/master/6212.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93f5984fc533684892866ca376b0f02","title":"team sky chris froome giro d italia accused 14m mauro vegni","story":"• Organisers unhappy after paying €1.4m for Team Sky to attend• Mauro Vegni criticises Dave Brailsford for his non-disclosureTeam Sky have been accused of deceiving the organisers of the Giro d’Italia into handing over a reported €1.4m in appearance fees by not disclosing that their star rider Chris Froome had already failed a drug test.According to the Giro race director, Mauro Vegni, Dave Brailsford’s team entered into negotiations over Froome’s appearance in the Giro knowing the rider had returned an adverse finding from a urine test on his way to winning the Vuelta a España in September last year.Sky secured a hefty fee for the four‑times Tour de France winner and a support team to contest the Giro, which begins on Friday in Jerusalem, the first time the race has travelled outside Europe.But on the eve of the event, Vegni made the remarkable claim that he felt let down by Brailsford after the  and the French newspaper Le\u0026nbspMonde made public news of Froome’s failed test in December. Vegni said this was the first time he became aware of the anti-doping case lingering over the Briton, which could lead to Froome being suspended from cycling for several months.Asked if he felt deceived by Brailsford, who was knighted for services to cycling in 2013, Vegni replied: “Definitely, yes. The negotiations with Team Sky took place before the Giro presentation so I would have expected within a correct relationship to be informed. I didn’t really like this.”In a bid to repair relations with the organisers, Brailsford flew to Italy to explain the situation. “I did express my thinking on the phone to Dave, he came immediately to Italy to meet with me,” Vegni said. “Dave himself was not pleased and he told me that in fact he did not receive the information until the end of September. But he also said to me that he was confident that this whole issue will find a solution.”The launch of the 101st edition of the Giro took place last November, with Froome confirming his participation via a video message. The 32‑year‑old arrived in Israel this week confident of clinching a triple crown of grand tour wins: the Tour de France, Vuelta a España, and now Giro, all in a row. But there is every chance his Vuelta title could be taken away if he receives an anti-doping rule violation.Tom Dumoulin\u0026nbspThe Dutchman is attempting to defend the pink jersey he won in thrilling style, overturning a 53 second deficit to secure victory on the final day of the 2017 edition of the Giro. Riding for Team Sunweb he is supported by two of the riders who helped him to success but has endured a tumultuous start to the season, plagued by mechanical issues in the Abu Dhabi Tour and abandoning the\u0026nbspTirreno-Adriatico after crashing several timesThibaut Pinot\u0026nbspAfter attempting the Giro and Tour double last season, the Frenchman will tackle the same challenge once again, hoping for a better result. He finished fourth behind Dumoulin last year, losing ground in the time trials but his overall victory in the Tour of the Alps, where he won by 12 seconds indicate he is in even better form this time round. With just two weeks since the end of that race and the Grand Tour it will be intriguing to see how the Groupama-FDJ rider has recovered.Simon Yates\u0026nbspNot as hotly fancied for the Giro title as his compatriot Froome but Yates has displayed eye catching form of late with two stage wins and an overall second-place finish at the prestigious Paris-Nice. The 25-year-old will\u0026nbsplead his Michelton-Scott team\u0027s bid to win\u0026nbspand said he is relishing that role and the opportunity to usurp the favourites. Finshing seventh on his Tour De France debut last year and sixth at the Vuelta a Ea in 2016 he has proved he is not overawed by the big occasions.Froome is attempting to explain why a urine test submitted after the 18th stage of the Vuelta on 7\u0026nbspSeptember indicated twice the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol. Cycling’s world governing body, the UCI, sent a letter to Team Sky, Froome and British Cycling to inform them of the failed test on 20\u0026nbspSeptember. It is understood talks with Giro organisers began in the following weeks.Vegni expressed his frustration that it had taken so long to reach a verdict. “I feel bad because of the extremely long times of the justice procedure. With the current means that are available to not have a decision made after eight months, something needs to change. We don’t even know when a decision will finally arrive.”In a statement, Team Sky said: “The UCI process regarding Chris would normally have remained confidential. The team wanted to fully respect this but since it became public we have stayed in regular touch with the Giro organisers about it. We received and agreed the final race contract within the last three weeks – obviously some time after the issue had became public. In all our conversations with the organisers they have been supportive of Chris’s participation in the race. We love the Giro. We are honoured to be competing at it and we can’t wait for it to start.”The extent to which Froome’s participation has dominated the buildup to this race was enforced in the pre‑race press conference. It took 33 minutes before any rider other than Froome or any of the other 21 teams competing here was discussed.“Thank you for someone who recognises that it is not just Chris Froome at the Giro,” an exasperated Vegni said. Froome’s principal rival in the next few weeks is likely to be Tom Dumoulin. The Dutch defending champion has had a tumultuous start to the season but Vegni intimated that a victory for Domoulin would be better than if Froome triumphed in Rome on 27\u0026nbspMay.“As organiser, I don’t really support any rider specifically, but let me add that Tom is a nice character,” Vegni said. “He’s young, he’s handsome, he is good for cycling as a whole. Also as an athlete he is a good performer. Let’s say that it would be really a good outcome for the Giro.”The mounting tensions over Froome’s presence are not the only contentious issue to plague the Giro this year. The decision to hold the opening three stages of the race in Israel has also led to the organisers being accused of “sport-washing”, using the event to distract from the rising heat of the Palestine conflict.The team presentation on Thursday evening took place on a giant pink stage in Jerusalem’s Safra Square, with smoke cannons and disco lights, introduced by the supermodel Bar Refaeli. But on Friday, less than 100km from here, the protests on the Gaza strip which have taken place every week since 30\u0026nbspMarch will continue unabated. The Israeli military has reportedly killed 35 Palestinians and injured more than 5,500 others during these protests, with Amnesty International suggesting some have been shot from behind and intentionally maimed.The tensions mean that an unprecedented police presence will be deployed along the route. More than 4,000 officers and two helicopters are securing the roads and the perimeter.Superintendent Mickey Rosenfeld, the Israel Police national spokesman, said it was the biggest sporting event to be held in Israel’s history.“We’re focusing on a mega-sport event and not political or security related issues,” he said. “But we are taking no chances. Our units will be at the right place at the right time. We are coordinating with border police, undercover units, special patrol units and our assessments will be made as events unfold. But no rider has personally expressed any misgivings about coming to Israel, as far as we know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e9edb0e9338763075da299f3e9aee89df996a0c/0_133_2752_1652/master/2752.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97e4d891d278d376601a1bd4340b3c17","title":"all in writer puts poker book on hold after making 200000 playing the game","story":"Maria Konnikova didn’t know how many cards were in a deck when she started learning poker one year ago but now she is winning major competitionsAn American journalist and author has put the release of her book about poker on hold because she has become so successful at playing the game.Maria Konnikova has won more than $200,000 since she started doing research for a book to be called The Biggest Bluff, about using poker skills to make “better decisions” in everyday life. Among those who helped her were poker legends Erik Seidel, Jason Koon and Isaac Haxton.“I’m certainly far from the first writer to play poker,” Konnikova said in a tweet. “But as far as I know, I am the first to go from not knowing the number of cards in a deck to winning a major title within one year.”That title was the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure, in which she won from a field of 230 players, including some major names in professional poker, to claim the $84,600 prize.Perhaps more important than the money, the prize includes entry to the next PokerStars No-Limit Hold’em championship. Konnikova said she delayed the book so she could keep “in shape” for the championship.“I should have had a first draft in long, long ago,” she told the New York Post from Monte Carlo, where she’s competing in another poker tournament. “I could never have predicted that I would ever be where I am now. I started this project with absolutely zero background in it.”Though she is enjoying playing poker and making money at it, Konnikova, whose previous book was on scams, intends to return to her day job.“I’m not abandoning writing. I really want to give it my all, but this is for the book ultimately,” she said. “There’s definitely one version of the future where I still write and play poker professionally. Why in the world wouldn’t I do both?”Konnikova’s story echoes that of Victoria Coren Mitchell, a columnist for the Observer and another writer to make a lot of money from poker. Coren Mitchell rose from being a relatively unknown player to being a poker superstar in 2006 when she became the first female winner of the European Poker Tour.

It was an engagement that had looked doomed from the off, faced with the natural self-interest of the teams, but the success bodes well for F1, the fans and the drivers, who can claim no small part in bringing about the first step in what should be a new era for the sport.F1’s new owners, Liberty Media, and the FIA have pulled off something of a coup by managing to secure the requisite votes at the F1 Commission to impose new regulations for next season. The key change is a new front wing, to decrease turbulent air in the wake of a car that prevents competitors following one another closely and hinders passing. The problem has been openly criticised by drivers but they can now feel genuinely optimistic about the future of F1.The former driver Alex Wurz is the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association and he is delighted with the decision. “It could be the starting point for a game-changer,” he says.Wurz is an out-and-out racer. He competed in F1 for four full seasons with some memorable performances, including going wheel to wheel with Michael Schumacher at Monaco, a superb podium at Canada in 2007 and a brilliant run to fourth in the wet at the Nürburgring the same year. He has won Le\u0026nbspMans twice and the Sebring 12 Hours once after a fine battle with Sébastien Bourdais over the final laps.Since he took up his role at the GPDA in 2014 the Austrian has also become hugely respected for working closely with the drivers. He reveals he has been having closed-door discussions with them almost every race weekend. Unsurprisingly what they want chimes with what the fans want to see.“We are very happy that Liberty, with the FIA, have seen that we can’t continue going down the road of creating artificial overtaking with DRS,” he says. “A natural overtaking manoeuvre that is purely and visibly down to the driver’s skill is what creates the biggest emotions for fans and drivers. If we can follow each other closely we are more likely to have old-school, authentic overtaking and that’s what the drivers would love to see and why this rule change is such good news.”The vote was not expected to go in their favour. The commission required four teams to support it, which was thought unlikely, but it is understood Williams, Mercedes, Force India and Sauber did so.The teams that did not support it have fairly clear objections. Firstly, there is a cost, both financial and in resources, associated with designing new aerodynamics and it is late in the season to have to apply it to the designs of next year’s car. There is also a fear that it is an untested theory that could backfire, and that it would be better to stick with the status quo until the next major regulation change set for 2021. That F1 and FIA have nonetheless stuck with a forward-looking, bold decision is indicative of a new outlook for the sport.He remains cautious that the new rules are not yet a done deal – Ferrari still have a right to veto it and may yet do so. “I was a bit surprised it went through,” he says. “This is a change which can reshuffle the performance order, therefore I thought the teams that are in power would stop it in their own interest but if it goes through it is a success for everyone pulling in the same direction and looking at the big picture.”For the owners, who have made changes aplenty since taking over last year, this is the first move to have a real effect on the racing itself. That they have managed an unlikely victory is something that will give Wurz, his members and fans cause to celebrate. F1’s future remains undecided and some very tough talking lies ahead, but Wurz senses this heralds a genuine wind of change in F1.“There is optimism,” he says. “There was an established paddock culture that came with a single stakeholder dictating the sport and it adopting his culture of being run. Now there is a new culture and it has still to merge. It will take years but once it starts and everyone aligns to the new thinking I think we will see it accelerate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09db6085f4acea1578a337d55910b5f9bd18c91/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98774c1f0878a71534333cf3285349b4","title":"big time sensuality bjork ballet rave puts san francisco under its spell unbound festival","story":"Arthur Pita’s show mixes eight of the Icelandic singer’s tracks into a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale at the Unbound festival With 12 new works, two specially commissioned scores and the world’s first Björk ballet, the Unbound festival by San Francisco Ballet (SFB) properly lives up to its title. Yes, there may be some predictable names among the dozen commissioned choreographers yes, there are only two women among them. But artistic director Helgi Tomasson has undertaken an exhilarating experiment in California – challenging audiences to take a risk on four ambitious triple bills and challenging choreographers to cut loose and play.Arthur Pita has never needed permission to play. As delinquent and riotous as some of his choreography has been, the setting of eight Björk songs in Björk Ballet still looks like nothing he’s ever produced. Visually, the work is a cacophony of glamour, craziness and fairytale: the stage transformed into a gled salt marsh by 40 clumps of silver grass the dancers costumed by Marco Morante to become, variously, a tinsel-cloaked fairy with raspberry-pink socks, a tango a, a scarlet butterfly and a chorus of clubbers in sequined muzzles.There is a hint of a story in the fisherman figure who wanders through the piece, alternately wearing sad and happy clown masks. At moments he cast his line as if fishing for dreams, and it is perhaps those dreams that Pita hears in Björk’s music. The scenarios include a group of lovers, locked in an underwater embrace a sexy goddess carried on a bier and a classical rave. A stageful of ballet dancers pogoing in perfect first position to Hyperballad is a sight to see.Viewed as pure choreography, some sections may seem disposable, even random, but as a synthesis of dance, music and design it becomes far more than the sum of its parts. Unlike so many pop-inspired ballets, Pita doesn’t ride the surface novelty of Björk’s music. Instead, he communicates something of the transgression, yearning, mischief and magic at its heart. Evanescent though it may be, Björk Ballet is a wonderful watch – surprising, mysterious and a ridiculous amount of fun.Pita is one of four British or British-based choreographers to feature in Unbound, and while he and Christopher Wheeldon have worked with SFB before, David Dawson and Cathy Marston are making their company debuts. Marston’s Snowblind is the more substantial, an adaptation of Edith Wharton’s Ethan Frome, a bleak fable of love, possession and loss that proves a smart choice for a one-act ballet.Working with an arranged score by Philip Feeney, Marston whittles her material down to around 30 minutes of pure dance. She uses a modest-sized chorus to evoke the story’s crucial element of snow her drifting choreography not only its figurative representation but also of the claustrophobic situation in which three characters – Ethan, his wife, Zeena, and the free-spirited Mattie with whom he falls in love – are trapped. There is a superb chemistry between casting and choreography. Sarah Van Patten is terrifyingly good as Zeena – her hands clawed, her spine rigid and her gaze steely with possessiveness and pain. Mathilde Froustey’s Mattie is her quicksilver opposite, light, sensuous and supple. Ulrik Birkkjaer’s Ethan, his back bowed from years of dutiful service, develops poignant layers of rectitude and longing.Marston keeps her language plain and functional when she needs to move her story along, but it blooms vividly when focusing on the characters’ inner lives. In one finely judged image she has Mattie kneel and rest her head against Ethan’s leg, concentrating the spontaneity, sweetness and willingness that make her so lovable to him. When the errant lovers try to escape, and Mattie is paralysed in an accident, Marston masterfully tracks the changing dynamics of power in a trio that ends with the two lovers clasped in Zeena’s arms and Zeena triumphantly in charge.Snowblind is the only literary ballet to feature in the festival, but some of the most abstract-seeming works carry an implicit theme or personal story. Gender identity is subtly addressed in David Dawson’s Animus Anima, which plays with the traditional dynamics of male and female dance languages. In The Infinite Ocean, Edwaard Liang contemplates death in Bespoke, Stanton Welch meditates on the transience of a ballet career and in Wheeldon’s Bound To, a cast of mobile phone-clutching dancers tackle the world’s addiction to social media.Wheeldon doesn’t typically moralise as a choreographer, but this idea takes his work to some interestingly expressive places. When a phone-free Dores André tries to seduce Benjamin Freemantle into paying her proper attention, their duet becomes a cleverly evocative experiment in dysfunctional partnering she initiating the moves, while he absent-mindedly responds. An intricately fluid, intimate quartet has four women recalling a time when they used to talk rather than text while an affecting solo for Lonnie Weeks shows a man stranded in solitary anxiety, among a group of phone-transfixed friends.What’s odd is how little trust Wheeldon places in his own language. Each section comes with a title projected on to the stage – “Open your eyes” or “Take a deep breath” – and in tandem with Keaton Henson’s overly saccharine score, these preachy little captions seem to trivialise rather than concentrate the choreography’s message. Dance often works its deepest effects through the gaps and ambiguities of its language. In contrast to Wheeldon’s over-signalling, the charm of Trey McIntyre’s Your Flesh Shall Be a Great Poem lies in its willingness to let the audience find their own way into the material.The work is about McIntyre’s grandfather, who died after suffering years of dementia. Set to the waif-like folk songs of Chris Garneau, McIntyre’s choreography cleverly evokes the past without sentimentalising. Freemantle as the young grandfather dances among his male friends with a slightly stilted jocularity. He flirts with sweetly artless young women, and McIntyre adroitly captures their inidual vulnerabilities in the rawness of the characters’ steps and their eccentricities of phrasing. At the end, when Freemantle is left alone, dancing a strange, ragged duet with a three-legged stool, we glimpse the pain of the grandfather losing his mind and the choreographer trying to piece it back together.Flesh is a very personal work, authentic and generous these are qualities disappointingly absent from Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s Guernica. A homage to Picasso, it throws together sex, politics, cubism and Spain in a high-gloss spectacle of bull-horned lovers, flamenco and blood red lighting . It’s all too much and while I normally admire her work for its breadth of spirit, Guernica feels overwrought and hollow. It is marvellously danced, however, as are all the works in the festival. Even if there are moments when this elegant, versatile and committed company look as though they could have done with an extra rehearsal or two, it’s impressive how fully and deeply they embody the range of choreographic idioms that have been thrown at them.Standout performances include Angelo Greco, his moulded line and impassioned attack beautifully showcased in the pure neoclassicism of Welch’s Bespoke Yuan Yuan Tan, spooling her eerily graceful body though Liang’s Infinite Ocean Sofiane Sylve magnificently regal in just about everything and Maria Kochetkova as a ferocious modern-day Odile in Dawson’s Anima Animus.The company shine in Justin Peck’s Hurry Up We’re Dreaming, set to a sequence of tracks by M83 with 14 dancers dressed in trainers, shorts and jeans. Peck has a special genius for choreographing ensembles, creating surges and crosscurrents of dance that sparkle with brilliantly bevelled detail. The heart of this beautiful ballet lies in the long, quietly ecstatic duet for Sarah Van Patten and Luke Ingham – a sequence of low lifts, gently delineated balances, and unexpected changes of direction during which the two dancers seem to move together on a single breath.I saw all 12 works over a weekend, and in that concentrated viewing some of the festival’s choreographers appeared markedly braver than others. But overall these ballets constitute a fine statement of faith in the future of the art form. If I were Tomasson and cherry-picking my dream triple bill, Peck, Marston and Pita’s works would be frontrunners, but Wheeldon, Dawson and McIntyre’s would not be far behind. Lucky San Francisco, to be so spoiled for choice.• Unbound festival runs in San Francisco until 5 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd9579f17be7bcadb3045e69034df8984cbf311e/0_136_4249_2549/master/4249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebb7e874ee67c1196e3bda1e63b0e8fc","title":"twitter change password bug discovered","story":"Company says it has fixed the internal glitch and has seen ‘no indication of breach or misuse’ but recommends precautionary stepsTwitter has urged its 336 million users to change their passwords after the company discovered a bug that stored passwords in plain text in an internal system.The company said it had fixed the problem and had seen “no indication of breach or misuse”, but it suggested users consider changing their password on Twitter and on all services where they have used the same password “as a precaution”.“We are very sorry this happened,” said Twitter’s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal, in a blogpost. “We recognise and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.”Companies with good security practices typically store user passwords in a form that cannot be read.

Residents in the Puna community, home to about 10,000 people, were ordered to evacuate.County, state and federal officials had been warning residents all week that they should be prepared to evacuate, as an eruption would give little warning. Nearby community centres have opened for shelter.One resident said lava fountains were shooting 150ft (45 metres) in to the air through a crack in the volcano.Ikaika Marzo told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that lava spread out over an area about 200 yards (182 metres) wide behind one house in Leilani Estates on Thursday.

The excavation proves early humans colonised the Philippines hundreds of thousands of years earlier than previously believed, though it is thought these hominims, or ‘Hobbits’, pre-date modern humans, known as homosapiens. Previously, the earliest confirmed evidence of human presence on the island was a foot bone found in a cave in Luzon, which dates back just 67,000 years. Aside from their appetite for rhino, very little is known about the humans who would have occupied Luzon, and the researchers are hoping to uncover more archeological clues as they continue to dig.It is possible they were homo erectus, who are known to have wandered to present-day China and south-east Asia up to a million years ago or could be their own distinct sub-species. Until recently, it was believed Luzon and the other islands of Wallacea in the Philippines would have been impossible for pre-modern humans to reach, as they would not have boats to cross the deep water. However, the team of researchers, including paleontologist Dr Gerrit Van Den Bergh from the University of Wollongong, said this called for a rethink of how and where early homonims had travelled in south-east Asia. “Our hypothesis is that the ‘Hobbit’ ancestors came from the north, rather than travelling eastward through Java and Bali,” said Ven Den Bergh, whose work was published in the journal Nature.“They may have been caught in a tsunami and carried out to sea.

The Labour party has made gains in London, while the Conservatives have had the best showing in the rest of England. We’ve had a reporting team up all night and our live coverage continues this morning, while our interactive page lets you keep track of all the results as they arrive.At time of writing, with results in from 87 of the 150 councils in England holding elections, all three main parties have achieved net gains in numbers of seats. Labour was on 1,072 seats (+30), the Conservatives 642 (+16) and the Lib Dems 278 (+24). Labour had won 44 councils (-1), the Conservatives 27 (no change) and the Lib Dems 3 (no change). Ukip were the biggest losers of the night. With results in from 87 councils, they had lost 35 seats, and won just two. Here is how the night unfolded in some of the key races.The results mean Theresa May has emerged unscathed from her first major electoral test since the general election. Preliminary analysis suggests that outside London there was a swing from Labour to the Conservatives. In London the trend was different, but Labour failed to secure high-profile gains that some in the party had hoped for. A much-touted attempt to seize control of Wandsworth was foiled by the Conservatives, who have held it since 1978. On the BBC election programme Justine Greening, the Conservative former education secretary and MP for Putney, said: “Maybe we are beginning to see something akin to peak Corbyn happening.” The Tories have also held Westminster, and Labour has conceded it can’t win Kensington and Chelsea. The Conservatives gained control of Basildon and Peterborough, both from no overall control.Jonathan Carr-West, CEO of the Local Government Information Unit, said: “At present it looks like a better night for the Conservatives than many would have anticipated, while Labour results have not quite lived up to expectations. The Lib Dems made big strides in terms of numbers of councillors and swept away the Conservatives in Richmond, presumably benefiting from being the only major party opposed to Brexit in the borough that recorded one of the highest remain votes in the country.“Overall though, we seem to be seeing an entrenchment of the status quo: a ided Britain in which big cities vote Labour and everywhere else votes Conservative,” said Carr-West.Novichok was made to kill – Up to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent may have been used in the attempted murder of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, according to the world chemical weapons watchdog. The quantity of novichok used in the Salisbury attack was much more than would be kept for research purposes, indicating it was made to be used as a weapon, said Ahmet Üzümcü, head of the OPCW. The poison was of a high purity and “very persistent” where it had been spread. Almost 200 military personnel in protective suits and boots are spending months decontaminating nine sites in Salisbury.Storm over Trump ‘hush money’ – Donald Trump is being accused of breaking campaign finance law after admitting he reimbursed the money paid by his lawyer to Stormy Daniels in the run up to the 2016 election. He previously said he didn’t know about it. The US president has insisted “no money from the campaign” flowed to the adult film actor who alleges an affair with him. But watchdogs and experts argue that Trump still broke the law by failing to include the $130,000 payment in campaign financial disclosures. Walter Shaub, former director of government ethics and Trump critic, said: “It is absolutely stunning that we’ve reached the point where the president of the United States appears to have lied to the US Office of Government Ethics about a payoff to a porn star.”Twitter password warning – Twitter has advised all its users to change their passwords after a security flaw was found. There was “no indication of breach or misuse” of the passwords, which had been stored as plain text on internal system logs when they should have been encrypted. Olivia Solon’s report explains the bug and what you should do if you’re on Twitter.One is thought to be the brig W Gordon, bound for Australia from Scotland in 1877 or the Magdala, lost in 1882 while sailing from Wales to Indonesia.

British politicians and counterparts in Europe say traditional diplomacy no longer works with Russia because its government simply lies whenever it’s got any explaining to do. “Putin is waging an information war designed to turn our strongest asset – freedom of speech – against us,” said Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee.You should spend some time today getting to grips with how the Russian government wages war on the truth – a prime example being its embassy in London, and the foreign minister himself, spreading conspiracy theories about the Salisbury poisoning. RT, Russia’s Kremlin-backed 24-hour news channel, is being investigated by the UK regulator Ofcom for breaches of impartiality rules –but the bigger story is its internet operation.

On Monday, the three main political forces will have just one day to cast aside their differences and come up with a solution after two exploratory mandates failed to yield results.After a promising start, relations between Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, and M5S’s Luigi Di Maio soured over the latter’s insistence that Salvini abandon his coalition partner, Italy’s disgraced former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.Meanwhile talks between arch rivals M5S and the Democratic party were scotched after another former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who still holds considerable power over the party, said he would not back a government led by M5S. The Democratic party, currently headed by caretaker leader Maurizio Martina, met on Thursday to decide whether or not to pursue formal negotiations with M5S. But Renzi’s stance is likely to hold sway.“There is a brutal struggle for power and I think Renzi will win – he’s in control of the party but, at the same time, this is the first time there has been a real revolt against him,” said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Sapienza University in Rome.“At the same time, Mattarella is asking for responsibility and there is a side of the Democratic party that is sensitive to what the president says and afraid of being in opposition. If there is space to move, they would prefer to be in government.”If Monday’s talks fail, then Mattarella is likely to seek a transitional government, potentially handpicking a leader, that would deal with matters such as approving the 2019 budget before new elections are held.Di Maio is pushing for an immediate re-vote, while Salvini, whose party has strengthened in polls since March, is said to favour a ballot towards the end of the year.Many Italians are unimpressed with the latest period of political paralysis gripping their country. “We are fed up and I don’t want to have another vote,” said Marina Mari, who voted for M5S in the March elections.“It would be a huge waste of money to hold another election. I trust Mattarella, but not the rest. But if the outcome on Monday means a government between M5S and the League, then at least it’s something.”“Salvini is in the best position because his electorate is more solid than the Five Star’s,” he said.But ahead of fresh elections, other experts say the League and M5S would need to agree on a new electoral law that would make it easier to achieve an absolute majority.“Needless to say, a French-style two-round system springs to mind,” Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based consultancy firm, wrote in a note earlier this week.“Although crafting one that does not get a thumbs down from the constitutional court may be a daunting task. One that requires at least an entente cordiale between the League and M5S.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d620df369a986a809ed16cfc25537fab5405c5e/47_5_664_398/master/664.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce8fba666359d901ab3917d5e927857d","title":"senior new zealand naval officer accused of hiding camera in embassy toilets","story":"Alfred Keating pleads not guilty over discovery of miniature camera in embassy bathroom in Washington where he was defence attacheOne of New Zealand’s most senior naval officers is accused of hiding a secret camera in the toilets of the New Zealand embassy in Washington, in an attempt to obtain intimate footage of people using the bathroom. Alfred Keating, 58, was a commodore in the New Zealand navy and was one of the country’s most senior naval officers before he resigned last month.Keating was serving as a defence attache embassy in Washington in July 2017. On 27 July a small covert camera was discovered in a unisex bathroom in the embassy when it fell out of a hiding spot in a heating duct.It had been positioned to capture images of anyone using the toilet. The embassy toilet was generally used by approximately 60 embassy staff.New Zealand police travelled to Washington to investigate, and brought the recording device back to be forensically examined.The investigation revealed the device had been in place for some months, as the homemade platform it was mounted on was covered in a thick layer of dust.On the day it was discovered the camera had been activated at 9am and had captured 19 images over a five-hour period of people using the bathroom.A search warrant of Keating’s home in New Zealand led to him being charged with attempting to obtain intimate visual recordings.The prosecution alleges that Keating’s computer contained software to operate the camera, and also that his DNA matched that found on the SD card inside the camera. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.Keating joined the navy in 1976 and has studied engineering in the UK worked as a team leader on the Australian and New Zealand Anzac frigate project served as New Zealand’s assistant naval attache and senior technical officer in the US and worked as the assistant chief of navy in Wellington."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Most parts of the country will enjoy sunshine with highs of 21 degrees expectedFormer junior minister set to become non-aligned member of the GovernmentThree baby deaths at Portiuncula due to serious failings, report findsWoman at centre of CervicalCheck cancer screening scandal says the situation is \u0026lsquodisgraceful\u0026rsquoMarks taken from blue Mitsubishi Mirage and silver Ford Fiesta match up, says gardaFlood defence scheme is first national co-ordinated response to climate changeTenants now paying on average \u0026euro232 more per month compared to previous peak in 2008Senators call for the resignation of HSE chief Tony O\u0026rsquoBrienMan deported to Jordan denied he represented a threat to national securityNUIG research team plans to extend initial laboratory tests to campus road networkEssential concerns surrounding the operation and governance of Scouting Ireland be addressed at meetingUN specialist says strong policy commitment could inspire other countries to follow suitHe admitted calling judge \u0026lsquoa satanic cult member\u0026rsquo on video clip posted on social mediaTerms such as \u0026lsquopsycho\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoschizo\u0026rsquo stigmatise ill and may prevent them seeking helpPerpetrator who was 15 at the time pleads guilty to assault causing serious harm to victim"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483403.1525371682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse officer regrets not checking if women were told of false tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom left,  Dr Jerome Coffey, director, National Cancer Control Programme, Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, Department of Health, and Dr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer,  at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe HSE’s chief clinical officer, Colm Henry, has said he regrets not checking whether women with cervical cancer were being told about false negative smear tests when he learned about it last August.Dr Henry said he was told last summer the CervicalCheck national screening programme had changed its communication policy and the affected women would be told about discrepancies in past tests. However, he did not follow up to verify that they had been informed.He was speaking at a press conference in Dublin convened by the State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, to address public concerns about the national screening programme in the wake of the scandal involving women with cervical cancer not being told about false smear test results.Dr Henry said he learned, after a meeting between the CervicalCheck screening programme and leading clinicians on September 1st, 2017, the programme’s communication policy had changed following a year-long dispute with doctors over whose responsibility it was to tell the women.At the time, he was the HSE’s national clinical adviser to the country’s acute hospitals.“In retrospect, had I known that this didn’t happen – that patients weren’t being informed – even in my then role as an adviser with no authority over these people, I would certainly have done things differently,” he told reporters at the event in the Royal College of Physicians. “But I was basing my actions at the time on the assumption that people were following through on what they told me they were doing.”He took assurances CervicalCheck’s communication policy had changed “at face value”, he said.“Do I regret that now? Of course I do. I had no reason to doubt what they were telling me. If I was going back now, with the benefit of hindsight, I regret I didn’t go further. At the time I acted as best I could,” he said. Asked whether he should consider his position in light of his knowledge of the communications failures, he replied: “I had no involvement in the screening programme at the time.”Dr Holohan said he learned women had not been told only on Thursday of last week following the High Court case taken by Limerick mother-of-two Vicky Phelan, who secured a €2.5 million settlement from a US laboratory which assessed a test for CervicalCheck. Ms Phelan discovered a 2011 smear test that had originally shown no abnormalities was, three years later, found to be inaccurate, but she was not told of the false test until September 2017.In the aftermath of her case, a HSE audit found that of 1,482 women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the past decade, errors were found in 208 cases where tests showed no abnormality but should have raised a cancer warning. Some 162 were found not to have been told. Of the 208, 17 have since died.The cases of a further 1,518 women with cervical cancer who were not screened by CervicalCheck will also be audited. Correspondence from the case shows that Dr Henry was made aware of the dispute between CervicalCheck and the doctors in August 2017 over who should tell the women about the tests. Dr Holohan defended Dr Henry’s actions, saying he did not believe there was any requirement for Dr Henry to escalate his concerns about the issue to the Department of Health last summer.“I don’t think that it is necessary that every issue that is identified within the HSE requires for its effective management to be escalated to the department,” he said.The State’s chief medical officer sought to reassure the public that there was no problem with the quality of the screening programme itself. “Clearly there was a substantial failure in terms of communications that should not have happened, that needs to be adequately explained and needs to be fully investigated,” he said.Dr Henry described the controversy as a “failure of clinical governance”.Dr Jerome Coffey, director of the National Cancer Control Programme, said there was “a tiny, tiny probability” – less than one in 100 – of false negative smear tests. He praised the CervicalCheck screening programme for helping to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by about 7 per cent a year.

File photograph: Bryan O’Brien Rents have risen by 70 per cent since bottoming out in the recession and are now 23 per cent higher than their Celtic Tiger peak, according to a new report.The study shows rents increased during the first three months of 2018 – the 23rd quarter in succession – as the number of rental properties available nationwide continued to decline.Daft. ie’s latest quarterly rent report shows rents rose 11.5 per cent nationally in the year to March and were up 2.8 per cent on a quarterly basis. This marks the largest first-quarter increase since 2014.The average rent across the State during the first three months of the year was €1,261, a monthly increase of €232 compared to the previous peak in 2008. Commenting on the latest figures, Dr Ronan Lyons, assistant professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin and author of the report, said rents across the country were considerably higher than in a decade ago despite general prices having barely changed during the same period.“It is clear that, for those who have to look for a new home in the open market, rental inflation remains well above any reasonable measure of health. But as ever, rents are only the symptom,” said Dr Lyons.“The cause remains a chronic and worsening lack of rental supply. Policy must focus on dramatically increasing the construction of urban apartments over the coming years, in order to meet both the backlog of demand and the country’s needs over coming years and decades,” he added.In Dublin, where the accommodation crisis is particularly acute, rents are now 30 per cent higher than their previous Celtic Tiger peak.Rents in the capital rose by 12.8 per cent over the year to March. Other urban centres also showed significant increases with rents up 17.1 per cent in Limerick. In Waterford, the rise was 14.6 per cent while in Galway and Cork, prices rose by 13.6 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively.Outside the five main cities, rents were up by an average of 10.1 per cent.According to Daft, there were 3,200 properties available to rent nationwide in the first four months of 2018. This is the lowest number ever recorded for this time of year by the website, and marks a 17 per cent decline versus the same period a year earlier. In 2009 by contrast, an average of almost 21,000 properties were available.In Dublin, there were just 1,265 homes available to rent last month, one-third below the average over the last five years.The country needs close to 50,000 homes a year to cater to underlying housing demand with more than 15,000 rental homes required a year. Dr Lyons said the latest figures would not be welcomed by policymakers given that they show the introduction of rental increase caps in cities have failed.“By focusing on limiting rent increases, rather than boosting the supply of rental accommodation, policy is merely shuffling the fixed stock of rental homes between a number of tenants and prospective tenants,” he said.

Temperatures will start to creep up from Friday with the cool north-easterly winds of recent days being replaced by warm air from the Azores. All parts of the country with the exception of west and north-westerly coastal fringes will have a sunny weekend.Friday will see highs of 18 degrees and it will be mostly dry. Saturday will be a brighter day with sunny spells and highs of 19 degrees.Sunday and Monday will see the fine weather continue and will get the warmest of the sunshine. Temperatures will be between 20 and 21 degrees in parts of the midlands and east. Tuesday will be the last day of the current good spell. The best weather will be in the southeast. Current indications suggest that on Wednesday, rain will spread from the west with showers bringing cooler conditions.The forecast is excellent news for those attending the biggest events of the bank holiday weekend: the Ed Sheeran concerts in Cork’s Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. The forecast is for the fine weather to persist for all three concerts which will attract 120,000 music fans to the newly refurbished stadium. It is also set to be fair for the Bon Secours Hospital Great Limerick Run on Sunday which is the largest participant event outside Dublin taking place in Ireland every year. About 14,200 participants are expected to take part in the three races. The Shine a Light on Summer Festival will take place over the weekend at five lighthouses - at Fanad Head in Donegal, at Hook, the world’s oldest working lighthouse in Wexford, at Loop Head and on the islands of Rathlin in the North and Valentia in the south west. Details are here: http:www.greatlighthousesstoriesshine-a-light-2018. There will be talks and tours of the lighthouse. There will be widespread disruption on Dart and train services north of Connolly Station over the bank holiday weekends. There will be no Dart services between Connolly and HowthMalahide on Saturday and Sunday. On northern commuter routes bus transfers will operate between Connolly and Malahide, with trains between Malahide and DroghedaDundalk, to a revised schedule. On the Belfast Enterprise, bus transfers will operate between Connolly and Drogheda, with trains between Drogheda and Belfast. Irish Water Safety has issued a bank holiday appeal to the public to always wear a lifejacket when boating and to ensure that children are supervised while swimming. Despite the early summer weather, Irish Water Safety has warned that sea temperatures, at an average of 9 degrees, are too cold for an extended swim.

Building for the future, reaching out to unionism and building bridges between our communities so that we can live in a shared and reconciled future together,” she said.The new MP said that in order to create a shared Ireland with a place for “every single citizen” it was important to reach out to unionism.“Hopefully going forward we will have that open and shared debate about the Ireland that we want to build together,” she said.She also said that in the midst of the Brexit negotiations, the return of a Sinn Féin candidate was a clear indication that the people of West Tyrone “have rejected a hard Brexit and a hard Border once again”.Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald and Northern leader Michelle O’Neill were at the count centre in Omagh Leisure Centre for the result.“This is now a vindication of the Sinn Féin position for real power-sharing based on equality and based on respect,” said Ms McDonald.“It’s certainly a vindication for our position on Brexit.“The people of the North voted to Remain.“We have the electoral energy for us to move forward and to plan economically, socially and politically for what are going to be very challenging times,” she said.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017.

François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3484031.1525413531!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk local elections 2018 theresa may avoids london wipeout","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupporters of the British Conservative Party react during the count at Wandsworth Town Hall on Friday.

With results in from 87 councils, they had lost 35 seats, and won just 2.“The Conservative Party has been reminded tonight that the electorate that it now has is disproportionately a ‘Leave’ electorate,” polling expert John Curtice told the BBC.“Therefore above all it seems to me that what the Conservative Party has to be able to do in the coming weeks and months is to deliver on Brexit in a way that will satisfy the aspirations of leave voters,” he said.Against a backdrop of heightened expectations for the Labour Party, the ballot also showed the limitations of its recent resurgence under veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn.Mrs May’s party held on to control of Wandsworth council - a low-tax Conservative stronghold since the time of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.The council had been one of Labour’s more ambitious targets in Thursday’s vote and one it campaigned heavily to win. “There, at the moment, isn’t really very much for the Labour Party to crow about ... it basically has come away frankly empty-handed relative to the expectation that it at least helped to build up,” Mr Curtice said.Voting decides more than 4,400 council seats, determining the makeup of 150 local government authorities who are responsible for the day-to-day provision of public services. They do not affect seats in parliament, where May has only a slim working majority thanks to a deal with a smaller party.The Conservatives also held the symbolic council of Westminster in the heart of London’s political district, indicating that the final scale of losses in the capital would come in at the lower end of the predicted range.Despite retaining overall control, the Conservatives lost inidual seats in Westminster and Wandsworth. Ruling parties typically suffer losses at local elections and polls ahead of the vote predicted a bad night in London for the Conservatives after eight years in power.Mrs May is also negotiating an exit from the EU that 60 percent of the capital rejected at the 2016 Brexit referendum.Results elsewhere in London’s 32 boroughs showed the forecast swing to Labour in the capital had materialised, although not strongly enough to inflict the heavy losses that would pose a serious headache for Mrs May.Mr Corbyn has endured fierce criticism in recent weeks over the handling of anti-Semitism within his party. Critics also say he misjudged his response to military action in Syria and a row with Moscow over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in southern England.Outside London, the Conservatives regained control of councils in the pro-Brexit regions of Peterborough and Basildon, largely at the expense of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP has suffered leadership issues and struggled for a new purpose since achieving its primary political aim at the 2016 Brexit referendum when Britons decided to leave the EU.But Mrs May’s party lost control of the highly prized council in the Trafford area of the northern city of Manchester - its only foothold in an important Labour-dominated economic region where the Conservatives have spent years trying to win support.The overall tally, not due until approximately 7pm on Friday, will offer the most complete snapshot of public opinion since an election last year in which the Conservatives suffered unexpected losses, leaving Mrs May weakened and her party arguing openly about Brexit.Mrs May will remain under pressure from rival Conservative factions: those who want to keep close ties with the EU by staying in the customs union, and others who say anything short of a clean break is a betrayal of the Brexit referendum result.That issue is expected to come to a head with at least one vote on it in parliament next month. - Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Hot vapor emerged from a crack and spattering lava began to erupt.An ash plume rises above the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii\u0026#39s Big Island Scientists said areas downslope of the erupting vent were at risk of being covered by lava. Leilani Estates appeared to be at greatest risk, but scientists said new vents and outbreaks could occur and it\u0027s not possible to say where.The eruption comes after days of earthquakes rattled the area\u0027s Puna district. A nearby school was closed due to the ongoing seismic activity and several roadways cracked under the strain of the constant temblors.The Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse on Monday, triggering a series of earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.USGS geologist Janet Babb said the magma crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point, on Tuesday night.Hawaii County Civil Defence Agency closed the area to visitors on Tuesday and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo\u0027s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes. Please review our commenting policyLocal elections 2018 live: Labour fail to make

12 different countries Best known for the unforgettable image of a scowling celestial body annoyed that a rocket ship has crashed into its eye in A Trip to the Moon (1902), Melies was most recently seen in Martin Scorsese\u0027s film Hugo (2011) where he was played in old age by Sir Ben Kingsley.He was born in 1861, the son of luxury shoemakers who - after attending the prestigious Lycee Louis-le-Grand, completing military service and serving an apprenticeship as a clerk in London - shunned the family business to work as a conjurer at the Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris.Here, Melies developed a fondness for stagecraft and visual effects, working with mechanical automata, trapdoors and lighting, eventually selling his boot factory shares to his brothers and buying the theatre outright. After seeing the Lumiere Brothers sensational moving picture camera in action in 1895, Melies rushed out to establish his own studio and began making films that featured clever illusions and tricks created by experimenting with double exposure, cutting and rewinding, building on his theatrical innovations.Using elaborate painted sets akin to those of Paris\u0027s music halls, Melies was a true pioneer who played a key role in the evolution of cinematic technique and the medium\u0027s storytelling grammar.He also had an acute sensitivity for the sort of blockbuster spectacle audiences would be attracted to.Specialising in horror and steam punk science fiction, taking inspiration from the fiction of late Victorian visionaries Jules Verne and HG Wells, his most famous film remains A Trip To The Moon, which starred acrobats and dancers from the Folies Bergere and the Chatelet ballet.As fantastic as this is, perhaps even more extraordinary is the later Tunnelling The English Channel (1907), in which he effectively predicted the advent of Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel.Other celebrated works including The Vanishing Lady, The Haunted Castle (both 1896), The Astronomer\u0027s Dream (1898), Bluebeard (1901), The Impossible Voyage (1904), The Merry Frolics of Satan (1906) and Baron Munchausen (1911).The aftermath of a cyclone in a short by Georges Melies (Getty)Tragically, after more than 500 short films, Melies\u0027s career collapsed with the onset of the First World War. He went bankrupt and was forced to sell his back catalogue to Pathe.An early setback had come when Melies planned to release A Trip To The Moon in America, only to find that Thomas Edison\u0027s representative Al Adabie had secretly copied a print of the film after bribing staff at a London cinema and had already released it in the US without permission - an early and particularly devastating case of film piracy.Later reduced to running a toy stall and selling sweets at Montparnasse train station in Paris (as depicted in Hugo), Melies became so embittered that he dug a hole in his garden, filled it with what remained of his priceless reels and memorabilia and burned it all.What was lost that dark day is almost too painful to think about.However, he did live long enough to see his films reassessed and acclaimed and to receive the Legion d\u0027Honneur before finally passing away in 1938.27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Amazingly, a colour print of A Trip To The Moon was unearthed in a French barn in 2002 in which each frame had been meticulously hand-painted by a large female work force a century earlier.The world greeted its restoration and re-release with the same excitement and anticipation of its premiere at a Paris fairground and the film continues to inspire affectionate parodies and homages in everything from the Smashing Pumpkins\u0027 video for Tonight, Tonight (1996) to Futurama (1999-2013) and The Mighty Boosh (2004-13).or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The department’s top civil servants acknowledged the fear of some “clunky fixes” and that some functions would not be performed “as slickly as they are at the moment”. Both problems would arise if the government fails to secure an exit deal, or that deal is rejected by parliament, and it carries out its “no deal” exit threat.The committee demanded an update from Defra by next month, “in case negotiations break down”.“Given its poor track record on IT delivery, Defra must ensure it has the necessary resources in place to complete its IT programmes on time and avoid costly and embarrassing contingencies involving manual completion and submission of forms,” it said.Ms Hillier added: “Departments are under extreme pressure.

DIT, formed in direct response to the EU referendum result, has mission-critical responsibilities. All departments have much to do.”The report also criticised the Treasury for failing to set out, until March, how much funding each department would receive in 2018-19 to prepare for Brexit.It eventually announced that Defra would be allocated £310m and Dit £74m, out of a total pot of £1.6bn.Department for Environmental Food \u0026 Rural Affairsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That said, we want people to know it is an issue we take very seriously in the Labour Party.Council leader Richard Cornelius, a Conservative councillor, also said voters were generally more concerned about local issues rather than accusations of antisemitism within Labour.It\u0027s things like potholes, the collection of their rubbish bins and keeping the council tax low, he said.Of course there is a concern about anti-Semitism in the Jewish areas, and of course there is a wider concern about more generally - people are horrified, and Labour have to address that.It\u0027s been very close.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsThe Conservatives controlled Barnet from 2002 until it fell back into no overall control this March when one of their councillors, Sury Khatri, resigned.They made concerted efforts to target wards with large Jewish populations in the wake of the controversy convulsing Labour.The breakthrough came when they took a seat off Labour in Hale ward and all three from the long-time Labour stronghold of West Hendon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

What we are looking for is incremental gains that will lay the foundations,” he said.The Conservatives also did not have huge amounts to cheer about as they lost Trafford, their only council in Greater Manchester. Please allow a moment for the live blog to load...Shadow local government secretary Andrew Gwynne admits there have been disappointing results, after the party failed to deliver on its hopes to topple several long-held Tory councils.\u0026nbspIt was an election of consolidation. It was always going to be a limited number of gains that we could make within some of those councils, he told the Today programme.Politics\u0026nbspis now very polarised. It has been since the general election on June 8 last year.What appears to have happened last night is that the Ukip vote has absolutely collapsed and in parts of the country that Ukip vote has come to Labour but in other parts of the country it has gone to the Conservatives.In a number of those London boroughs and metropolitan boroughs outside London, the Labour Party was already defending very substantial seats so in terms of numbers of extra gains it is very difficult to make the big numbers that you might expect.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is in Plymouth, where Labour wrested control of the city council from the Tories.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn told activists: Today, winning Plymouth is a sign Labour is back in this part of Britain. Labour is back to gain parliamentary seats.The mission of Labour is always to stand for a decent society and stand up against poverty in Britain, and that means local government must be properly funded by central government, and local councils that want to deal with the housing crisis and the social care crisis, and want a cleaner, better environment, are the ones that they should be supporting.He said he was absolutely proud of all the work done there by Labour.The Liberal Democrats are jubilant over their results so far. Former cabinet minister\u0026nbspSir Ed\u0026nbspDavey\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspadvances in areas like Richmond were\u0026nbspa sign of things to come.He told\u0026nbspToday: People are desperate for a voice that isn\u0027t a right-wing Brexit Tory voice or a left-wing Corbynista voice.Under Vince Cable, Liberal Democrats can become that and last night\u0027s results show we are becoming that.The polls are showing that more and more people are disappointed by the mess the Tories are making of Brexit and they want to hear an alternative and they want, above all, to have a final say on the deal.State of parties after 94 of 150 councilsConservatives: 28 councils (-1) 776 seats (-11)Labour: 48 councils (-1) 1,291 seats (+44)LibDems: 4 councils (+1) 324 seats (+45)Green: 21 seats (+6)UKIP: 2 seats (-41)Independent: 61 seats (-46)Liberal: 1 seat (-1)Ratepayers and Residents: 38 seats (-3)No overall control: 14 councils (+1)\u0026nbspThe Conservatives have won control of Barnet Council, taking it back from no\u0026nbspoverall control, with three wards left to declare.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspState of parties after 14 of 32 London councilsConservatives: 4 councils (-1) 271 seats (-46)Labour: 8 councils 434 seats (+29)LibDems: 2 councils (+1) 94 seats (+18)Independent: 4 seats (-5)Ratepayers and Residents: 3 seatsA defeated Labour councillor in Barnet\u0027s West Hendon tweeted an apparent reference to the party\u0027s anti-Semitism row, saying we must NEVER have another election like this after the Conservatives took all three seats from the party in the ward.Outgoing councillor Adam Langleben, who also sits on the national executive committee of Jewish Labour, tweeted: No community group should have their vote dictated by their safety. That should shame us @UKLabour.Labour held on to Croydon, gaining two seats in a result which left the south\u0026nbspLondon borough with 41 Labour councillors and 29 Conservatives.\u0026nbspThe Conservatives have retained their hold of Kensington and Chelsea council\u0026nbspJonathan Carr-West, the chief executive of the\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLocal Government Information Unit (LGiU), said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove only seen a few councils change hands at this stage in the results but at present it looks like a better night for the Conservatives than many would have anticipated, while Labour results have not quite lived up to expectations.\u0026nbspIn London, Labour were targeting flagship Conservative councils like Wandsworth and Westminster but have fallen short despite increasing their number of seats.\u0026nbspLabour needed to talk up the possibility of gains to get their vote out, but now risk disappointment even though Wandsworth and Westminster (both Conservative for more than 40 years) were always going to be a long shot.\u0026nbspOutside London the picture is one of Conservative consolidation. In places like Swindon, Nuneaton, Basildon and Southend, Labour need to win if they are to win a general election but the Conservatives are tightening their grip.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, the Lib Dems made big strides in terms of numbers of councillors and swept away the Conservatives in Richmond presumably benefiting from being the only major party opposed to Brexit in the borough that recorded one of the highest remain votes in the country.\u0026nbspOverall though, we seem to be seeing an entrenchment of the status quo a ided Britain in which big cities vote Labour and everywhere else votes Conservative.\u0026nbspHowever, we shouldn\u0026rsquot forget that these elections are really about important local choices not just a giant opinion poll. That\u0026rsquos the basis on which candidates were campaigning. How far people vote on local rather than national issues is impossible to tell. But, though it\u0026rsquos an unfashionable truth, most councils around the country do a pretty good job and it may be that in large part we are seeing incumbency rewarded.State of parties after 88 of 150 councilsConservatives: 27 councils (-1) 653 seats (-11)Labour: 44 councils (-1) 1,072 seats (+28)LibDems: 4 councils (+1) 317 seats (+49)Green: 19 seats (+7)UKIP: 2 seats (-35)Independent: 52 seats (-40)Liberal: 1 seat (-1)Ratepayers and Residents: 14 seats (-4)No overall control: 13 councils (+1)Labour have retained control of Brent after winning 33 seats, with the Conservatives on three and 24 results still to come.Carrie Symonds, the Conservatives Director of Communications, says the results are brilliant news.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLeading pollster Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said there was little for the Labour Party to celebrate in the results.He told BBC News: There is very little in the way of Labour gains.Yes, they have denied the Tories control of Trafford but that\u0027s a very strong Remain area.Beyond that, there isn\u0027t very much for the Labour Party to celebrate.State of parties after 10 of 32 London councilsConservatives: 3 councils 186 seats (-18)Labour: 6 councils 338 seats (+27)LibDems: 1 council 54 seats (-6)Independent: 4 seats (-3)Ratepayers and Residents: 3 seatsLabour have retained control of Enfield, winning 42 seats with the\u0026nbspConservatives on 15, and six\u0026nbspseats still to be declared.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoad moreResults will continue to trickle in throughout Friday, with the final councils expected to declare around 7pm.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Later, some of them said they were informed they had been “chosen” to escort the men to a nightclub.“They weren’t putting a gun to our heads, but it was mandatory for us to go,” one of the cheerleaders told the New York Times, adding that some of the women were “devastated” by the news.Redskins officials on the trip, like Lon Rosenberg, the senior vice president for operations, and Dennis Greene, the president for business operations, appeared to “condone all of this,” one cheerleader said.Redskins president Bruce Allen said in a statement that the team was looking into the situation, and treating the allegations seriously. Based on the dialogue we’ve had with a number of current and former cheerleaders over the past 48 hours, we’ve heard very different first-hand accounts that directly contradict many of the details of the May 2 article, Mr Allen said. I can promise that once we have completed looking into this matter, if it is revealed that any of our employees acted inappropriately, those employees will face significant repercussions.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown on the predictions and which were correct.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour also targeted Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.But results revealed Labour have failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster from the Conservatives, but they have gained Plymouth.The Lib Dems kept hold of Sutton, their last London council, and managed to snatch Richmond-upon-Thames.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.This morning Trafford turned red as the Conservatives lost their narrow majority but they held their majority on the other three councils.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.Stockport, Dudley, Walsall, and North East Lincolnshire have remained as councils with no overall control with Newcastle-under-Lyme sill yet to declare.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that backed Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party also targeted Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.Basildon turned blue but Colchester and Portsmouth are still councils with no overall control. Pendle is expected to declare this afternoon.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 showed 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.The stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, as a large Jewish population could reject Labour over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.Prof Curtice was proved correct with his prediction for Basildon and Peterborough as both turned blue last. Pendle is yet to declare and Rugby stayed Conservative.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold onto Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.UKIPs electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent, and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets council are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwhich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees, and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwhich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow, and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing, and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimate two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge, Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge, and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth, and Hackeny being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They were journalists, murdered on the job as they tried to report on the details of an earlier bombing.On the same day, BBC reporter was shot dead in the countrys eastern Khost province, marking the day out as the the deadliest day for journalists since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015.It makes it all the more poignant that today is World Press Freedom Day, a date to celebrate the principles of press freedom and defend reporters around the world from attacks like these.Without a free press, its impossible to hold the powerful to account, expose injustices and fight for justice on the issues affecting ordinary people.And the world would become a far more confusing place without the reporters who dedicate their lives to unearthing the truth and sharing it with us all.Compared to countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, where journalists are routinely killed or jailed, it may seem like we have little use for Press Freedom day in the UK.But the sad truth is that there are major issues with press freedom close to home as well.Last month, Reporters Without Borders released its Press Freedom Index - a record of how free the media in each country is, based on the threat of government clampdowns and intimidation by journalists.Staggeringly, the UK came 40th out of 180 countries - worse than every other Western European nation apart from Italy.Best five countriesNotable othersWhen the index began in 2002, the UK ranked 22nd - but since then our position in the freedom league table has plummeted.This is partly due to the threats of Parliaments Data Protection Bill, which would force tougher rules on the press and give the state more power to regulate and ultimately muzzle the media.Another problem for press freedom in the UK is the general “climate of hostility towards the media”, which has seen British journalists threatened and intimidated online just for doing their job.Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, has received so much online abuse that she was assigned her own bodyguard last year.In other countries, like Afghanistan, press freedom is under threat from bombs and bullets as well as from the government and social media.On Monday, a bomb went off during rush hour in Kabul, and journalists in the city rushed to the scene so they could cover the story.But an ISIS fighter arrived at the site of the blast with them, disguised as a reporter.He joined the crowd of journalists on the scene and detonated - hammering home the warning that an official press vest can mark reporters out as targets, rather than affording them any protection.These deaths bring the total number of journalists killed so far this year to 24.In 2017, the total stood at 82, with 13 journalists killed in Mexico, 12 in Afghanistan and 11 in Iraq - the three most dangerous places to be a journalist.The years total was the lowest tally since 2007, according to the International Federation of Journalists, but it is still 82 too many.Elsewhere in the world, journalists still face the threat of being locked up for the crime of exposing the truth.Last year, 262 journalists were arrested - the highest number in almost three decades.Turkey is the worst offender, with 73 journalists currently behind bars, while 41 journalists have been imprisoned in China and 20 in Egypt.Its a sign that, on World Press Freedom Day, we have a long way to go and hard battles to fight before journalists around the world can be free to do their jobs without fear.But today is also a day to be thankful for the brave reporters who rush selflessly into danger armed with only their cameras and notebooks.And it is a day to remember all the journalists who have already given their lives in pursuit of a story. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tenants across the country should not be stung by unexpected costs.That’s why we’re delivering our promise to ban letting fees, alongside other measures to make renting fairer and more transparent.But the Bill is not set to become law for at least another year, meaning thousands of renters will have to pay an extra £233 on average in the meantime.And charities today raised concerns that loopholes in the legislation could still be slapped on through the back door.Dan Wilson Craw, Director of Generation Rent, said today: “There is a risk that not all tenants will be protected thanks to an exemption that could let some landlords continue to charge fees on spurious grounds and will be hard to police properly. This potential loophole should be taken out of the legislation.“And setting the cap on deposits at six weeks’ rent leaves in place a big barrier to moving home. The government needs to look at how to reduce the burden of this, for example by allowing the transfer of deposits between tenancies.”Britains chronic housing shortage is the second most important issue to the public, new studies have said.Theresa May has vowed to fix Britains broken housing market, vowing more new homes and ripping up planning rules which slow building down.She says she wants to build more homes more quickly and promised to ease the misery of millions of private renters too.Earlier this month she insisted that renters must be treated like human beings and said she would protect them from cowboy agents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re all I know and so unknown. I cannot hold you, yet I do.”Prayers were led by parish vicar the Rev. Rob Gladstone and touching messages of support were read out by school friends of Maddie’s younger twin siblings Sean and Amelie, who didn’t attend.Eminent heart doctor Gerry, who has just returned from a hectic work trip to Scotland, thanked the 70-strong crowd for turning out.He said: “It means an awful lot for so many people to come out on such an unhappy day - another anniversary. But it gives us strength and your support for us is tremendous.”Gerry, 49, dressed casually in jeans and grey sweater, joined locals placing name tags of symbolic missing and lost people on a vine tree of hope temporarily placed at the heart of the village.Among 28 selected names read out as they were attached to the branches were Claudia Lawrence and April Jones, and Madeleine McCann.During the 25-minute gathering a sombre-looking Kate handed out Maddie bookmarks, with a prayer which the crowd chanted together.The former GP, 5O, dressed in jeans and purple hooded jacket,  later hugged supporters.The Rev. Gladstone opened the informal service  by saying “It is a very poignant anniversary. We pray for Madeleine and encourage Kate and Gerry in faith, hope, strength, perseverance and courage.”Crowds of supporters, family, friends and locals assembled at the war memorial where a lantern - a beacon of hope - still shines brightly around the clock for the world’s most famous missing child.Kate and Gerry had earlier told of their “hope and perseverance” in a posting on the official Find Madeleine Campaign website.Brave Kate and Gerry cling onto a glimmer of hope that Maddie - who would now be aged 14 - could  still be alive.The couple have recently been buoyed up by Scotland Yard’s continuing support to help find their daughter.Police have been given an extra £154,000 to keep the search going until the end of September.Three-year-old Maddie vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May 2007.She was discovered missing from her bed in the rented apartment by her horrified mum shortly after 10pm.She had been left alone with younger twin siblings while her parents were dining in the nearby tapas restaurant with their seven pals.Retired head teacher Brian Kennedy - Maddie’s great uncle - who also lives in Rothley, said: “It would be lovely to have a gathering one day which will be a celebration.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403288455.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"patrick plunket dashing guardsman the queen royal family","story":"Patrick Plunket was the only other  man  she  ever  looked  at, and to this day she thinks of him.The dazzlingly handsome former Guards officer spent 25 years in her service. He was more than a courtier and much more than a friend.He danced with her. He joked with her. He served her and guided her. And when her marriage hit a rocky patch, he comforted her.In her 92 years, no other man has ever been that close to the Queen, apart from Prince Philip.In 1975, when bachelor Plunket died from liver cancer aged just 51, the Queen was plunged into grief.Breaching all protocol, she ordered a royal funeral for him at St James’s Palace. Again, she broke precedent by attending his memorial service.Then she ordered that a memorial temple should be built to him in Windsor Great Park. She had a hand in its design and chose the flowers to be planted around it.Many times since Plunket’s death, when the Queen has gone to watch polo at nearby Smith’s Lawn, she has slipped away to sit, alone, beside the white-painted colonnaded temple built in her friend’s name in the park’s beautiful Valley Gardens.Nobody ever mentions these visits — nobody ever has — as the grief is too private.Such behaviour from a monarch who has spent a lifetime shielding her emotions from her subjects is unprecedented. But then, as Elizabeth was to confess herself, there was nobody to equal Patrick Plunket.They had been friends since childhood. But when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952, aged 25, the relationship changed . . . and deepened.Patrick’s father, Irish peer Lord Plunket, had been a close friend of Elizabeth’s parents, then the Duke and Duchess of York.Plunket’s mother Dorothé was a half-American heiress and the couple were worldly and sophisticated members of the international set.But when Patrick was just 15 they died in a plane crash and he inherited the family title.In World War Two he served in the Irish Guards, then became an equerry for Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. When Elizabeth became queen, she appointed him Deputy Master of the Household.As such he masterminded the Queen’s banquets and State receptions, as well as the Royal Ascot house parties. He revelled in it, loving nothing more than to please and surprise his royal boss.As they discussed menus, guest lists and ways to keep boring guests at arm’s length, they became closer.Plunket’s cousin, Lady Annabel Goldsmith — mother of Jemima — said: “He adored her from the outset.“They enjoyed a very special connection. He was the one member of her staff who could talk to her on equal terms.“There was an openness and honesty between them based on respect, friendship — and a lot of teasing.”But the relationship was more than that. In 1956, when Prince Philip disappeared off on a world tour for four months on the royal yacht Britannia, Plunket provided a shoulder for the Queen to lean on, helping her through the lonely days and weeks.The royal marriage had reached a crisis point. Prince Philip had devoted himself to rejuvenating the monarchy and to selflessly serving the wife he loved, but there were impossible pressures on him.Yet the reforms that Philip sought in the Palace and beyond were often turned aside or ignored.“I’m just a bloody amoeba,” he complained, implying he was only there to father the next monarch — and nothing more.Philip’s 1956 tour seemed endless, and nobody seemed to know when he would come home. Questions were asked in the House of Commons.Reports started appearing in the American press of a serious rift in the royal marriage and rumours came back from Australasia of girls and parties aboard the Britannia.It was hastily arranged for the Queen to meet her husband in Lisbon, Portugal, before he returned home. And perhaps in a moment of panic, worrying that she might lose him, she made Philip a Prince of the United Kingdom — until then he had been only a Greek prince.At Windsor, Plunket continued to hold the Queen’s hand throughout the crisis. Lady Goldsmith said: “He was tall, impeccably dressed, with a voice full of merriment and his eyes crinkled up with laughter. He radiated an irrepressible sense of fun.”Philip finally came home and the royal marriage was rekindled.There had been a ten-year gap between the birth of Princess Anne and their next child, Prince Andrew — but things were back on track. If Philip had had an itch, it had been well and truly scratched.And yet there was still a need for Patrick Plunket by the Queen’s side.Her biographer, Sarah Bradford, said: “While Philip was off dancing with one of his women friends, Plunket would whirl Elizabeth on to the floor.“He’d notice at parties if she was looking lonely, scoop her up and dance with her, always there if she looked a bit lonely.”Royal biographer Charles Higham added: “He was slender, handsome, with thinning, dark hair and aristocratic profile. The Queen was very fond of him, very probably in love with him.”Historian Sir Roy Strong added: “He was one of the few who could give the Queen a glimpse of the world outside.”Plunket was not just playful, he was practical too. When the Queen discovered she needed a tiara for a formal occasion and found the Buckingham Palace safe was locked, he raced away and came back with a Plunket family heirloom.When she visited his house — a rare honour for a royal servant, however lordly — she teased him for looking “like a dentist” in the expensive portrait he had recently commissioned from artist Graham Sutherland.They laughed together a lot, especially during those crisis years. And even when he was terminally ill, he struggled from his sickbed to attend one last formal duty at Buckingham Palace, numbed by morphine as he tied his bow tie.That night, the Queen and her adoring courtier knew it would be the last time they would meet.Weeks later, at his memorial service at the Guards Chapel, his cousin Lady Goldsmith glanced at the Queen and “caught a look of deep sadness”.For the only time in her life, Her Majesty had a hand in writing an obituary for The Times, stressing Plunket’s unselfish service and duty.The article made it sound as though his service was for the whole Royal Family — but its meaning was clear to those who had witnessed Elizabeth and Plunket laughing together.A year after his death, with the position still vacant, a courtier asked the Queen who would replace him as Deputy Master of the Royal Household. She answered: “No one will ever replace him.”And so to the questions many people will be asking — was the Queen ever tempted? Was she unfaithful to Prince Philip, a man who has never quite escaped the swirl and fog of gossip about his own private life?Did Her Majesty succumb to the charms and handsome good looks of the 7th Lord Plunket?Royal biographer Robert Lacey, doesn’t think so. He said: “Opinions vary on Plunket’s sexuality,” and he quoted a fellow Guards officer who said: “He was one of those lucky characters who was just neutral.”But Charles Higham has a different take. He said: “Even if her royal duty had not been utterly binding, she could never have entered into a relationship with him, because he was homosexual.”Whatever the level of their relationship, it was intense and lasting. He was the only other man in her life.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.And a Tory source added: Labour are failing in target seats across the country.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:Mr Corbyn this morning rushed to Plymouth for a victory rally after Labour took control of the Devon citys council.He ignored the results in most of the country as he told activists: Im delighted that Labour has won in Plymouth.The mission of Labour is always to stand up for a decent society and stand up against poverty in Britain.The partys other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.But a party source said: The results so far show we have consolidated our vote since the General Election, especially in places we made gains.This stands us in good stead and lays the ground for further advances and a win in the next General Election.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.With nearly two thirds of the councils declared, all three parties had slightly increased their number of councillors - at the expense of Ukip, which has almost totally collapsed.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout the night, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell predicted it would be a “really mixed” night for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40% of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield City region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403202728.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"960\" width=\"960","title":"these people are sharing the strangest things theyve seen while travelling on the new york subway","story":"Commuters in London probably could tell their own tales of some weird stuff seen going on down underground on the tube, but New Yorkers just have to go one better.Is it really essential to have your umbrella up while going up or down town, inside a train that’s underground?Or maybe you just prefer to travel au naturel and let it all hang out?Perhaps you feel you were born to be wild but life got in the way of your dreams, so now you decide to ride your little moped whilst riding the network.Then again why stand or sit like every other normal, sane person when you can try to impersonate Spiderman and hang upside down."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000401539246.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hottest bank holiday on record","story":"Around 8.5million extra cars are predicted to make journeys this weekend as families kick-start long weekends in sweltering Spring temperatures.Some 3million will make a dash for their cars after work on Friday - with a further 2.5million following on Saturday.Millions more will travel to see friends and family on Sunday and Monday, according to the RAC.Combined with normal weekend traffic, coastal regions and major roads leading into them are likely to to be hardest hit with massive congestion.Rod Dennis, of the RAC, warned of Bank Holiday traffic chaos if the weekend was a scorcher as predicted.He said: “While motorists have told us about their firm travel plans as part of our research, if we see things really warm up by the weekend it’s likely to mean millions more cars on the road, which is bound to cause queues on popular routes.“We urge all drivers to give their cars a quick once over before they set off, especially if they are planning on driving any great distance.”Travel havoc will also hit railways and airports.Network Rail is seizing the opportunity for a raft of engineering work over the weekend – including key routes in and out of London, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter and Liverpool.Eurostar routes to Paris may also face cancellations because of worker strikes in France.Plane journeys across the Channel are likely to be disrupted as Air France pilots, cabin crew and ground staff stop work in a row over pay.The airline has already cancelled three of six flights from Heathrow to Paris.Train and air passengers are being urged to check their services are still running before heading off on their journeys.For those staying in Britain, temperatures could reach a balmy 28C by Monday to make it warmer than the French Riviera, Spain and Morocco.The south of England is likely to see the best of it but other parts will still revel in mid to low 20s sunshine.Bank Holiday Monday is on course to eclipse sun-hotspots across Europe and north Africa.Nice, on the French Riviera, will be 23C while Barcelona is forecast for a cooler 21C.Marrakesh in Morocco is forecast for just 23C.Forecasters predict the scorching Spring heatwave could last until the middle of next week.The sunshine revival follows a miserable week of rain where three inches fell in just 24 hours on Monday – 50 percent more than the April average.With the mercury back on the up, bookies have slashed this month to be the hottest on record to 5/2.May to have the hottest day of the year so far is chalked up at 5/4.Chris Bulmer, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office said: “For Bank Holiday Monday itself it is possible that temperatures could be near record-breaking.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were gains in Peterborough and Basildon, the latter a result of capitalising on UKIP\u0027s demise.In London, the Tories also successfully defended Wandsworth and Westminster boroughs despite Labour hopes they could take both.Meanwhile, Dudley remained in no overall control but the council\u0027s Tory leader was confident a UKIP councillor and independent Conservative would join their group to hand them effective control.With more than half of the results declared, Labour were one council down with the Tories unchanged overall.Counting was set to continue throughout Friday, when mayoral results will also be declared.

They\u0027re not that bad. She probably has more to fear in terms of her survival right now from the Brexit civil war being fought out in her Cabinet and on the Tory back benches.Labour, in the other hand, will no doubt stage an inquest into why they didn\u0027t do better, particularly in London, and suffered losses outside the capital.Has the party reached - or even passed - \"peak Corbyn\" in these polls?
