But I loved it for its outlandish ambition, carefree theatricality and aphoristic wit and wisdom.I also loved the extravagant adventure of our renamed hero ‘Peter’, played by James McArdle. He is a self-styled Caledonian fabulist who never knows when to give up. He starts out conning his crofter mother about his exploits in battle, but his stories are all nicked from old war movies.         Overblown, over indulgent and well over three hours long, David Hare’s exuberant reinvention of Henrik Ibsen’s Peer Gynt as a wayward Scot won’t be everyone’s idea of a fun night out, writes Patrick Marmion         But I loved it for its outlandish ambition, carefree theatricality and aphoristic wit and wisdom, writes Patrick MarmionAnd so begins a lifetime of fibbing and trying on different ideas and attitudes in an epic quest for elusive self-knowledge. It sees Peter become a billionaire arms trader and, eventually, a cantankerous spiritual nomad.Following Ibsen’s 1876 verse odyssey, Hare explores Peter’s life as a metaphor for the way we live now, obsessed as we are by fantasies of self-realisation. But it’s also about how that leaves us chasing shadows. ‘Life,’ as Peter laments at one point, ‘is a hell of a price to pay for being born.’Like Hare’s writing in verse, McArdle’s tirelessly inventive and gorgeously abrasive performance sees Peter dragging himself through his existence by plugging into his libido and unleashing his restless life force.At his lowest ebb - his mother’s deathbed - he becomes enraptured by a vision of heaven as a celestial tea party complete with lemon drizzle cake. Shameful highs, meanwhile, see him lording it over rich and famous sycophants on his Florida golf course. ‘I feel sorry for people who don’t have an adjective,’ he declares, before drooling over his own descriptor: ‘Gyntian’.Equal parts social satire, existential meditation and unbridled shaggy dog story, Jonathan Kent’s flamboyant production with song and dance lifts its leg and makes its mark on just about any subject going. It may defeat sceptics and wear out the willing, but this is swashbuckling theatre, kicking around the sort of big ideas that scare off lesser writers.         I also loved the extravagant adventure of our renamed hero ‘Peter’, played by James McArdle, writes Patrick MarmionIt is ingeniously staged on Richard Hudson’s set of a gorse-covered Highland knoll with changing projections of sky and sea beyond.And there are peachy cameos, including Ann Louise Ross as Peter’s scoffing mother and Guy Henry as a sprightly Angel of Death.If you have an appetite for such excess, you can also catch it at this year’s Edinburgh International Festival.  Midsummer is perfect for a night outdoorsBy Melanie McDonaghA Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream (Shakespeare\u0027s Globe)Verdict: Three-parts pantoRating:  Regent\u0027s Park Open Air TheatreVerdict: Dark Magic Rating:  Jellyfish (National Theatre Dorfman)Verdict: Doesn\u0027t wobble on the tough issuesRating: We\u0027re spoilt for choice when it comes to productions of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, with three of them in London alone.But it’s outdoor theatre that comes into its own, weather allowing, in the summer.You start with the gathering of Athenian nobles while it’s light, and as darkness falls you enter the enchanted world of fairies in the forest and the anarchy of dreams.         Amber Jones pictured as Titania at the Open Air Theatre in a performanceIt’s the ideal play, then, for Shakespeare’s Globe and the Open Air Theatre. But these are very different productions (though at both the audience has a ball).Sean Holmes’s production at the Globe is as close as you’ll get to Shakespeare as panto. Every double entendre is exploited, no chance of bump and grind missed, the opportunities for gender swapping joyfully exploited. It’s a riot of colour and filthy fun, and Jocelyn Jee Esien is a bouncy Bottom dressed as a pinata — but Shakespeare gets lost on the way.It’s not clear why Peter Bourke’s Theseus is a pink parody of a South American generalissimo, when he needs authority. Why is Titania’s bower a recycling bin? Why do all the characters get a go at playing Puck? And why do we struggle to hear the words? With planes overhead you need decent diction and terrific projection.Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre works its magic for Dominic Hill’s production. But it has a dark side. The changeling child is the creepiest doll you’ve ever seen, Rachael Canning’s big arachnid fairies are the stuff of nightmares, Kieran Hill’s Theseus is a thug and Myra McFadyen sits on Oberon’s knee like a sinister Scottish ventriloquist’s doll.Yet it’s joyous stuff. Michael Elcock is a dishy Lysander. As for Gareth Snook’s Welsh take on the man nervously in charge of the tradesmen actors, it’s funny even before he opens his mouth.         The Jellyfish is perhaps the most life-affirming play in town, yet it’s about disability, Down’s syndrome and prejudice, writes Melanie McDonagh         know, I know but this play, written by Ben Weatherill for Sarah Gordy, is so true, tender and funny, it’s hard not to be captivated, writes Melanie McDonaghYou can follow the plot and hear the words. Hooray.The Jellyfish is perhaps the most life-affirming play in town, yet it’s about disability, Down’s syndrome and prejudice. I know, I know but this play, written by Ben Weatherill for Sarah Gordy, is so true, tender and funny, it’s hard not to be captivated.In this terrific cast of four, the focus is on Sarah Gordy as Kelly. She’s got Down’s and she’s got star quality.Perhaps because she doesn’t have to try to represent someone with Down’s, she plays true. Certainly, she is terrifyingly blunt. ‘Will you kiss me?’ she asks her nervous would-be boyfriend, Neil, played with unbearable niceness by Sion Daniel Young. That’s how she is: cutting straight to the heart of things, whether it’s asking Neil to have sex, or her mother if she’d have aborted her if she’d had a test. Her jokes are filthy.         In this terrific cast of four, the focus is on Sarah Gordy as Kelly. She’s got Down’s and she’s got star quality, writes Melanie McDonaghThis play, too, is explosively direct on the taboo subjects. Kelly’s mother sets up a fabulously comic date between Kelly and Dominic, a boy with Asperger’s, played with poignant particularity by Nicky Priest. His ambition is to have a sex life. But he wonders whether there’ll be a time when ‘people like us’ will be done away with. ‘I don’t want to go the way of the woolly mammoth,’ he reflects.There was a Down’s girl very like Kelly in the row in front of me, with a crop top and blue hair. At the end she punched the air. ‘Amazing,’ she said.  Pi\u0027s puppet tiger earns his stripes  By Patrick MarmionLife of Pi (Crucible, Sheffield)Verdict: Tiger burns brightRating: Motion sickness is tricky to pull off in theatre, but then again so is casting a full-size Royal Bengal tiger. And there’s still the question here of a lifeboat adrift for almost a year in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.But Max Webster’s remarkable staging of Yann Martel’s bestseller about an Indian boy called Pi shipwrecked en route to Canada is equal to all that.Lolita Chakrabarti’s deft adaptation emulates the surreal charms of the book and the film. She tells the story from the point of view of the Mexican hospital, where our hero washes up.         Motion sickness is tricky to pull off in theatre, but then again so is casting a full-size Royal Bengal tiger. And there’s still the question here of a lifeboat adrift for almost a year in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, writes Patrick Marmion         But Max Webster’s remarkable staging of Yann Martel’s bestseller about an Indian boy called Pi shipwrecked en route to Canada is equal to all that, writes Patrick MarmionThe dramatic limitations of a man and a tiger eyeballing each other at sea are overcome by having Pi’s relatives summoned in his imagination. A boy of about nine became a little green around the gills and bailed out before the interval on Tuesday.I think he was alarmed by Nick Barnes and Finn Caldwell’s life-size puppet-tiger devouring a papier-mache goat. And who can blame him?The standard of puppetry is War Horse level. Look closely and you’ll see the tiger’s diaphragm lift and fall and its rear leg twitch as it snuffles, moans and roars. With other puppeteers on all fours operating an orangutan, zebra, hyena and interloping rat, this is exceptional, back-breaking work.No less impressive is Tim Hatley’s set that is transformed from featureless white hospital to deep blue sea thanks to projections of waves that crash across the floor and flood it with fish teeming below.And swirling around Pi’s revolving lifeboat that rises out of the stage, you even get a sense of the Pacific’s heave and swell.         Lolita Chakrabarti’s deft adaptation emulates the surreal charms of the book and the film, writes Patrick MarmionWebster proved himself adept at directing special effects in the Old Vic’s The Lorax last year, but Hiran Abeysekera is also a perfect Pi. His innocence and faith in himself and others radiates across the stage and brings the elements together.There are sticky moments and I don’t like the way Martel backtracks on his story in the end, but this should be remembered for the theatrical magic of the tiger who came to sea."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/07/12/16/072D8B1F000007D0-7241517-image-a-79_1562947145985.jpg","title":"TUI flight passenger says eat crisps 10 hour flight","story":"Share this article Miss Malgrati tweeted that the meal was an \u0027awful end to my two week holiday\u0027.She added: \u0027TUI, please explain to me how this is humanly edible?

While not exactly sybaritic, it did have an unforgettable sense of spatial and social drama. Replete with a four-tier ing platform and a 15ft deep end – “Scotland’s deepest deep end” – the pool was usually a frantic free for all, bodies churning in water, some hurtling perilously off the ing boards.Ingrained in my memory, it resembled the pool in north London painted in 1971 by Leon Kossoff, the figurative artist who died earlier this month: packed with swimmers plashing and cavorting, you can practically smell the chlorine. Kossoff’s vision of cacophonous communality contrasts with David Hockney’s lushly ambrosial Californian pools of the same period, with their narcissistic lone bathers, aptly epitomising the difference between swimming in the public and private spheres.Whether for survival, sport or recreation, humans have always found a reason to swim. Healthful and sociable, swimming is an unmitigated inidual and collective good, kind to bodies of all ages, shapes and dispositions. It is also the most sensuous form of physical exercise. Paul Valéry, the French poet and philosopher, described it as “fornication avec l’onde”.Summer brings out pleasure-seeking bathers, frolicking in the cooling embrace of lidos, ponds and sea baths. Last year’s intense heatwave saw siege conditions at London’s Brockwell Lido, one of the capital’s more popular open air pools. And so, with immaculate timing, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, this month opens Into the Blue, a display telling the story of British bathing habits. From Roman baths to Zaha Hadid’s London Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool comes to life through the architectural drawings, photographs and models in the RIBA’s collections.Andrea Palladio’s conjectured reconstruction of the Baths of Caracalla, the second largest of ancient Rome’s thermae, roots formal bathing culture in classical antiquity, though its origins go back much further. Equipped with hot, cold and tepid baths, together with gymnasiums and libraries, Caracalla was a hedonistic temple calculated to cultivate body and mind. Bronze mirrors directed sunlight into the natatio or swimming pool, capable of holding 1,600 people.Roman baths provided the model for the bath houses that emerged in Britain from the 17th century onwards. Over time, these evolved into the modern, more sportif pool. De Arte Natandi, published in English in 1658 as The Compleat Swimmer, provided early instruction on technique, with woodcuts illustrating variants of breaststroke and backstroke. However, as an activity with salacious propensities – scantily clad or naked people in proximity to each other – swimming was disdained and discouraged, especially by the church.Cleanliness was always next to godliness. The Baths and Wash-houses Act of 1846, which established a network of public buildings in British towns and cities, was primarily impelled by a Victorian crusade against dirt. Associated with ignorance and immorality, dirt was also seen as an impediment to an efficient workforce. Swimming was a secondary preoccupation but it gradually gained ground, accommodated in increasingly elaborate Victorian baths.One high point was the Charing Cross floating bath of 1875 moored on the Thames at Hungerford Bridge. Engravings of the time show moustachioed bathers in chastely voluminous trunks (inevitably, it was men only), gliding around a water-filled barge enclosed by a greenhouse-like structure. Its backers hoped it would be the first in a series of floating baths along the Thames, but it eventually closed in 1884. London still awaits a modern floating lido, unlike Paris, which has the Piscine Joséphine Baker on the Seine.Throughout the Victorian era, social stratification was rigidly enforced, with first- and second-class baths catering for their respective constituencies. Women were generally relegated to laundry duties and rarely had the opportunity to learn to swim. The catastrophic sinking of the pleasure cruiser Princess Alice in the Thames in 1878 pointed up this stark, existential inequality. More than 600 people drowned, most of them female passengers, who would have been non-swimmers, dragged under by their heavy clothing.Underscored by social and economic change, the development of the swimming pool was bound up with urbanisation, progressive reform and the emergence of popular recreation. The rise of mixed bathing and the sexualisation of public culture added a further libidinous frisson. By the time the former war artist Fortunino Matania designed a poster for Southport lido in 1925, depicting long-limbed bathers enjoying sunlit seaside delights, Victorian prudery and drudgery were a distant memory. Ice-cream coloured lidos peppered the English coast, among them Saltdean and Plymouth’s Tinside. A drawing showing the interior of Wembley’s Empire Pool, which opened in 1934 and hosted the 1948 Olympics, evokes a similarly gilded and carefree milieu, featuring spectators in tuxedos and gowns.The exigencies of postwar reconstruction brought the pool back down to earth. Municipal provision and a spirit of egalitarianism flourished, with nearly 200 public baths being built between 1960 and 70. Dollan baths in East Kilbride is typical of the time, its humpback profile inspired by Japanese modernist Kenzo Tange’s National Gymnasium for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.Today, Britain’s public swimming pools must contend with the corrosive impact of local authority budget cuts and the challenge of maintaining ageing buildings. Bon Accord Baths, my watery alma mater, closed in 2008, and has since languished while Aberdeen city council tries to figure out what to do with it. It’s currently on Historic Environment Scotland’s Buildings at Risk Register, and its future is far from assured. As Raymond Chandler pithily observed in The Long Goodbye “nothing ever looks emptier than an empty swimming pool”.But, as the RIBA display shows, more optimistic narratives also prevail. Jubilee Pool in Penzance has just reopened following a refurbishment that will harness geothermal energy to heat part of its pool, enabling all-year-round use. Intended to attract tourists, while also improving things for residents, the remodelling by Scott Whitby Studio includes an expanded cafe, bar and new community hall. Originally designed by borough engineer Captain Frank Latham, Jubilee Pool is a tour de force of seaside art deco, its gleaming white structure resembling an ocean liner anchored at the extreme end of England.As the largest seawater lido in the country, Jubilee Pool is powerfully emblematic of a belief in modernity and the benefits of public recreation. “There can hardly be any better form of bodily exercise than swimming,” proclaimed the mayor of Penzance at its opening in 1935. Paul Valéry put it another way. “It seems to me that I discover and recognise myself when I return to this universal element,” he wrote. “To plunge into water… this is for me a delight only comparable to love.”● Into the Blue: The Origin and Revival of Pools, Swimming Baths and Lidos, Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, London, runs 20 July to 19 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9800ab547d361fa5569de0fcc5b34425731073f2/0_1003_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e4ec8a9b4ea1830bb3b57d867404c4","title":"celebrating rave culture in pictures","story":"From warehouse parties to the acid house explosion, new exhibition Sweet Harmony: Rave Today captures a dancefloor revolution.

Boris Johnson is the kind of guy who’d don Spider-Man pyjamas and scale a building in order to see less of his kids. Sorry, fewer. Even so, he remains a remarkably typical hero of our political times. “There are two kinds of women,” Harry explains at one point in When Harry Met Sally. “High maintenance and low maintenance.” “Which one am I?” Sally asks. “You’re the worst kind,” he says. “You’re high maintenance, but you think you’re low maintenance.”After a week in which paddle-less Britain has found itself once more caught in dangerous transatlantic currents, it’s clear that there are two kinds of political men. Strong men and weak men. Which one is our most likely next prime minister? I’m afraid Boris Johnson is the worst kind: he’s a weak man who thinks he’s a strong man. See also selective antiracist Jeremy Corbyn, whose unshakeable conviction that he hasn’t been wrong in several decades has left him stubbornly incapable of being the bigger person. See also gratefully submissive Donald Trump fanboy Nigel Farage, who has spent much of the past three years hanging wanly around Washington on the off-chance of a half-hour 6pm burger with the alpha male to his beta. And see also Donald Trump himself, the leader of the free world, who spent about 48 hours this week tweeting like some homicidal 11-year-old Justin Bieber fan about the leaked comments of the British ambassador. Who, apparently, we now let him pick. More on toxic insecurity’s poster boy shortly.Back on these shores, the ITV debate between Johnson and his so-called rival Jeremy Hunt was like watching an am-dram version of Amadeus, with Hunt apparently keen to come off as the Salieri to Johnson’s Mozart. It comes as zero consolation that Johnson may, even in the hours before his triumph, already be writing his own funeral music. On this evidence, rather a lot of the country will be in the coffin with him before he’s finished.Poor old Salieri. Almost all of Hunt’s wistfully exasperated attempts to get Johnson to answer a question – any question – could have been replaced with the howl “I speak for all the mediocrities in the world”. Whatever skills Hunt possesses are entirely out of style.It was reportedly after watching Johnson refuse to defend him that US ambassador Kim Darroch made the decision to resign. He had little choice, especially given the way the political winds are blowing. The weak strongmen are inheriting the earth. Johnson has spent weeks claiming he’s the only one strong enough to get the better of the European Union, yet his first public test saw him cravenly submit to the disgraceful whims of Trump. In the circs, it feels a little unfair to class this move as “pussying out”. What would you call it instead? Penising out? Yes, I believe we saw Boris Johnson totally penis out to Donald Trump.During the 2016 presidential election campaign, the Atlantic asked eminent primatologist Jane Goodall to assess Trump. “In many ways the performances of Donald Trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals,” she judged. “In order to impress rivals, males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping, slapping the ground, dragging branches, throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display, the faster the inidual is likely to rise in the hierarchy, and the longer he is likely to maintain that position.” Rather than passing, this political mood has intensified. It is impossible to watch how Farage or Johnson relate to Trump, or each other, or to their own underlings, without imagining the entire evolutionary regression voiced by David Attenborough.Great leaders show, rather than tell, their skills. Yet Johnson never lets up with telling people that he is not “defeatist”, that he will “put some lead in the collective pencil”, that “energy” is needed, that what the EU really fears is a big strong man like him. Mm. I hear they talk of little else in the 27 European capitals. “O Fates, please spare us the dreaded ‘positive energy’ of a guy internationally ridiculed as the worst foreign secretary in memory and the unplayable charm of a surprisingly indifferent orator who knows the Latin for ‘can we just take out the backstop?’”It feels doubly shameful that this gilded overpromotee should have failed to defend Darroch, a scholarship boy who grew up in a council house, but who appears to have drawn rather less self-admiring attention to his own background than Johnson insists upon doing every time his carers let him out. He may use longer words, but Johnson’s sledgehammer self-admiration does not differ materially from the US president’s diurnal reminders that he is a strong, good-looking and very stable genius.In many ways, there can be no greater therapist’s case study than Trump. If – like many of us at times in our lives – you are one of those people who thinks they’d feel better about themselves if they only got that promotion earned more money were more successful in whichever way, then will you just look at this guy. LOOK AT HIM. He’s the actual president of the actual United States of America, and he still spends half his time tweeting on the bog, horrifyingly weakly, about people who should be so far below his sight line as to not even remotely register. What a reminder that it’s really not about how you do externally. Unless you take care of your shit, it’s still there inside, gnawing you to bits, and it never goes away. For all his unrivalled power and immense wealth, Donald Trump is by far and away the most insecure person most of us have ever seen.And it looks like we’re getting our own, small-pond version of him inside of a fortnight. If only alleged strongman Boris Johnson had found some way of taking care of his shit. Instead, we’ll be picking up the tab. Still, I’m sure every Briton will be honoured by the chance to play their small part in the larger story of this one defective, arrogant man. Or, to put it in classical terms we can all understand, the guy who really puts the anus into Coriolanus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18bb2c85745a14f5bfe091f0453a62d89b904fd/152_0_3533_2121/master/3533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7af0782b68b8419afe630d8b7f440d47","title":"love island amy hart teaches himpathy","story":"Amy Hart’s departure from the reality show highlights the excessive sympathy women offer to the men who hurt themYou might be surprised to learn that Love Island is shedding light on contemporary developments in feminist philosophy. You might also be surprised that philosophers are avid watchers of reality television.But the ITV show gives us a unique opportunity to observe the relationships of 20-somethings – from their beginnings to the point where they flourish and, often, break apart. With these glimpses of human behaviour – albeit in the context of a television show – we can get an insight into how many women act, particularly at the end of a relationship.Contestant Amy Hart dramatically left Love Island on Tuesday, after a week of heartbreak. She had been paired with Curtis, only for him to end their relationship – he had “cracked on”, in the show’s parlance, with one contestant and was now being pursued by another.In the face of this, Hart decided to leave, setting aside her own heartbreak to focus on Curtis’s well-being. She declared: “I know you won’t be happy all the time that you will be in here because you’re such a good person. And that’s why I love you so much, and why I want you to be happy. Because you are not going to be happy while I am still here. So I’m leaving.”This interaction is an example of what the Cornell philosopher Kate Manne calls himpathy. She defines it as “the excessive or inappropriate sympathy extended to a male agent or wrongdoer over his female victim”. Granted, wrongdoer and victim are strong words in the case of this Love Island episode, but Manne argues that himpathy leads to an unequal ision of emotional and moral resources – the emotions and perspectives of men are centred and those of women are set to one side.Manne strikingly likens himpathy to the Giving Tree in Shel Silverstein’s children’s book: the tree selflessly and willingly gives away all of its resources to the boy in the story, leaving it a dismembered stump.Manne’s book, Down Girl, was published just before last year’s infamous Brett Kavanaugh case in the US: the nominee to be a judge on the supreme court was accused of sexual misconduct, and when he gave emotional testimony on the historical allegations, he was met with an outpouring of himpathy – in some quarters, drowning out the response to the actual accuser herself. Manne claims we’ve learned to prioritise the men who have been accused of assault over the women who have potentially been victims of it. We could say the same thing of Stanford student swimmer Brock Turner who violently raped an unconscious woman but was only given a six-month prison sentence – because of worries about how a longer sentence might effect his athletic career.What is particularly striking in the Love Island case is the way that many have positively reacted to her display of himpathy:previously Hart had received plenty of abuse on social media, but as soon as she chose to put the feelings of Curtis first, attitudes suddenly shifted.Himpathy is difficult to spot. Women often put the feelings and lives of men before their own and we want to laud such action – it is built in to the emotional character of society that we praise people when they do something deemed selfless. And, yes, perhaps we should think of Hart’s act as a good one. It manifests the virtue of kindness.However, as Manne argues, when we are thinking about himpathy (and misogyny in general), we need to think about the workings of social systems, rather than the actions of iniduals.Hart is in no way in the wrong here but her case simply allows us to ask the question: what happens when women put the feelings of men first?

When pupils at Hague primary school in Bethnal Green, east London, said they wanted to play cricket, there was a problem – the playground had very little space and no grass at all.“It was like a Victorian yard,” recalls headteacher, Judy Coles. So the school built a rooftop playground, complete with concertinaing cricket nets.Coach Soyfur Rahman was 11 when he arrived in England from Bangladesh 15 years ago. He spoke hardly any English and found the transition a “great shock” at first. He remembers with a smile the joy of playing on the roof. “I loved it,” he says. “I was always trying to hit the ball past the nets and off the roof.”He wasn’t the only one – he remembers that when England cricketers Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook visited the school they also tried to hit the ball for six. No wonder the school insisted that a soft ball was used!Cricket helped the 11-year-old to integrate. He had played street cricket in Bangladesh and when he started playing the game at his new school he quickly began to learn English. “I was the only Bengali speaker in the team, so that made me learn English quicker,” says Rahman, who is now 26.“Listening to my teammates I started to pick up words. Thanks to cricket, I learned English quicker than other kids from Bangladesh. It also gave me a lot of confidence.”When the staff noticed that Rahman had a special talent, Coles helped him to get involved with local cricket clubs. He also received coaching from Chance to Shine, the charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through cricket.Rahman credits his success to the coaching courses run by the charity. “They really help coaches to get better and show us how to get the best out of the kids,” he says. “Whatever support I needed, Chance to Shine provided. Then Middlesex hired me to deliver what I’d learned.”He says the charity’s support of young people is transformative, and helps to put them on the right path. “Rather than hanging round on the street, they can play cricket and take a different direction in their lives,” he says.NatWest has been supporting cricket for almost 40 years. It works with Chance to Shine to help create opportunities such as Rahman’s, and keep programmes like this free of charge – something Rahman says is vital.“Among the south-Asian community here, money is a problem. And if you play club cricket the usual way you have to pay for membership, bats, pads, helmet, gloves, bags and shoes. That’s a lot of money, and would be a barrier for many people. But with Chance to Shine projects you don’t need to spend anything. It’s free. You can just turn up, have a game and go home.”For Coles, unearthing and supporting a talent like Rahman’s is life-affirming. Cricket has been her passion since childhood, when she sat at the boundary and proudly watched her grandfather play.She describes it as “an absolute pleasure” to watch children playing team games and developing their skills. “You get children who start not knowing one end of the bat from another and then become good players,” she says. “They develop such confidence.”She also gets parents involved, to make it a family affair. “None of us have great talent, but we have enthusiasm – and we want children to have fun,” she says.Coles says Chance to Shine is “really good at getting cricket into schools, particularly in the inner cities” and believes the charity’s team are “fantastic ambassadors for the game”.With the charity’s support, some of her pupils were invited to open up the London Stock Exchange with cricket legend Devon Malcolm. They have also been taken to see Test matches at Lord’s and the Oval.The school has built a strong cricket culture and the pupils are enthused by the sport – the girls are particularly passionate about the game. “You see them getting involved at lunchtime,” says Coles. “I’m really proud of that.”Rahman thinks that this summer will be the one where cricket really captures the mood of the nation. “With the work Chance to Shine is doing, and the World Cup and Ashes taking place, I think there will be more interest in cricket than ever before,” he says. “That is really positive.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays.

Others had to borrow money from the DfE’s funding arm, throwing into question their long-term viability.Research by the Price Bailey accountancy firm disclosed to the  reveals that 31 out of 40 UTCs with published accounts owe money to the DfE’s education and skills funding agency (ESFA), including 25 schools owing a total of £8.6m after educating fewer pupils than they received funding for through their general annual grant.As a result, UTCs face an uncertain future, despite many being housed in brand-new buildings, including modern science and engineering facilities intended for the surge of pupils who never arrived.“Eight UTCs have already closed and two further closures are imminent, so unless UTCs can boost pupil numbers and performance, more will follow,” said Gary Miller, the head of education at Price Bailey.Wigan UTC is the latest to announce its closure. Parents were told that the decision to shutter the school had been approved by DfE chiefs in June.“The decision to close Wigan UTC has been taken as the UTC is financially unviable. The UTC has been unable to recruit sufficient students to operate without a growing deficit, which will severely hamper the quality of education it can provide moving forward,” the school told parents.Wigan’s closure follows those of Black Country UTC, in Walsall, which attracted just 158 students out of a planned 480, and Burnley UTC, which was expecting 800 students but enrolled only 113 in the three years it was open. Analysis by Schools Week found that £64m was spent on eight UTCs that have closed.The difficulties experienced by UTCs are part of a wider trend of schools having to return overpayments to the ESFA, usually because of lower than expected pupil numbers. In 2016-17, just three academies in England had to return funds to the DfE, but in 2017-18 that figure rose to 50 academies, including UTCs, with nearly £4m returned, according to a freedom of information response.Price Bailey said it had analysed the accounts of 40 of the 50 UTCs operating last year and found that only nine were operating within their budgets, with 31 recording deficits and one or more outstanding debts to the DfE, including 10 owing nearly £4.7m in general loans to cover running costs and three with working capital loans adding up to nearly £1m.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she was concerned that the financial struggles of UTCs were “being hidden in the government’s opaque academies system, with figures concealed from parents and the public”. She said: “Too much money is being wasted on ministers’ vanity projects, and the education system is being fragmented in the process. Labour will end the academy programme and ensure schools are properly accountable, and invest in an integrated education system through our national education service.”As part of Michael Gove’s free schools revolution, UTCs were meant to provide specialist education in science, maths and technology subjects, and attract university and industry backing. But the decision to admit students only from the age of 14 meant that they struggled to compete with secondary schools taking pupils from the age of 12.“The problem with brand-new schools, particularly specialist UTCs, is that they are not tried and tested, which can make parents and pupils wary. Faced with a choice between a new UTC with little or no track record and the local school, which might have served a community for generations, the latter often wins out,” said Miller.A report by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that UTC pupils’ GCSE results were almost a grade lower than similar students at mainstream schools, with the most able students doing even worse. The EPI also found that more than half of UTC students left after taking GCSEs.But while many have struggled, UTC Reading has thrived and is now oversubscribed, having been given an outstanding rating by Ofsted in 2015 and boasting partnerships with Microsoft. Others have been less successful, with five rated as inadequate by Ofsted.A DfE spokesperson said UTCs remained a “key part” of its efforts to improve educational standards. “Funding that is provided to set up new university technical colleges is based on estimates of pupil numbers. Once the school or university technical opens, this funding is then adjusted to reflect actual figures and, where necessary, we work with the institutions to recover funding.“The department continues to support UTCs to be educationally successful and financially viable,” the DfE said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b365c5c6ed55238a31e921e85fa3be2af9e0de8d/8_145_5471_3283/master/5471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ad819fe135f96aacafe1ab086479c6","title":"living walls bloom cities tackle air pollution","story":"When Andrea Carnevali’s son started at St Mary’s Catholic primary school in Chiswick he was alarmed to find that pupils were sometimes kept indoors at break times, despite a large playground.The reason was the nearby six-lane A4 road, which has up to 100,000 vehicles thundering past the school each day. As evidence mounted about the impact of poor air quality on children’s health, the headteacher restricted time outside.Carnevali and other parents decided to take action. Within months they had crowdfunded almost £100,000, and last month a 126-metre “living wall” of 12,000 plants was installed as part of a clean-air initiative at the school. They hope the wall – designed to trap exhaust particles, absorb sound and increase bioersity – will transform one of London’s most polluted schools into one of its greenest.St Mary’s living wall is one of many being installed around the country by local authorities and private developers. Tennis fans may have noticed two enormous living walls flanking the giant outdoor screen at this year’s Wimbledon championships.And they are increasingly a feature of hotel and retail developments. A stunning vertical garden graces Elephant \u0026amp Castle underground station in south London, part of a plan to improve air quality at one of the capital’s busiest road intersections.In a variation on a theme, “living lamp-posts” were installed this month as a trial in Ebury Street in Belgravia, central London. They will be monitored for air quality improvement for a year if the pilot is successful, it could be extended to some of the other estimated 494,000 lamp-posts in central London.In Hull, the council is considering a proposal to transform Whitefriargate, a historic thoroughfare now blighted by empty shops, with vertical gardens.“Demand is definitely growing. There’s been a steady rise in interest over the past two years, and a noticeable increase since the beginning of this year,” said Calvin Dalrymple, a living wall consultant with ANS Global, one of the country’s leading suppliers, and the creator of St Mary’s living wall.“It’s being mainly driven by local authorities, but also a greater awareness in the private sector of the need for sustainable architecture.” According to Benz Kotzen of the Green Roofs and Living Walls Centre at the University of Greenwich, “we need every tool to try to improve things, and there just isn’t enough capacity in urban environments to create green infrastructure at ground level.“It’s no longer good enough to have a building facade that just keeps out the weather. In the future, building facades will need to be much more functional – cleaning the air, collecting energy and improving bioersity.”Vertical gardens could also be used to grow food, he said, adding that herbs, strawberries, tomatoes and rocket did particularly well.Living walls range from simple wire structures to support climbing plants to sophisticated modular systems, using soil or hydroponic manmade substrate, and solar-powered irrigation. The cost ranges from £200 to £800 per square metre.The main challenge with maintenance was working at height, said Kotzen. “Growing plants vertically is no more difficult than horizontally, but all gardens need maintaining.”Not everyone is a fan of the trend towards vertical gardens. “They’re not a solution, except for the wealthy,” said Mick Crawley, professor of plant ecology at Imperial College London. “There are much cheaper and more effective ways of improving air quality.” Local authorities struggling to pay for essential services would be better advised to plant trees, he said.London’s first living wall, installed in 2005 by Islington council at a children’s centre at a cost of £100,000, withered and died within four years after the irrigation system failed.“Living walls will die if they’re not designed properly and maintained,” said Dalrymple. “There are four key things to longterm sustainability: correct water management, correct substrate, maintenance and plant selection taking into account shade, wind and elevation.”With between 28,000 and 36,000 deaths in the UK each year attributed by Public Health England to long-term exposure to air pollution, living walls are expected to become more common. But the benefits go beyond improvements to air quality.Lucy Dunhill, who is behind the Hull proposal, said: “Visually, Whitefriargate is very depressing, with boarded-up shopfronts and very bad acoustics. Your eyes are not drawn up, you keep your head down when you walk along Whitefriargate.”Her green walls plan will, she hopes, “become an attraction in itself as well as improving the environment”.Andy Wayro, landscape design manager at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, said its living walls were aesthetically pleasing, had reduced noise and connected people to nature. “The feedback from players and the general public has been really positive,” he said.At St Mary’s in Chiswick, children have been planting a section of the wall with wild strawberries, thyme, rosemary, sage and lavender, using wooden markers to allow them to monitor growth.“The children adore it, and so do the teachers,” said Carnevali. “Apart from any environmental benefits, they say it makes them happier and calmer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4fc6ef864e59358e7078107d3b00d868719474/0_370_5737_3442/master/5737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb1dcbe15bfb874c7b6298df0003c47","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"This week: Hungary’s insect of 2019, and bluehead wrasse courtship and sex change"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7c706af1edb0a7021d02c908ed296e84e06e792/0_473_3723_2233/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1427ab3889420502b78e5bcdb21ee12d","title":"dosa coconut chutney and greens vegan recipe meera sodha","story":"Dosas are an addictive Indian snack that take a while to prepare. But add buckwheat to the mix, and they become a quick, fuss-free treatI don’t go out for Indian food much, but when I do, it is for one of two reasons: exceptional cooking or dosas.Dosas haven’t historically been a home cook’s friend, and I understand why. Few hungry people can wait a day for the batter to rest. But when buckwheat is introduced, the game changes: suddenly, dosas can be made in a matter of minutes, not days. For that reason, they’ve become one of my favourite reasons to stay in.This dish consists of three separate elements: the dosa batter, the coconut chutney and the vegetable filling. If you’d rather not tackle all three at the same time, ditch the greens entirely and ide the spiced oil between the chutney mix and the batter instead. Have faith in the buckwheat dosas, too: the key to success is to make them in a nonstick pan on a very high heat – it needs to be very hot indeed – and make sure you leave them to crisp up properly before even thinking about flipping them with a spatula. The first pancake will inevitably fail – such is the universal law of pancakes – so make it a small one, so as not to waste too much batter.100g desiccated coconutSalt180g buckwheat flour6 tbsp oil, plus extra for brushing12 fresh curry leaves1 tbsp cumin seeds1 tbsp black mustard seeds3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced2cm ginger, peeled and finely chopped2 ½ green finger chillies, finely chopped400g chard, leaves shredded, stalks roughly chopped200g frozen peas, defrostedPut the desiccated coconut in a heatproof bowl with a third of a teaspoon of salt, cover with 275ml boiling water and leave to soak.Meanwhile, put the buckwheat flour in another bowl with half a teaspoon of salt. Slowly pour in 450ml water, mix to a thin batter, then set aside.Put the oil in a nonstick frying pan and get it really hot, then add the curry leaves, cumin, mustard seeds, garlic, ginger and chillies, and fry for two to three minutes, until the garlic turns a pale gold. Carefully tip into a heatproof bowl to cool. Keep the pan for later.When the spiced oil has cooled, stir two tablespoons of it into both the coconut mix and the batter. Tip the coconut into a blender and blitz until really smooth (add a little more water, if need be).Reheat the frying pan over a high heat and, when hot, add the rest of the oil and spice mix, followed by the chard stalks. Fry, stirring, for three minutes, then add the leaves and cook until wilted. Throw in the peas, cook for a couple of minutes, until everything is nice and hot, then stir through a couple of tablespoons of the coconut chutney. Scrape out into a serving dish, wipe the pan clean with kitchen paper and put back on the heat.Once the pan is really hot, brush the surface with a fine layer of oil. Add a small ladleful of batter and swirl it into a thin layer – a few gaps and bubbles are fine, because they can help the dosa get crisp. Cook the dosa for two minutes, until the edges are visibly crisp and browning, then gently lever up with a spatula, flip and cook for a further two minutes on the other side, before turning it out on to a plate. Repeat with the remaining batter, oiling the pan between each dosa.Serve the dosas with the greens and remaining chutney on the side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6392feadcab885a7909b9515eabf41c037a16006/0_221_3723_2233/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a772cf392074a6b2d6d3c07e61b83aef","title":"yotam ottolenghi tomato cucumber freekeh tabbouleh summer salad recipes","story":"Tomato and cucumber are the chameleon salad ingredients, providing a backdrop for everything from citrus and spice to Asian dressings and Middle Eastern tabboulehWhenever I hear the word “salad”, I always think chopped salad. Specifically, the kind I had almost every day while growing up, which was based on two much-loved ingredients: tomato and cucumber.What makes them (together or apart) the building blocks of just about all summer salads across the eastern Mediterranean is that, at their best, they require nothing but a splash of olive oil to give a concentrated dose of freshness.They also meld exceptionally well with other ingredients – from nutty freekeh and cooling yoghurt to creamy tahini – to make some seriously complex dishes for any sunny meal.Properly ripe, wonderfully sweet tomatoes should simply be put on a pedestal and left to be enjoyed and admired. The second-best thing you can do with them is to make a salad. This one combines sweet, sour and salty notes, and is best served with warm bread to scoop up the tomatoes and soak up their juices.Prep 15 minCook 5 minServes 4 as a side70g Greek-style yoghurt50g soft, rindless goat’s cheese½ small garlic clove, peeled and crushedSalt1-2 limes – zest finely grated, to get 1 tsp, and juiced, to get 1½ tbsp 15 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds finely crushed in a mortar 1 large green chilli, finely chopped (pith and seeds removed if you prefer less heat)500g ripe, sweet cherry tomatoes, halved (or any other great tomatoes you can get)1 large banana shallot, peeled and finely sliced 60ml olive oil10g mint leaves, roughly tornMix the yoghurt, goat’s cheese, garlic and a pinch of salt in a large bowl until smooth. Add half the lime zest, half the cardamom and half the chilli, and stir to combine. Set aside an eighth of a teaspoon of the remaining crushed cardamom, to serve.In a second bowl, mix the tomatoes, shallot, lime juice, two tablespoons of oil and half a teaspoon of salt with the remaining lime zest, cardamom and chilli. Add the yoghurt mixture and most of the mint, and stir gently, but not too much – you want still to be able to see the red of the tomatoes and green of the mint in parts.Transfer to a platter, drizzle with the remaining two tablespoons of oil, finish with the remaining mint and cardamom, and serve.This non-traditional tabbouleh has a higher proportion of grain to herbs than normal and uses freekeh instead of bulgur these adaptations make it heartier and more substantial. By all means use bulgur, if you prefer, but if you do go with freekeh, use the cracked kind, rather than the wholegrain variety, which takes much longer to cook.To get ahead, cook the freekeh up to a day ahead, but assemble the salad only just before serving. I like this with roast chicken or grilled halloumi, but it can also form part of a meze spread.Prep 15 minCook 35 minCool 30 minServes 4 as a side75ml olive oil4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed150g cracked freekeh¾ tsp ground allspice½ tsp ground cinnamonSalt and black pepper1½ cucumbers (500g), deseeded and cut into ¼cm-thick half-moons (350g net weight)1 small red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced 2 tbsp cider vinegar30g parsley leaves, roughly chopped20g mint leaves, roughly torn2 tbsp lemon juice1 tsp sumacPut a tablespoon and a half of the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat.

Add 270ml water, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, turn the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat, then leave to sit, still covered, for another 15 minutes. Remove the lid and leave for about 30 minutes, to cool completely.Put the cucumber, onion, vinegar and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt into a large bowl and toss to combine.

It’s tremendously popular with Ottolenghi chefs for its big flavours based on a brazenly liberal use of chillies, vinegar, soy sauce and oil. Its cucumber salad, which always appears first on the table, is the loose inspiration for this dish. The dressing can be made up to a week ahead and kept refrigerated – just stir again to loosen it, adding a little water, if need be.Prep 10 minCook 10 minMarinate 2 hrServes 4 as a side700g cucumbers (ie, roughly 2 large cucumbers), quartered lengthways2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tsp rice-wine vinegar3 tbsp lime juice3 tsp flaked sea salt3 tbsp sunflower oil2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced on an angle½ tbsp black sesame seedsFor the dressing60g tahini2 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari, to make the dish gluten-free)1½ tbsp mirin1½ tbsp rice-wine vinegarScoop out and discard the watery centre and seeds from the cucumber quarters, then cut the flesh widthways into chunky, 2cm-thick pieces.

It had just gone 1pm on Friday when his legal representative arrived at the headquarters of La Liga wheeling a silver suitcase into the building, where he deposited the €120m (£107.6m) buyout clause that releases the striker from his contract, five years after his arrival. Barcelona confirmed the transfer two hours later.Griezmann’s new deal will run for five years and contains a buyout clause – a legal stipulation in Spain – worth €800m. For all the twists in the plot, the crossed words and accusations, this signing had been set up from the start. It was only going to end one way and if it took longer than expected it was concluded when Griezmann’s lawyer, Sevan Karian, arrived at La Liga’s HQ – although Atlético say that €120m is not enough, claiming the true value to be €200m.The clause dropped to €120m at the start of this month but Barcelona had hoped to reach a negotiated settlement rather than be forced to pay up front in one go. Atlético refused, publicly accusing Barcelona and the Frenchman of a lack of respect in a statement that also demanded he report for training last Sunday. This was despite Atlético requesting he record a video announcing his intention to leave on 14 May, despite Griezmann not having had his statutory 30 days’ holiday and despite their using the money to sign João Félix for €126m, handing him Griezmann’s No 7 shirt.Griezmann will now report for training on Monday – in Barcelona. Luis Suárez and Lionel Messi will not be there but how well he fits with them will be crucial to his success at the Camp Nou.It is not entirely clear where he does fit – his natural playing position is the same as Messi’s – and there have been some suggestions those two would prefer to see Neymar come back from Paris Saint‑Germain.There has been a sense of unease at Barcelona returning to a player who so publicly rejected them 13 months ago. After the ignominious Champions League defeat at Anfield, though, most of their followers will celebrate this signing. It is one they have chased for a while.Barcelona first approached Griezmann last year, aware that his buyout clause would temporarily drop to €100m. They were prepared to pay that sum, unilaterally releasing him from his contract, and reached an agreement on personal terms. That left Griezmann’s future in his own hands and his deliberations became the focus of a documentary called La Decisión where – in soft focus and stylish shots – he can be seen agonising over what decision to make: stay or go?1 Neymar, Barcelona to PSG, 2017, £200.6m2 Kylian Mbappé Monaco to PSG, 2017, £128m\u0026nbsp3 Antoine Griezmann, Atlético Madrid to Barcelona, 2019, £107.6m4 Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool to Barcelona, 2018, £106.4m\u0026nbsp5 Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid to Juventus, 2018, £99.2m\u0026nbsp6 Ousmane Dembélé, Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, 2017, £96.8m7 Paul Pogba, Juventus to Manchester United, 2016, £89m\u0026nbsp8 Gareth Bale, Tottenham to Real Madrid, 2013, £85.3m\u0026nbsp9 Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United to Real Madrid, 2009, £80m\u0026nbsp10\u0026nbspGonzalo Higuaín, Napoli to Juventus, 2016, £75.3mOver 30 minutes, the audience is given glimpses of Griezmann contemplating his future, looking pensive at the dinner table, pensive playing basketball, pensive in a plane and pensive on a horse.“I don’t know what to do,” he says often but at the end of the film, shown a year ago on Sunday, he finally announces his decision to stay at Atlético. He called Barcelona to apologise: their board did not know the documentary was being made, even though the production company belongs in part to Gerard Piqué, their centre-half.Griezmann signed an improved deal at Atlético, worth €20m a year after tax, but that was far from definitive: the new contract included a €200m buyout clause but it would again drop on 1 July – explicitly allowing for an exit, should the player want one, and inviting suitors to line up once more. Once they had the signal, they did just that.Griezmann may not have regretted renewing, staying for another season, but he soon decided that he did want to depart and so the deal was picked up again, 12 months on, and for €20m more. The same amount Atlético had spent paying him last season.Ultimately, his season was a disappointing one, which plays its part in his leaving. Atlético had strengthened the team in an attempt to convince him to remain and they again finished ahead of Real Madrid in La Liga, but that was not enough.Legacy looms large in the documentary, Griezmann acutely aware that any history made at Atlético would be his, while success elsewhere would be shared. But that requires success in the first place and it did not come. He admitted that living in Messi’s shadow had been a factor in choosing to stay then, but he has thought again. There is a parallel to Neymar’s departure to PSG, the Brazilian’s realisation that playing with Messi may cast more light than shadow.The season was defined above all by the Champions League: the primary focus of the documentary, Atlético’s obsession and the competition whose final would be held at their Wanda politano. That became a target and, by extension, a kind of watershed, too – it is almost as if the Frenchman was convinced, like some kind of crime caper, to do one last job, their biggest yet.It did not work out and it does not feel like chance that, if Atlético’s allegations are to be believed – and his new club will not recognise this – Griezmann had agreed to join Barça in the days after Atlético lost to Juventus in the last 16.There was still a long way to go and there may be arguments ahead even now, but essentially it was done. On 14 May, Griezmann recorded a video on a phone saying he was leaving, but he did not say where he was going. He could not and he did not tell them either, although Atlético claimed they knew.All that was left to do was wait for the buyout clause value to drop, the way it had been designed to do. Thirteen days later, cameras caught a man strolling into a building carrying €120m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89345614da2c62b933276ca8227ff6ca9fa23269/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fd3fb87240d8e149d7e9b2d490bc8f2","title":"blind date summer mark","story":"What were you hoping for?I was told he was a cyclist, so nice legs.What did you talk about?Berlin, philosophy and acid communism.Any awkward moments?No olives on the menu.Good table manners?He smeared food all over his face it was appalling.

It suggests the minimum amount will vary depending on how old someone is, and the paper will give advice on “sleep hygiene”, according to the Times, which obtained the document.It was reported the guidance was likely to state regularly getting less than seven hours’ sleep a night could damage most people’s health.The leaked draft says: “This is with a view to informing the case for clear national guidance on the daily recommended hours of sleep for iniduals in different age brackets, and to raise awareness of the key ‘sleep hygiene’ factors that can support healthy sleeping.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said it did not comment on leaks.Hancock is due to to publish a public health green paper as part of efforts to improve disease prevention.

I’ve probably missed someone!My first memory as a conscious person is being outside my house. There’s a load of kids across the road and they’re all dressed as the Lone Ranger, which was a huge show at the time. My neighbourhood was a lively place! Anywhere I’ve ever gone in my life I’ve been able to assimilate and get along with people. I attribute that all to the environment I grew up in. I might have grown up in poverty, but New York gave me many riches. New York is who I am.Disco was such an exciting time to live within. We were all united. There was no ision. The women’s liberation movement paired with the gay liberation movement. Whites and blacks. We were all united, by music. God knows how it looked in the Midwest.The Disco Sucks movement, where they held big events and burned our records, was racism. It wasn’t about them not liking the music they were scared of the societal change that disco was bringing about. It got really weird when they tried to pit Chic against the Knack in a race for a number one single. They framed it as “disco vs rock”. Even though we used the same studio, saw each other every day, and were good friends – and their song My Sharona was about one of our friends, Sharona!David Bowie was an inspiration to me. I’ve worked with everyone: Madonna, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan. But David Bowie really was fantastic. In truth, people hardly ever approach me to work with them. Pretty much everything comes from hanging out and chance meetings. Whenever me and Bowie would meet, we’d always end up talking about jazz. Really strange avant-garde jazz. He loved that stuff and he was such an ally for black rights. He was a fantastic human.Music and science were my twin loves growing up. I guess music just spoke to me that little bit more, and so it became my life. But I’m still absolutely fascinated by science. Space is something I’m consumed by. What are we? How did we get here? I’m lucky that I know people at Nasa and the like, so I get invited to all sorts of conferences and big scientific gatherings.I became friends with Stephen Hawking. His brain was enormous, and he was a total genius, but not enough people talk about how funny he was. He was one of the funniest men I’ve ever met. Was he a fan of Chic? I don’t know. I presume so. I never asked. It’s not like he ever asked me if I was a fan of his theorems, you know?I accidentally invented hip-hop. I remember the first time I heard Rapper’s Delight by the Sugarhill Gang. I was in a nightclub in New York called Leviticus and the DJ was playing a record that opened with the bassline from the Chic song Good Times. At first I thought they were playing it live in the DJ booth and I was really impressed. Then the DJ told me he’d bought the record that day in Harlem. I asked to see the sleeve, and when our name wasn’t on there, things got legal. It’s an amazing song though, and I’m really proud of our part in it.

So why did I encourage him to have more? We were enjoying a final barbecue with our two younger children on the last night of a holiday in Cornwall. Earlier we had dropped Jake, our 16-year-old, at the station so he could go home for a party. What we didn’t know, as we watched another dazzling sunset, was that the party was at our house. Jake was the host. And it had been flagged on social media for more than a week.Skip to the next day. We were driving home when we received an ominous phone call from Jake: “I’m really sorry,” he said, “but Josh broke the overhead light in the kitchen skateboarding round the table.”There were several things wrong with this statement. But, most alarmingly, why were Jake and his friend in the house, which we had locked up and fully secured before going on holiday? Within five minutes of arriving home it became clear that he’d had a Facebook party. A gathering for 25 mates – his story, anyway – had turned into a bacchanalian bash for 200.The carpets were ruined, almost turned black with footprints. There were alarming drops of blood on the walls, which were also filthy, and a cupboard door had been wrenched off its hinges. No room was left undamaged.“Someone’s slept in my bed,” my 13-year-old daughter called from upstairs, furious.“There are cigarette burns on the sofa,” said the eight-year-old, thrilled, as he ran from room to room inspecting the wreckage.There was worse to come. A precious Gurkha’s knife belonging to my husband John’s late father was missing, a bike had been stolen and surrounding the house was a sea of smashed beer bottles. We were picking up fragments of glass for weeks.We live in an ancient farmhouse. It’s withstood centuries of pillaging and plundering, and can more than cope with a crowd of drunk teens. What bothered us – aside from the deceit – was what could have gone wrong, without any adults on hand to pick up the pieces. We have a thatched roof – no need to spell out the risks there. What if someone had needed to go to A\u0026ampE, a 45-minute drive away? Or a kid had fallen asleep and – my personal terror when teenagers are involved – choked on their vomit?To be fair, Jake was distraught. The party had quickly raged out of control. He’d watched in horror as people he didn’t know charged upstairs, ignoring his pleas that it was out of bounds. He said he’d hated the whole night, and we believed him (although it must be said, his timing was immaculate he started sixth form with street cred intact).We confiscated his phone, which was humming with texts (“Sick party” was the gist) and banned him from going out for a few weeks. But we couldn’t gate him for ever and, eventually, we had to make a decision about what to do next.In the following weeks, we’d overhear the odd phone call, along the chilling lines of “so-and-so’s got a free house”. We knew Jake wouldn’t put us through a Facebook party again, but how was he going to see his friends? When you live in the sticks, as we do, there are few places for teenagers to go. Chances are they are going to see their friends and get drunk anyway, and they need a safe place to do it.Taking a somewhat different approach, we decided to be the safe place. Full-on parties at home were off the agenda instead we told our son he could have small gatherings, provided we were both present.“Are you crazy?” our friends said. “Look what happened last time.”But we went ahead, and here’s the thing: over the next two years we got to know Jake’s circle of friends pretty well. They would crash at our house after a party – six of them squeezed into his bedroom – and more often than not our house was the party. Weekends became a mishmash of Butterflies meets Skins.To help make it work, we established some unbreakable rules. The gathering must be banished to one room as far away from our bedroom as possible no smoking inside no drugs. (Oh yes, the thorny issue of drugs. I am grateful that John’s job as a festival promoter gives him the inside track on the worst drugs doing the rounds – things with numbers rather than names: 2CB anyone? – so we aren’t clueless, but having your teenager partying under your roof gives you an unrivalled opportunity to look into their eyes. If something was going on, we’d have known about it.)And here’s another thing you learn when you see your kids’ friends slightly pissed, guard down: they really care for each other. If someone’s throwing up, they will be looked after. If one of them is having a bad time, a friend will take them home. If there’s a relationship trauma, they will not be crying alone.Jake is now at university and recently he invited the old crowd around for a reunion. We were genuinely thrilled to see them. They cooked and sat around the table drinking wine - how things change in the space of three years. Getting to know our children’s friends has given us an insight into the modern teenager they are kind, funny, intelligent and polite. And they are welcome any time. Here’s six things we learned.1 Never leave your house emptyDon’t be tempted to allow your teenager to have a gathering while you’re away, however small and “safe” he or she says it will be. I have friends with teenagers who book a housesitter rather than leave the place unguarded – some teenagers live for an empty house. Always remember that after a few beers, sense, logic and the moral compass tend to go out of the window (one friend had a new car smashed up at an illicit teenage party). And if you need to farm them out, make sure it’s to an adult you genuinely know and can check in with. Beware the unknown parent’s email: it may well be a fake.2 Get to know your child’s friendsThis might sound obvious, but it’s surprisingly easy to lose sight of your kid’s friends once they start at secondary school. Allowing your house to become the party place (with strict boundaries) once in a while means you see them in a much more relaxed setting. Without exception, we’ve found them to be lovely. Plus, you get to prowl your terrain from time to time to see what’s going down. Literally.3 Ban social media invitesSocial media can get out of control fast, and if strangers or friends of friends begin to turn up, no amount of rule-setting will save you. Instead, set a limit of 10-15 friends, which is a manageable number.4 Treat it as a giant sleepoverIt’s easiest to allow everyone to stay, especially if transport links are weak (and few parents relish a 1am pick-up). They will happily crash on floors, sofas, chairs or the back of their car. And, talking of cars, if you have them to stay you don’t have the worry of late-night dangerous driving.5 Hide valuables (booze included)I’m still smarting from the loss of an unopened bottle of rhubarb gin, a birthday present, which was handed out freely as shots at one gathering. We move anything we care about, such as good glasses, put throws on sofas and cloths on tables. I learned the hard way that wet beer bottle tops leave nasty marks on surfaces.6 The key ingredients are beer, pizza and baconMostly they want to drink beer and it does seem to be the best option: the time they drank Jägermeister wasn’t pretty. Pizza at any time of day or night goes down in industrial quantities. Same goes for breakfast the next morning.

The gig had barely been announced before Young issued a statement via his website, decrying the show as “a massive fuck-up” and declining to take part at all unless somebody did something about its sponsor, Barclays, “a fossil-fuel funding entity”. Evidently rattled – the promoters were presumably expecting something more along the lines of how much he was looking forward to seeing his fans and rockin’ London – Barclays’ name and the British Summer Time branding was discreetly dropped, the gig went ahead, but notice had been served: age has not rendered two of the most unbiddable figures in rock history any more biddable.The usual sense of trepidation attended Neil Young’s performance – he’s still entirely capable of making such an unyielding racket onstage that people feel impelled to write letters of complaint to the national press, as happened in Ireland during his 2012 tour with Crazy Horse – but he seems in uncharacteristically crowd-pleasing mood. His set is largely drawn from 1990’s Ragged Glory, the album that cemented his reputation as the godfather of grunge, and his biggest seller, 1972’s Harvest: its controversial track Alabama making a reappearance, presumably as a result of the state’s recent abortion ban. He rolls out the hits – Heart of Gold, Like a Hurricane – and curtails his penchant for onstage jamming to accommodate an hour and a half set time.Songs that have been known to last weeks in their live versions – Love and Only Love, Words – zip by: only a concluding Rockin’ in the Free World is extended, with a succession of false endings. He leaves the stage smiling.Enter Bob Dylan, eager as ever to demonstrate that when it comes to unbiddable live performances, the boss is in town. It’s an article of faith among his devotees that his gigs represent astonishing nightly feats of musical reinvention, in which a consummate artist presents his oeuvre not as a back catalogue carved in stone but a kind of living entity, constantly shifting and changing according to his mood, and that anyone who disagrees belongs in the dunces’ corner alongside the guy who shouted “Judas!” at him in 1966: entire books have been written on the subject, in which the changing emphases placed on certain words during different performances of All Along the Watchtower are discussed in depth and his between-song utterances – if he’s in a particularly garrulous mood you might get a “Hello” – are compiled and pored over for deeper meanings.For the less committed, watching him live is as baffling and frustrating experience as money can buy, in which his voice – now a ruined phlegmy gurgle – and apparently unquenchable desire to redecorate his material with completely different melodies to the ones he originally wrote mean that every new number brings with it a heated debate as to which song he’s actually performing, the debates occasionally going on longer than the song itself. Tonight, both factions seem well represented: the true believers are going nuts at everything he does equally there’s a steady stream of people leaving long before he quits the stage.At risk of sounding equivocal, you can see both sides of the argument: there are moments when songs spark into new life – not least Like a Rolling Stone, its old sneering anger replaced by a world-weary melancholy, its tune intact enough to provoke an audience singalong – and moments when you have literally no clue what’s going on up there and wonder if anyone does outside of Dylan and his band, the latter clearly drilled to perfection on their boss’s foibles: “Oh my God, this is Make You Feel My Love” cries out a voice in the crowd midway through his most famous latterday composition, a tender ballad of love that he’s somehow succeeded in transforming into something weirdly menacing.For his part, Dylan appears to be having an absolute whale of time: he unexpectedly keeps grinning at the audience and at one point quits the piano to strike a series of vaguely Elvis-ish poses at the microphone. But then, why wouldn’t he? A sizeable proportion of the audience adores him, another chunk evidently has no idea what he thinks he’s playing at, which, for Dylan, amounts to unbiddable business as usual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddfc1071bcd035f01ecf90187b9575e50248c47e/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35ab9be787b8854ab89556ee622b0996","title":"thom yorke live paris philharmonie review","story":"Grande salle Pierre Boulez, Philharmonie de ParisDancing like no one’s watching, with club beats bubbling under, Yorke brings a happy, dreamy dimension to his solo tourAn enthusiastic amateur for years, Thom Yorke’s career as a dancer really took off in 2011. Back then, Radiohead – the band for whom he still acts as frontman – released a song called Lotus Flower from their eighth album, The King of Limbs.That album title, you suspect now, refers not just to a tree, but to Yorke’s own arms and legs. The song’s accompanying video was widely praised, and much remixed, for the fact that Yorke – a slight white Englishman in his 40s – was dancing like no one was watching to some high-concept choreography. It confirmed Yorke as a maker of music for bodies, not just for brains. He seemed, emphatically, like a guy who does yoga.Radiohead made their reputation as a cerebral outfit, first as a rock band, and later as a digitally enhanced avant garde remix of a rock band. Yorke’s voice has been a frequently elliptical one. But tonight in Paris, Yorke the dancer is unchained once again, pacing the stage, making eye contact, frequently enacting his music’s organic metamorphoses with elegant convulsions, or its lyrics with a wave here, a gesture there.He is joined on stage by producer Nigel Godrich on keys, bass, guitar and atmospheres, and visual artist Tarik Barri, who live-mixes abstract projections. There are ink blots in milk, mechanised amoebas, iron filing mountains collapsing, and bars of neon colour that gently suggest In Rainbows, the Radiohead album of 2007. We are in a would-be rave, of sorts, in a spectacular modernist concert hall aptly named after Pierre Boulez, the avant garde French composer who, in the second half of his career, experimented with electronic music.Just two weeks ago, Yorke released his third solo album, Anima (his fourth, if you’re counting 2013’s Amok by Atoms for Peace, a non-Radiohead outing with Flea and Joey Waronker). Anima’s release was accompanied by a three-song Netflix “one-reeler” directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, in which Yorke’s commitment to dance was made even more blatant.Somewhere between an extended music video and a performance piece, the film stars Yorke as a sleepy commuter alongside similarly attired workers. The initial sequence, in which Yorke and the corps try to stop themselves nodding off, is a thing of wonder – choreography brilliantly transposed from real-life movements. Even better, the film’s principal dystopian vision is undercut by more physical comedy and emotional intimacy than you might expect from the often lugubrious Yorke: another sequence finds Yorke and his real-life partner, the Italian actor Dajana Roncione, vertically rolling over one another, touching foreheads.Only when Yorke is dancing, you suspect, can he feel this free. Tonight, during Not the News – one of eight tracks Yorke plays from Anima – Yorke goes through the “slap myself awake” movements to a huge cheer. At other times, he waves distantly, notably during Nose Grows Some from Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes – the 2014 album from which this ongoing fits-and-starts tour takes its name (it began in 2017). Yorke shakes like a leaf, bounds from console to console, looping his own keening. He seems, within the context of his anxious, racked music, very happy.It is not difficult to love Yorke. He is the Old Testament prophet of British music, a man who turned his back on the prospect of conventional ubiquity after Radiohead’s OK Computer, performing a left-field handbrake turn instead. Kid A introduced great swaths of the rock audience to open-ended digital music. Yorke has never looked back, exploring textures and dynamics derived from club culture, alongside glitchy digitals and dubstep bass frequencies over the course of a 15-year parallel solo career.The 2015 breakup of his 23-year relationship to Rachel Owen made Yorke seem more like an ordinary mortal than previously her death in 2018 will have added a deeper resonance to Yorke’s already emotionally intelligent music. In a recent interview, however, Yorke railed against obvious biographical interpretations of his work. Even unanchored from biography, Anima’s standout ballad, Dawn Chorus, is spectacularly moving, with Yorke reckoning with time past. The song itself has been knocking around as an unfinished bootleg for a while it lent its name to the company Radiohead set up in 2015 in the run-up to the release of A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).Tonight, the set list rightly focuses on Anima, which takes its name from the Italian for soul, but also for the Jungian concept of femininity within the masculine more generally, it is concerned with sleep and dream states. “I must be asleep,” sings Yorke on the icy, minimal house-inflected (Ladies \u0026amp Gentlemen, Thank You for Coming).But Yorke is an artist well aware of external realities. In all his incarnations, he has been perpetually alert to misdeeds by the powerful and the impending climate apocalypse. Recently, when blackmailed by a leaker, Radiohead donated the proceeds of hours of OK Computer outtakes to Extinction Rebellion.His solo song Harrowdown Hill, off 2006’s The Eraser, comes early on tonight, in an unsettling funk-adjacent version. It serves as a reminder that the parlous state of politics wasn’t actually that much better back then, when the apparent suicide of the scientist Dr David Kelly (who found that Iraq was not manufacturing weapons of mass destruction) inspired one of Yorke’s clearest songs.But the dream state prevails tonight. If there’s an enduring criticism of Yorke’s flag-bearing for the digital sphere, it is that his music tends to avoid resolution: there are smears over washes, wailing looped over atmospheres, sometimes to little obvious purpose. You’re often hard-pressed to spot the development of a motif, because a number of ideas just sit alongside each other, not really interacting. So whenever something pierces the wishy-washy fug, you want to cheer: Default, by Atoms for Peace, features both earwax-loosening bass and dynamism.Although the set never satisfyingly erupts into out-and-out rave dynamics, one of the peaks finds Yorke and Godrich deploying sub-bass wub-wubs and cascades of digital percussion. The punishing sonics of Traffic, a recent song off Anima, turn into the strobing finale of the same album’s Twist. There are points, too, where you can detect an echo of a house piano, or the palest impression of soul. Unexpectedly, Runwayaway recalls the constituent parts of Donna Summer’s I Feel Love with Godrich’s bubbling amniotic atmospheres redolent of Giorgio Moroder’s famous bassline.A bard for our anxious times, Yorke has talked about his own troublesome internal weather and it seems likely that succour, for him, lies within the body, in movement.On Suspirium, the final song of two encores, from the film score of the same name, one lyric stands out. “This is a waltz,” Yorke sings, “Thinking about our bodies What they mean for our salvation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6966053bb26eb4c7d98634b8c04d01ae5ef892b/4_173_1362_817/master/1362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1bf2a8d93867b9fb1a3ab6f207dcbd0","title":"why do light skinned women dominate the pop charts","story":"From K-pop stars to Beyoncé, the issue of colourism remains rife in the music industryIt seems every conversation about colourism in pop music must come back to Beyoncé. So it was when Mathew Knowles, record exec, former Destiny’s Child manager and Beyoncé’s father, appeared on SiriusXM radio to discuss research by Texas Southern University, where he is a visiting professor. Their study found that over a 15-year period it was lighter-skinned black women – the likes of Alicia Keys, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey and, of course, Beyoncé – who dominated Top 40 airplay. When asked how different Beyoncé’s career would have been had she been darker-skinned, Knowles was unequivocal: “I think it would’ve affected her success.”Indeed, Beyoncé descends, via her mother’s line, from Louisiana’s “Creoles of color” or “gens de couleur libres”, a distinct ethnic group in 17th- and 18th-century America, who developed from unions between Europeans and Africans and held privileged positions in society, relative to enslaved Africans. Beyoncé celebrated this heritage on her track Formation, and while Creoles of colour lost their favourable social status from the early 19th century onwards, a shade-based caste system, with whiteness at its apex, persists to this day.That historical context seems to have been lost, however, in some contemporary music industry conversations, which reframe the issue as the light-skinned star’s struggle for acceptance. “There’s colourism involved in the black community, which is very apparent,” said R\u0026ampB-pop singer Tinashe in 2017. “It’s about trying to find a balance where I’m a mixed woman, and sometimes I feel like I don’t fully fit into the black community they don’t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman.”So you’d be forgiven for assuming that Identity Crisis, the new colourism-confronting pop single by light-skinned Dominican-Brazilian Jarina De Marco, would be more of the same. In fact, the song takes a step back to offer some structural analysis of the issue. With lyrics such as “Marry fair  Stay out of the sun  Bleach your skin  Isn’t this fun?”, De Marco satirises how white supremacist beauty standards are passed down by the cosmetics industry and within our own families.“Look at someone like Beyoncé,” says Lao Ra, a Colombia-born, UK-based pop singer, who appears in Identity Crisis’s accompanying short film, Conversations on Colourism. “Don’t get me wrong, she’s a talent like no other, but her physical appearance perhaps played a small role in her initial mainstream appeal.”Like De Marco, Lao Ra also acknowledges her own light-skinned privilege. “Perhaps I have the right amount of ‘exoticism’. It plays in my favour, I suppose, but in the major scheme of things it sucks that relatability comes from how light or dark you are rather than the music you’re making.”There are a handful of artists of mixed African-American and Korean heritage who have made Korean-language songs about racism, such as rapper Yoon Mi-rae’s Black Happiness, but colourism is much more widely practised and much less openly challenged. Witness the numerous YouTube clips of boybands EXO and BTS teasing supposedly darker members or pointedly applying high-factor sun cream. Allport points out that darker-skinned K-pop stars are also often stereotyped as “sexy” in comparison to their “cute, doll-like” paler counterparts, citing the example of Hyolyn from Sistar, who is known as “the Korean Beyoncé”.One thing common to colourism in all these guises is a disproportionate impact on female artists and fans. The tradition of “lighties”, “yellowbones” or “light-skinned tings” being objects of desire and status symbols in the music videos of male artists runs across pop genres – a situation that can be as demeaning for the fetishised as it is for the ignored. In a December 2006 interview with Essence magazine, Kanye West is quoted as saying: “If it wasn’t for race mixing there’d be no video girls. Me and most of our friends like mutts a lot. Yeah, in the hood they call ’em mutts.”If you assumed attitudes must have matured since, you’d have been disappointed by a 2016 Yeezy fashion show casting call that requested “multiracial women only” and by that now-infamous post-VMAs photo from the same year. It featured some of the most powerful men in entertainment (Swizz Beatz, Jay-Z, Steve Stoute, Kanye West, Sean “Diddy” Combs) sitting down to a post-VMAs drink with their light-skinned or non-black significant others standing dutifully behind them (Alicia Keys, Beyoncé again, Lauren Branche, Kim Kardashian-West and Cassie). It’s as if they’d chosen to have their photo taken right at the intersection of colourism and sexism, like tourists posing under the Welcome to Las Vegas sign.Around 2011, this all became a bit much for UK grime artist Lioness. “I stopped creating music for about six years, and in that time I constantly saw, on social media, dark-skinned women being the topic of banter from – most commonly – dark-skinned men,” she says. “Part of the reason I left the industry was because of comments from A\u0026ampRs about my complexion … It wasn’t in their interests to go against the believed wisdom within the industry that the general public wouldn’t buy into a dark-skinned female.”When Lioness did make her comeback, it was with a renewed determination to tell the truth about this industry-wide issue. Her 2018 release DBT (Dead Black Ting) Remix brought together a melanin-magnificent lineup of female MCs: Queenie, Stush, Shystie, Lady Leshurr and Little Simz. Lioness’s new project, Overdraft, comes out in October and she says she has “absolutely” noticed an industry change in the meantime.“We have dark-skinned males now making songs that broach the topic. The dark-skinned male has always been accepted within the music industry, so when he now speaks on colourism, it’s monumental. When it comes from black women themselves, however, it’s unfortunately seen by the masses as another complaint. The Angry Black Female strikes again.”Lioness specifically points to two recent releases: the shining beacon of paternal pride that is Ghetts’s Black Rose and the sultry, summery desire of Che Lingo’s Black Girl Magic. Further afield, there’s also Black Hypocrisy by Jamaican dancehall artist Spice and Kendrick Lamar’s Complexion (A Zulu Love). Beyoncé’s great – we all stan Beyoncé – but if Beyoncé is the only shade that’s celebrated, then the whole world is missing out. “I’m glad I took time out at 22 years old, to thicken my skin and realise my worth,” says Lioness. “In 2019, I accept any challenge where my complexion is concerned!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

It is embarrassing, but it is not a threat to national security. It is the duty of media organisations to bring new and interesting facts into the public domain. That is what they are there for. It came after Hunt, the foreign secretary, who is battling head to head with Johnson to be the next Conservative prime minister, said he would “defend to the hilt” the right of the press to publish the leaks.Hunt wrote on Twitter: “These leaks damaged UKUS relations and cost a loyal ambassador his job, so the person responsible must be held fully to account. But I defend to the hilt the right of the press to publish those leaks if they receive them and judge them to be in the public interest: that is their job.”The politan police has launched a criminal investigation into the leak of the messages, which were sent to the Mail on Sunday. The UK’s largest police force threatened the media with prosecution for publishing the dispatches.George Osborne and other editors accused Scotland Yard of encroaching on press freedom. The inquiry by the Met counter-terrorism command, which is responsible for investigating breaches of the Official Secrets Act, was announced in a statement attributed to the assistant commissioner Neil Basu.Earlier, the former defence secretary Michael Fallon suggested journalists should be subject to the Official Secrets Act.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday, Fallon welcomed the Met investigation, describing the leak as a “clear breach of the Official Secrets Act” and “damaging to diplomatic efforts”.He added: “As soon as we find who did it, we should have them investigated and prosecuted.” Fallon said the advice to newspapers about not publishing the material was “quite logical”.Most of the offences covered by the legislation affect crown servants and government contractors. Any unlawful disclosure relating to security or intelligence by a member of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ is an offence. Officials do not need to sign the act to be bound by its provisions. The maximum punishment for leaking documents is two years in prison or an unlimited fine.An official is guilty of a crime if he or she \u0027without lawful authority makes a damaging disclosure\u0027 of information about international relations between states, defence, law enforcement, or which falls into a class of information likely to damage the security services’ work. Leaks are deemed to be damaging if, among other consequences, they \u0027endanger the interests of the United Kingdom abroad\u0027. There is a defence for any leaker that they released the material not knowing it would be damaging.\u0026nbspProsecutions under the Official Secrets Act are rare. Recent cases have included that of the MI5 agent David Shayler\u0026nbspin 2002. He was jailed for six months. In 2007, a Scotland Yard civilian employee,\u0026nbspThomas Lund-Lack, was sentenced to eight months for leaking information on planned al-Qaida operations in Britain to a Sunday Times journalist.A number of cases have involved civil servants who mislaid sensitive information. At least one,\u0026nbspRichard Jackson, a Cabinet Office official, was fined £2,500 under the act after he left classified papers relating to al-Qaida and Iraq on a train.\u0026nbspHe added: “If they are receiving stolen material then they should give it back to the rightful owner and should be aware of the huge damage done and potential greater damage by further breaches of the Official Secrets Act.”Fallon was then asked by the presenter, John Humphrys, whether journalists should comply with the act. He responded: “I don’t think anyone can entirely absolve themselves of the need to avoid damage to this country.“We have press freedom … but we also have laws. We have the Official Secrets Act and it is important that law is upheld.”When news of the Met police inquiry broke, Osborne, the former chancellor and now editor of the Evening Standard, appeared to suggest the statement, which called for any leaked documents to be returned to the government, was written by a junior officer and showed a lack of understanding of press freedom.The statement said: “The publication of leaked communications, knowing the damage they have caused or are likely to cause, may also be a criminal matter.“I would advise all owners, editors and publishers of social and mainstream media not to publish leaked government documents that may already be in their possession, or which may be offered to them, and to turn them over to the police or give them back to their rightful owner, Her Majesty’s government.”In the cables allegedly leaked to the Mail on Sunday, the UK’s outgoing ambassador to Washington, Sir Kim Darroch told his bosses in London that:Osborne described the statement as “ill-advised”, saying: “If I were the politan police commissioner, and I wanted to maintain my credibility and the credibility of my force, I would quickly distance myself from this very stupid and ill-advised statement from a junior officer who doesn’t appear to understand much about press freedom.”On Saturday he tweeted:Tim Shipman, the Sunday Times political editor, criticised the “sinister, absurd, anti-democratic statement this evening threatening journalists with arrest for printing government leaks”, and asked the Met on Twitter: “Do you have any comprehension of a free society? This isn’t Russia.” The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb said the remarks suggested a “slippery slope to a police state”.Speaking at the Tory hustings, Johnson said: “In my view there is no threat to national security implied the release of this material. It is embarrassing, but it is not a threat to national security. “It is the duty of media organisations to bring new and interesting facts into the public domain. That is what they are there for. “A prosecution on this basis would amount to an infringement on press freedom and have a chilling effect on public debate. That is my view.Darroch announced he was resigning on Wednesday, saying his position had become “impossible” following the leak of dispatches in which he described Donald Trump’s White House as “inept” and “dysfunctional”.The comments drew a furious response from the US president, who said the White House would no longer deal with Darroch.In the House of Commons on Thursday, the Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan said an internal Whitehall inquiry had found no evidence the leak was the result of computer hacking.Instead, he told MPs the focus was on finding “someone within the system who has released illicitly these communications”.The chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, questioned whether journalists who published such material were committing an offence. “I doubt it is a crime to publish. The ability to have a free press is essential,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/199858d27fb8a3815025a7d17dda40ff59624513/0_145_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c088026320bbcaba4c430594f0940206","title":"share your memories of the apollo 11 moon landings","story":"Do you remember where you were when man first landed on the moon?

Some women find symptoms so overwhelming that they even think about quitting their jobs.The writer, Rose George has shared her own experiences of the menopause in a  article where she also raised the question why so little is known about it: “I woke up fatigued, stinking and angry that something so common, something that affects millions of women, is still such a medical mystery. Why do we get hot flushes? We don’t know. Why is sleep broken? We don’t know. Why are we the only creatures to get menopause apart from two types of whales? We don’t know.”Not everyone experiences problems with the menopause and many say that it can be a liberating time for women.The menopause affects women in myriad ways and we’d like to find out about your experiences. How has it affected you and what steps, if any, have you taken to tackle symptoms? Do you feel that your concerns or problems have been taken seriously by a medical professional?

Geoff Boycott and Mike Brearley put on 129 for the first wicket but too slowly and Joel Garner’s 5-38 leads a rout.“At 22 and having played a year of international cricket I’d faced nothing as unique as a World Cup final because, let’s face it, they don’t come around that often as we’ve noticed. At that age it was a very special day. You’re not thinking: ‘This could be my only one,’ you’re thinking: ‘This is great,’ because with that youth comes a certain naivety and the truth is with West Indies everyone was aware it needed to be a very special performance if we were going to come out with the World Cup in our hands.“I learned to have great respect for the West Indies pace attack pretty early on and I still have it now more than 40 years later. I still think on their day they were as good as any attack in history. That Lord’s pitch was a good one – flat, low bounce, it wasn’t frightening – but when you get to the stage where you need to accelerate rapidly by the standards of the day and they stick Joel Garner on you’re thinking: ‘That’s not fair.’ So that was tough.“It was a 60-over game but by the standards of the day 280-odd was a lot and the game was played very differently. The wickets-in-hand mantra was a big one in those days. There were conflicting reports of what was said or not said during that chase but the simple truth is we got off to a steady but too slow start.“This year is England’s best chance ever, we’ve got a brilliant team. On this occasion, they’ve got better and better the last three games they’ve played. So let’s hope that trend continues, in which case we’ll be having a very, very lovely day at Lord’s.”Eden Gardens, Kolkata: Australia, 253-5, beat England, 246-8, by seven runs With England 135 for two in the 32nd over of their chase, Allan Border brings himself on to bowl his part-time slow-left-arm spin. The decision by Mike Gatting to reverse-sweep Border’s first ball turns the game.“It was probably the best atmosphere I’d played in, the noise the crowd made was absolutely phenomenal. But after we had beaten India in the semi-final most of them were supporting Australia. Myself and Bill Athey got us somewhere close in the chase and then I played a shot that people are still talking about to this day. I had played it a lot during my career and with the field Allan Border had set, there was only one place he was going to bowl the ball and that was somewhere around leg stump. So I just set my sights on playing that whatever his first ball was going to be, because I was in, playing well and was just going to try and continue being positive.“Had I left it, it would certainly have been a leg-side wide. But I was seeing the ball well, feeling good and it was a shot I was quite happy playing. Unfortunately, it just clipped my shoulder and just lobbed up to the wicketkeeper. Had it missed my shoulder it would have been three or four runs, we’d have still been going and we might have won it.Melbourne Cricket Ground: Pakistan, 249-6, beat England, 227, by 22 runs Javed Miandad survives two lbw appeals from Derek Pringle when England have Pakistan two wickets down early on but Graham Gooch’s side are unable to chase down a sizable total.“Back in the day there was no internet, so you were unaware of what was happening back home. We saw the odd English newspaper and the English journos were out there but you didn’t know if the whole country was behind you or anything like that because, one, you’re in Australia and, two, communication was nothing like it is now. For us it felt big – it was one of the biggest disappointments of my career not to have won that final.“It was the very early days of the Barmy Army, it was a good atmosphere at the MCG, maybe 80-odd thousand there but the majority were Australians because they thought they’d get there but they didn’t even reach the knockout stage, which was good.“It was a massive occasion but when you’re out there you block out the crowd to do your job. There’s a couple of abiding memories – the Pring lbws and then the two balls Wasim Akram delivered to bowl Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis.“This England side have got to be true to themselves and just keep playing how they have been playing. It’s difficult to take the final out of the equation and treat it as just another game because it’s bigger than that. But I’d say try and control those nerves and don’t look too far ahead. Go out there and express yourselves, always take the positive option, don’t go into your shells and really embrace what a World Cup final is all about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d24c88ec56cfc27dd0d438784f19fd362127531c/0_119_5087_3051/master/5087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7360d7f8463c1cdd95978eb066a383","title":"valtteri bottas lewis hamilton british f1 gp pole mercedes","story":"Valtteri Bottas took pole for the British Grand Prix, putting in a fine performance in qualifying under great pressure from the challenge of his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, who was in second place at Silverstone by just six-thousandths of a second. Charles Leclerc was in third for Ferrari but his teammate Sebastian Vettel could manage only sixth. Max Verstappen was in fourth for Red Bull with his teammate Pierre Gasly in fifth.Bottas had to pull put an exceptional lap to deny Hamilton and delivered with an almost perfect run on his first flying lap in Q3. On the first hot runs in the final third, Hamilton was quickest in the first and third sectors but had a moment of oversteer through Brooklands in the middle sector and Bottas was able to best his teammate by three tenths, with a time of 1min 25.093sec. Ferrari, however, had work to do, with Leclerc behind Verstappen in fourth and Vettel in sixth.On the second runs, Bottas did not improve and although Hamilton managed to string together three strong sectors he was still not happy with his final lap despite being denied by the finest of margins. “It just got away from us,” he said. Bottas rightly celebrated besting Hamilton at his home circuit in front of a fiercely partisan crowd, a major result for the Finn.Hamilton led the timesheets in Q1 with Leclerc quickest in Q2. Vettel and Leclerc set their best time in Q2 on the soft tyres, perhaps looking for extra grip off the line in contrast to Hamilton and Bottas, who will start on the medium rubber. Pirelli believe the tyre wear will be such that the teams will have to adopt a two-stop strategy.Bottas’s 10th career pole position is his first at the British Grand Prix, his fourth this season and a return to form of the strong start the Finn has made in the single lap discipline. He has out-qualified Hamilton now by four poles to three. He will badly want to ensure he converts it to a win, however. In both China and Spain, he was beaten off the line by Hamilton who went on to take victory and leads the world championship.Bottas clearly desperately wants to prevent Hamilton from romping away with it. The Finn took a dominant win in Australia and was similarly strong in Baku for his second victory now he needs to back them by taking the flag here to return the pressure on Hamilton in his challenge for the title.Mercedes have secured seven of the 10 poles this season and an exceptional seven front-row lockouts. They have six one-two finishes, too, and a seventh looks to be strongly on the cards.Hamilton has four wins from the last five races, which has ensured he has a dominant position in the world championship. The British driver leads Bottas by 31 points with Vettel 74 points back. Mercedes have won all but one race this season, Red Bull’s Max Verstappen taking the flag at the last round in Austria. Mercedes had expected their car to struggle somewhat in the high temperatures in Austria but the windy flatlands of Silverstone could not have been more accommodating on Saturday, with overcast skies and a chill in the air. The circuit’s fast corners play to their strengths and they had looked to be on good form from early in the weekend at a track where they have only been beaten once in the turbo-hybrid era. Bottas and Hamilton led the second practice session but Leclerc and Vettel were on top on Saturday morning.McLaren’s Lando Norris was once again very strong with eighth place. Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hülkenberg were in seventh and 10th for Renault with Toro Rosso’s Alexander Albon in ninth.Antonio Giovinazzi and Kimi Räikkönen were in 11th and 12th, with the second McLaren of Carlos Sainz in 13th. Roman Grosjean was in 14th for Haas and Sergio Pérez was in 15th for Racing Point.Kevin Magnussen finished in 16th for Haas, in front of the Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat. Lance Stroll once again went out in Q1, finishing in 18th for Racing Point. George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 19th and 20th for Williams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9a1a7c2869d836bbd4ea8ab7f131343be86381/586_615_3362_2017/master/3362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bedbab3b134e88ec1aa742fb005f594","title":"tour de france 2019 stage eight live cycling","story":"38km to go. Brian Smith on Eurosport thinks that the De Gendt and De Marchi’s chances of success are dwindling. Astana are pulling hard on the front of the peloton and the gap is down to 2min 30sec so he could well be right.45km to go. De Gendt and De Marchi still have 3min so sec on the peloton but King and Terpstra are back in the main bunch.Here are the polka dot point results from the Côte d’Aveize:1. De Gendt, 5pts2. De Marchi, 3pts3. King, 2pts4. Omar Fraile, 1pt50km to go. Lots of excitement on Eurosport as they focus on Sagan struggling to stay on the back of the peloton, baffling. With less than kilometre to the summit Sagan will easily be able to make up any gaps on the descent.As the kilometres tick down are the break’s chances of victory increasing?55km to go. The peloton, which is around 3min 55sec down on the two leaders, has seen Bahrain–Merida’s Dylan Teuns go off the back on the climb, according to race radio. The Belgian is currently third on GC. Astana climber Luis León Sánchez has also apparently fallen back.60km to go. With De Gendt and De Marchi at 45sec ahead of Terpstra and King, with the peloton at 3min 50sec, the Italian is lucky to escape a serious crash as he misses a turn on the descent. De Marchi gets back to De Gendt as they approach the penultimate categorised climb of the day.67km to go. We have a split in the breakaway, De Gendt and De Marchi have left their fellow leaders behind on the climb and opened up a 20 second gap to Terpstra and King. They are all over the Côte de la Croix de Part now though.The King of the Mountain points going thus: it has also been confirmed that Cofidis’ Christophe Laporte has abandoned.69km to go. A little issue for Alaphilippe at the start of the climb, the Frenchman was looking down at this chain and apparently has a mechanical issue. He could well need a bike change but there is enough time for him to get back, the only question will be what that takes out of him. Meanwhile the break has been working hard and gone back out to almost four minutes ahead.71km to go. We are climbing again, this could well be where the break is ultimately undone. The gap is back down to around three minutes. Bad news for the break?84km to go. Perhaps at the behest of De Gendt, the break has pulled out the time gap back to 3min 20sec with the race in a bit of a lull before the next climb sees the riders go up the Côte de la Croix de Part. De Gendt still doing his job for the team. Over the Côte d’Affoux he took a couple more King of the Mountain points, King took the other one on offer.101km to go. Up and over the Cote d’Affoux, the breakaway’s gap is now just three minutes. There has been some cracks beginning to emerge amongst the foursome up the road, De Gendt and De Marchi sharing some terse words with suggestions that the Belgian was unhappy with effort being put in by the CCC rider. The Lotto-Soudal man could well disappear off up the road if he feels the riders around him holding back his chances of victory.The thought is beginning to propagate that perhaps Alaphilippe isn’t completely without hope for the GC. Pyrenees will certainly be interesting on this front. Thomas will overhaul him, you’d imagine. But he may not be completely without hope of the podium. But in general, it’s funny how Alaphilippe is treated in this regard. He can really climb with the best of them.I would certainly agree with that, David. With Alaphilippe the question is not so much his climbing but how he maintains a challenge over the course of a three-week race. If he is looking good in the Pyrenees then it will be interesting to see what kind of resources Deceuninck–Quick-Step give him to compete. A hairy moment for Geraint Thomas. Looks like I missed this during lunch, but the Team Ineos co-leader appeared to suffer a mechanical. According to race radio Thomas is now back in the pack.Here are the polka dot points from there:1. De Gendt, 5pts2. King, 3pts3. De Marchi, 2pts4. Niki Terpstra, 1ptsCatching up, De Gendt also took the mountain points at the Col de la Croix de Thel, here are those results: At this point I am going to run out for a quick spot of lunch. But never fear, any major updates will still be covered.127km to go. The breakaway’s advantage continues to shrink as they head up Col de La Criox de Thel. It is now down to around four minutes, this could could well keep falling but the quality of the riders in that lead group suggests they will fight to stay away. De Gendt, who has history riding into Saint Etienne from his 2017 Dauphiné win there, in particular will be dangerous.Bora-Hansgrohe have taken up the front of the peloton and are pushing hard. After getting out to beyond five minutes the break is now starting to be reeled back in, it is now down to 4min 40sec. The break has passed the over the summit of Col de la Croix Montmain with De Gendt soaking up the King of the Mountain points to help his Lotto Soudal teammate Tim Wellens stay in the polka dot jersey. Here is how that mini-battle panned out: Thibaut Pinot and the rest of the Frenchmen in the peloton will certainly be keen to make their mark this weekend but I am not sure today is one for the GC contenders. Alaphilippe on the other hand...The break is making its way up the Col de la Croix Montmain, stage eight’s first and seemingly most straightforward climb. The time gap back to the peloton continues to hover around the five minute mark.The points classification now reads:And here is how that sprint shook out:Elia Viviani, Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews make up the demi-podium as the peloton goes through the sprint marker at Cercie. Bahrain-Merida’s Sonny Colbrelli came in fourth.Here is how that shakes out in terms of points:Terpstra takes the 20 points on offer in the points race in uncontested fashion. We should see more competition when the main group comes through in about five minutes.As the breakaway group nears a five-minute lead on the peloton, Jonathan Harris-Bass is talking about beaujolais wine on Eurosport. The leaders are about a kilometre out from the intermediate sprint, the day’s first point of action.De Marchi has now joined De Gendt, Terpstra and King at the front. The four-man break has around 3min 55sec on the peloton.How fast do you need to ride to get in the break? Well today it was around 47kmh:I think it is safe to say that with the gap growing to more than two minutes that this trio will be allowed to stay away, at least for the time being. De Marchi is still in pursuit, around 35 second back, and as the break continues to gain time De Gendt, Terpstra and King could let the Italian join, but it is not happening quickly though.CCC’s Alessandro De Marchi is now after the trio up the road after Würtz failed to bridge. Early stages but the time gap continues to grow.We have a trio of breakaway riders. Thomas de Gendt (Lotto Soudal), Niki Terpstra (Total Direct Énergie) and Ben King (Dimension Data) have gone off front, with Katusha’s Mads Würtz in pursuit. They have about 30 seconds on the peloton at the moment with CCC on the front weighing up whether to try and put the effort in to bring them back.In case you did not know, it is Bastille Day tomorrow: A quick update, Tejay van Garderen is out of the Tour. The EF Education First rider was not considered a GC contender but his absence will not help Rigoberto Urán in the Colombian’s bid for yellow. The American broke his hand in an early crash on Friday and has been forced to abandon.And we’re off... kind of.  The flag drops to signal the end of the neutral zone at around 7km, there is an early sprint so we could well have action from the gun.The countdown is on at the start line. The jerseys are all placed at the front, riders are twitchily checking their tyres and streets are packed. Time for the rollout.The Tour’s first saunter into La Massif Central features four category two climbs - difficult but not a real challenge for the general classification contenders - amongst plenty of lesser bumps. It will be hot and the roads are going to be rough, literally. The region is renowned amongst riders for the poor quality of the road surfacing, which might sound slightly a-ish but over the course of 200km it strains the legs. Add into that some narrow tracks and tricky ascents for what should offer a test for the entire peloton.Other theories are that this could be a day for a breakaway but how often in recent Tour de France history has that been allowed to happen? Perhaps a big break with no GC contenders? It is a stage that suits a man of Alejandro Valverde’s talents but will Movistar let one of their triumvirate freelance for a stage win? At 2:55 down he could be let go but his team could well decide that he is better served to save his legs as a super domestique.There are plenty of questions, but hopefully none of them will be “can you wake me up for the sprint?”Catching up?

As Brown recalled in a WNYC interview last month, Reiter said he had talked to many reporters and told them precisely where to find damning evidence against Epstein. But nothing ever came of it.“He was convinced that a lot of media had squashed the story and he was fed up,” she said.Reiter warned Brown what would happen were she to continue digging: “Somebody’s going to call your publisher and the next thing you know you are going to be assigned to the obituaries department.”Brown did not heed his warning. She flung herself at the investigation and eventually persuaded Reiter to go on record. Her resulting, award-winning three-part series last November exposed a vast operation in which 80 potential victims were identified, some as young as 13 and 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. She persuaded eight to tell their stories.Brown also exposed a government cover-up in which Epstein got away with an exceptionally light sentence that saw him serve only 13 months in jail. She discovered that a “non-prosecution agreement” had been negotiated secretly in 2008 by the then top federal prosecutor in Miami, Alexander Acosta, that gave Epstein and his co-conspirators immunity from federal prosecution.In 2017, Acosta was appointed by Donald Trump as labor secretary, a post that ironically is responsible for combating sex trafficking.The media’s handling – or mishandling – of the Epstein affair is a story of extremes. It is a heartwarming success story, of how one intrepid reporter pierced the veil of secrecy and found the truth. Brown’s coverage has had consequences: Epstein was arrested last Saturday and indicted on new sex trafficking charges by New York prosecutors who praised her work. In the fallout, Acosta was forced to resign.But there is also a less cheerful narrative. Why did the police chief’s appeals to the media fall on deaf ears? Why would so many years pass before the shocking extent of Epstein’s crimes and Acosta’s sweetheart deal were revealed by a local newspaper with severely limited resources?In fact, the two extremes of the story are directly linked: Brown told WNYC one of the reasons she began looking into Epstein was that she was puzzled about the public silence surrounding him.“There really was nobody pursuing this at all,” she said. “That was one of the things that intrigued me about this case. Why isn’t anyone standing up and screaming?”That silence stretches all the way back to 2003, when Vicky Ward wrote a profile of Epstein for Vanity Fair. During her reporting, she was introduced to a mother and her two daughters from Phoenix, Arizona who alleged Epstein assaulted the girls, one of whom was 16 at the time.Ward told the  she spent a lot of time with the family discussing whether they should go public.“They were frightened,” she said. “The mother told me that every night when she walked the dog she looked over her shoulder.”Eventually, the women agreed to go on the record, Ward said, and when Epstein was told about their accounts he went “berserk”. Epstein had already threatened to get a witch doctor to put a curse on Ward’s unborn children – she was pregnant with twins at the time – and now he campaigned to stop Vanity Fair publishing the allegations, even turning up unannounced at the office of the then editor, Graydon Carter.Publication was delayed, then Ward was told the paragraphs on the abuse of the women had been deleted.“I was extraordinarily upset,” she said. “I asked the women what they were going to do and they said they would lick their wounds and retreat, as this was exactly what they feared would happen.”Ward believes Carter caved under Epstein’s pressure. She recalls confronting the editor about the excised paragraphs, and said she has a note in her archives that has Carter saying: “I believe him … I’m Canadian.”Carter remembers events very differently. In his account there were legal issues around the women’s stories that prevented publication, most significantly that the women themselves were unwilling to go on the record.In a statement to the , Carter said: “I respected the work Vicky Ward did at Vanity Fair but unfortunately her recounting of the facts around the Epstein article is inaccurate. There were not three sources on the record and therefore this aspect of the story did not meet our legal and editorial standards.”Ward says she has documentary evidence that shows the women were emphatically prepared to go public, including fact-checkers’ and legal emails to Epstein from Vanity Fair asking for his response to the allegations made by both sisters. spoke to the mother of the girls, Janice Farmer. She said all three did speak to Ward in 2003 and told her on the record what Epstein had done, including allegations he had invited her youngest daughter, then 16, to his New Mexico ranch and molested her.“I was hesitant to go public because I was worried about the safety of my daughters – by that point I didn’t trust Jeffrey at all,” Farmer said. “But I did want him to be exposed.”She said she recalls vividly agreeing with Ward along with her daughters for their stories to be told in her Vanity Fair profile. She also said she recalls vividly her reaction when she learnt that part of the piece was not to be published.“I felt angry,” she said. “I felt like Jeffrey’s money, power, connections – whatever – had been put into play.”There is another complicating element to the story. In 2011, after Epstein had gone to jail, Ward wrote a blogpost for Vanity Fair. In it she used language that was strikingly uncritical of Epstein, referring to him as “not without humor” and praising him for being highly knowledgable.She referenced Epstein’s sex crimes as “sexual peccadilloes” and referred to her 2003 Vanity Fair profile of him, saying it had alluded to his sexual relationships with young women but “didn’t really go there, focusing instead on … how Jeffrey made his money”.The piece went on: “This is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite whom to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead.” put this blogpost to Ward and she said she regretted writing it. At that point, she said, the victims she had interviewed were not willing to talk. But nonetheless, “this blog did not need to be written – here I am toeing the Vanity Fair party line”.Fast forward to 2007, when Acosta reached his bizarrely lenient plea deal with Epstein. By then, investigators had identified 35 potential victims who said they had been lured into Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion and sexually assaulted.Yet records obtained by the Miami Herald showed prosecutors led by Acosta actively worked with Epstein’s attorneys to minimize media coverage.One of Acosta’s prosecutors wrote in an email to Jay Lefkowitz, an Epstein lawyer: “On an ‘avoid the press’ note … I can file the charge in district court in Miami which will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly. Do you want to check that out?”That Acosta felt that he had to resign on Friday was an indication that the collective failure of US media to grapple with a story of serial sex trafficking and abuse that had been hiding in plain sight for years no longer holds true. In the wake of Brown’s exemplary reporting, the rest of the American media has fallen in line. Acosta paid the price.Mary Angela Bock, associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s school of journalism, said #MeToo had dented the prevailing patriarchy that has existed in newsrooms for decades and that had led to sexual crimes being overlooked as merely “the way of the world”.“#MeToo has led to greater awareness among journalists that this is not OK,” she said. “This is not ‘boys being boys’. This is rape and sexual exploitation of children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f7986b918746f652fd2efc1a7fa6b8809031a8/0_0_2632_1579/master/2632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c180ae77bbe12c5f014b2bd7864222","title":"louisiana in state of emergency bracing for tropical storm barry","story":"New Orleans residents told to seek shelter as 50,000 coastal residents left without powerTropical Storm Barry was strengthening as it approached the Louisiana coast on Saturday.The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its 8am advisory the storm’s maximum sustained winds had increased 5mph to 70mph, with higher gusts. Barry was expected to reach hurricane strength by the time its center reached the Louisiana coast, expected before noon local time. The storm is expected to weaken after it moves inland.

Some airlines, including British Airways, cancelled outbound flights from the city on Saturday.Mandatory evacuations were imposed in flood-prone coastal areas of two neighbouring parishes south of the city.A performance scheduled for Sunday by the Rolling Stones at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which served as an emergency shelter during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, was postponed until Monday.The impending storm was widely seen as a key test of the fortified flood defences put in place following Katrina, which inundated much of the city and killed about 1,800 people.Barry is expected to cross the coastline south-west of New Orleans on Saturday morning. It is forecast to reach category one hurricane strength by then, with winds of at least 74mph, the National Weather Service said.The storm’s flood potential, rather than its high winds, posed the greatest danger to low-lying New Orleans, a city virtually surrounded on all sides by rising waters.Benjamin Schott, a meteorologist, said: “Tropical Storm Barry is a dangerous and life-threatening storm.”Authorities were keeping a particularly watchful eye on the levee system built to contain the lower Mississippi River, which winds through the heart of New Orleans and was already well above flood stage from months of heavy upstream rainfall over the midwest.A coastal storm surge into the mouth of the Mississippi is expected to push its crest to 5.8 metres in New Orleans, the highest level since 1950 and dangerously close to the top of the city’s levees.The brunt of Barry was expected to skirt the western edge of New Orleans, avoiding a direct hit. But LaToya Cantrell, the city’s mayor, said 48 hours of heavy downpours could overwhelm pumps designed to purge streets and storm drains of excess water.“There is no system in the world that can handle that amount of rainfall in such a short period,” Cantrell said on Twitter.New Orleans was already saturated after thunderstorms drenched the city with a foot of rain on Wednesday.Robert Harris, sitting on a sidewalk and polishing his trombone, said: “If it’s worse than the other day, it’d be the worst week since Katrina.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb3d69189f05075bcc23b671aeafbc98dbc76e9/0_619_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51be030400a024fc571487e2dba33028","title":"experience i tunnelled under the berlin wall","story":"My real fear was the border guards and Stasi, who were listening for movement beneath the ground and digging their own tunnels to intercept oursIn 1961, I was 21 and studying civil engineering in East Germany. I was desperate to escape to the west the Berlin Wall, which started going up in August 1961, was becoming more impregnable every week. By winter, scores of people had been killed there or while trying to swim across the River Spree. It felt as if we were penned in, with no future at all.I was lucky. I managed to cross into West Berlin using a smuggled Swiss passport. I had to leave my girlfriend, Christa, and family behind, thinking I would never see them again. I’d told my parents of my plan, but not Christa: I thought our relationship would be over. When I arrived in West Berlin, I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing. I got some state support as a refugee, and enrolled at another university, but I missed Christa and my family.By now, border procedures had tightened up, and some school friends and I decided we would tunnel under the wall to help others get out. A friend put us in touch with other tunnel-digging students in need of manpower. We were part of a few successful projects I had the skills to survey the tunnels, but other diggers were medical or philosophy students.We would make a deep pit in the soil and, as a team, dig 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in 12-hour shifts over several months. Lying on our backs, we pushed the spade in 10cm each time, and used a wagon attached to a rope to remove the dirt. The tunnels were 140 metres long, 80cm high and 80cm wide – small enough to dig quickly but big enough to turn around in. While it was claustrophobic, my real fear was the border guards and Stasi, who were listening for movement beneath the ground and digging their own tunnels to intercept ours.Some diggers were shot by the Stasi as they emerged in the east one tunnel was compromised when a girl who hoped to escape was overheard by an informant. About 20 people were sent to prison for planning to escape through it. Christa was among them. I felt guilty, and angry, but there was nothing I could do. Over the next few years, the diggers became anonymous heroes we couldn’t tell anybody what we were doing, not even family. The most successful tunnel – later named Tunnel 57, for the number of people who escaped through it – was dug in 1964. It began in the cellar of a disused bakery and ended, by accident, in a disused outhouse in the garden of an East Berlin apartment building.The day of the tunnel opening, I came home to find a letter from Christa telling me she had been released early, after 16 months in prison. I sent a courier to tell her about the tunnel, with a small teddy bear she’d sent me years earlier, so she’d know it was me.That night, my job was to crawl through to East Berlin and stand in the outhouse to watch for escapees coming across the yard. They were families, couples – people we knew. The mood was quietly euphoric. Soon, a digger arrived with a woman in his arms. “Be careful with this girl,” he whispered, “she is so nervous.” It was Christa. We embraced, but I couldn’t go with her: I had to finish the job.On the first night, 28 people escaped. By midnight on the second night, 29 others had come through. Then two unknown men appeared they said they needed to collect their friend, waiting around the corner. They reappeared with a border guard. Shots were fired between a digger named Christian and the guard as we raced back through the tunnel.In the morning, East Berlin radio claimed agents from the west had killed a border officer. We were shocked. It was a propaganda coup for the GDR and the young guard, Egon Schultz, became a martyr. Christian went to his grave thinking he had killed a man he never forgave himself. In the 90s, the truth emerged: Schultz had been killed by friendly fire from another guard.Christa and I married and had a family we lived in Frankfurt for 35 years, but I was blacklisted and couldn’t go with her and the children to visit their grandparents in the GDR. In 1971, I got a job with an international consulting company, responsible for transportation projects including the Channel tunnel. It’s my proudest achievement, but even that wasn’t without political difficulties: then, as now, some Brits wanted to remain an island.Through my job, I got to see a world I could have only dreamed of while in the GDR. And thanks to the Berlin tunnels, many others did, too.• As told to Nick ThompsonDo you have an experience to share?

Now, he wants to make sure that other tech workers can fight for what’s right without having to put their livelihood on the line.Poulson has started Tech Inquiry, a non-profit that aims to make it easier for coders with a conscience to speak out inside their companies when they feel ethical boundaries are being crossed. Just as importantly, he’s pushing for greater transparency to prevent workers simply being tricked into doing work that they would never take on voluntarily.“I believe tech workers need informed consent about when their work may lead to loss of life or suppression of human rights or freedoms,” Poulson told the  in London, where he is due to speak at the Open Rights Group’s annual conference on data and democracy on Saturday. “How is it that we help tech workers who saw something go wrong? How is it that we ensure they have a trusted avenue, somewhere to reach out, that isn’t necessarily going straight to a journalist?”The goal of Tech Inquiry is to harness the growing wave of employee discontent that has spread across Silicon Valley, and provide workers with the tools they need to stand up to their bosses and the information they need to know when that pushback is necessary. Poulson’s own stand against Project Dragonfly, Google’s effort to build a censored search engine to re-enter the Chinese market, is just one example of that movement. He also cites pushback within Google against Project Maven, a Pentagon AI project that that the company signed up to in April 2017, as well as movements at other companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Intel.Key to Poulson is extending that power to workers in the design and development phases of the industry, where work is often carried out in the greatest secrecy and the public has the least ability to kick up a fuss if it moves in a dangerous or alarming direction. “Internally, and especially in a research department like I was in, there is a feeling that you have a free pass until you’re actually getting ready to hit the button to launch it.”Adults tend not to search conversationally, Poulson explains, instead typing in more structured queries: rather than searching “how do I tie a bow tie”, they may just search “bow tie how to”. Because of that, YouTube had to find a better dataset to focus on more natural queries, and settled on child users.“One of the project leads is explaining that we’re going to use a data set from YouTube, and from a younger audience, because they use more natural language. I spoke out, and said ‘we can’t use children’s data’, and the response was ‘this is fine, their parents gave the OK’. I spoke to coworkers and they said ‘don’t worry, by the time the thing launches, we’ll have had a thorough privacy review’. When you do R\u0026ampD, there’s this idea that you can cut corners and have the privacy team fix it later.”Allowing free ethical rein for “experiments” is dangerous, Poulson argues. For one thing, by the time a project is nearing completion, “you’ve created an entire team whose entire career investment is to launch this thing. And, further, you’ve normalised the behaviour to a bunch of engineers. There’s something fundamental: The first time you see your company doing something, that’s when you’re going to speak out. After that, a switch flips for you, and you accept it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101ce028f43cfe167bed435e0192f82c0f32a535/0_65_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cab1b82ae2220840ab482f735f90cc6a","title":"the us world cup team is loudly proudly claiming the applause women deserve","story":"Celebrating yourself in a world which tells you you’re worth less than men is an act of resistance – and it’s angering insecure menSign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter​ on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.Help! I think I have lost my girlfriend to the US women’s soccer team. She can’t get enough of the World Cup champions and has spent the past week glued to their Instagram feeds. If she could run off and marry Ashlyn Harris I think she would.My partner isn’t the only one crushing on the soccer stars the USWNT are currently the darlings of America. And for very good reason: the women aren’t just sports stars, they’re rock stars. They’re fighting for equal pay they’re using their platforms to speak up about inequality and stand up to Donald Trump they’re raising the profile of women’s sports. And they’re doing it all while being loudly, proudly and unapologetically themselves.While I’ll admit that I’m still a little miffed that the US beat England, watching the USWNT team celebrate this week has been magical. It’s been a dose of unadulterated joy at a time when things are looking increasingly grim. And it’s been a reminder of all that is best about the United States. “We have pink hair and purple hair,” Megan Rapinoe said at Wednesday’s parade in New York. “We have tattoos and dreadlocks. We’ve got white girls and black girls and everything in between. Straight girls and gay girls.” The USWNT is a true reflection of a erse America, and that’s why they’re champions.There’s been a lot of talk about the power of female rage recently. Watching the US team celebrate, however, has been a reminder of the power of female joy. Women are supposed to keep ourselves small Megan Rapinoe’s power-pose unapologetically takes up space. It’s not just an acknowledgment of victory, it’s an expression of defiance. It says: I deserve to be here, I deserve admiration, I deserve applause.Women are supposed to be quiet about their achievements. The USWNT have been raucously celebrating all week. Celebrating yourself in a world which tells you you’re worth less than men, that you don’t deserve the same acknowledgment as men, is an act of resistance.There’s nothing some people hate more than seeing women enjoy themselves particularly if there aren’t any men involved. That’s one of the reasons conservatives had a meltdown about that video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing earlier this year. And it’s why insecure conservative men are currently frothing at the mouth about the USWNT. Ben Shapiro, for example, thinks Rapinoe is only getting $1m contracts because she is a “a very outspoken lesbian”. The Daily Wire, a rightwing media outlet, opined that they are “very hard to like” – which is code for “very hard to control”. Trump, meanwhile, seems to have finally run out of insults for Rapinoe and the team. Perhaps he’s finally realized they’ve got more balls than he’ll ever have.In other sports news, a Lithuanian couple have won the World Wife-Carrying Championship. First place prize is the wife’s weight in beer.I have actually lost track of how many times this man has been arrested. Maybe they should stop letting him out?

While this is great news, I wouldn’t get too excited. The kingdom made a big song and dance about letting women drive last year – at the same time, of course, it was locking up activists who had been campaigning for that right. Many of those female activists are still in jail. As a legal officer at the Gulf-focused legal advocacy NGO MENA Rights Group told the , this new report “must not be used as an excuse to ease international pressure on Saudi Arabia”.The conservative group One Million Moms is calling for a boycott of Toy Story 4. Why? Well because there is a scene in which two women are seen dropping a kid off at school. “The scene is subtle in order … to desensitize children,” One Million Moms wrote on its website.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.TfL urged to clean up dirty bus routes to save children from \u0026#39toxic school run\u0026#39Social pecking orders, strict dress codes, and strawberry food fights with Fergie - secrets of the Wimbledon Royal BoxBritain needs clearer policy on Iran as tensions heat up, says former Tehran diplomatBoko Haram leave trail of opioid addiction in northern Nigeria Two Duchesses watch the Queen of tennis: Kate and Meghan cheer on Serena at WimbledonHong Kong protesters clash with police on border with mainland China Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt defend press freedom as row over Sir Kim Darroch leaks escalates with Met warning to moleComment: No, Boris and Brexit have nothing in common with that ignoramus Donald TrumpBoris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt speak at Wyboston hustings\u0026#39Answer the bloody question!\u0026#39 Boris Johnson heckled at hustings in CheltenhamBriton among 26 dead in Somali hotel suicide blastSchools should be kept open all summer, running sports clubs, in a bid to tackle Britain\u0026#39s growing obesity crisisMissed Poldark?

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumLarry the cat sits in the street, at Downing Street in LondonBut it goes further and questions the very practice of passing platform\u0026nbspfees onto investors.“If a platform offers superior service to advisers, increasing operational efficiencies, is it fair that customers should pay for these very indirect benefits?” AFH asks in the report.In another quirk of the current system, adviser platforms are chosen by advisers but are paid for by consumers, as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pointed out in a report published in March.AFH suggests that financial advisory firms should absorb the cost of platform fees and do so without increasing other charges to make up for the expense.“Unlike ongoing adviser charges and active fund management, which seek to add direct value for clients, platform costs are a dead weight and only subtract from performance,” the firm says.The FCA stopped short of making the same recommendation in its report on investment platforms.AFH also found broader uncertainty about fees among a quarter of investors: 8 per cent of those surveyed were confused about what they pay for, an equal share didn’t understand the fees they pay, and another 8 per cent weren’t even aware they pay any fees.The share of perplexed investors was matched almost exactly by the 26 per cent of advisers who said they had always felt uncomfortable talking about fees and charges.\u0026nbsp“Perhaps they feel they can’t justify their expense or there are simply too many charges to explain,” AFH says.\u0026nbspThe research is based on two online surveys carried out in November, involving 221 financial advisers in the UK and 1,026 British adults with over £100,000 in personal savings who have seen a financial adviser.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now?

And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” He added: “They’ve not tried to turn it into a great big sort of circus or something, they’ve rolled it on and there you are ten years down the line. Everything you want is going to be there. Everything.”You can find a recap of what was occurin’\u0026nbspthe last time you saw the characters here.Gavin \u0026amp Stacey returns on Christmas Day 2019.\u0026nbspGavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on.

I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality.

Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

First of all, the pound is likely to drop significantly against other major currencies, as happened in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum.‘Many thousands’ of jobs lost in no-deal Brexit, minister warnsThis will rapidly increase the cost of imported raw materials and components at the same time as businesses have to deal with disruptions to their supply chain as the free movement of goods and services ends abruptly.Additional tariffs will further add to the cost of doing business as will non-tariff barriers such as customs checks, additional paperwork and quotas.Some businesses, such as those which rely heavily on sourcing parts from across the continent, will become unprofitable and inevitably have to lay off staff or even shut down completely.We have a number of forecasts of what this might mean for employment.In December, academics at the University of Sussex predicted that a no-deal scenario will cost 750,000 UK jobs, including 150,000 in London and over 80,000 in the northwest of England.Analysis by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by the mayor of London forecasts 87,000 jobs lost in the capital by 2030 out of a nationwide total of half a million.Across the EU, around 1.2 million jobs would be lost, according to a recent paper from the University of Leuven. It concluded that Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands would be the worst affected by a no-deal Brexit, with Dublin losing 50,330 jobs or 2.6 per cent of its entire workforce.This week the Northern Irish government sounded the alarm with a warning that the country would lose 40,000 jobs after a no-deal Brexit, primarily as a result of disruptions to trade with the Republic.While there is considerable variation in the predictions, all certainly support the business secretary’s assertion.The Bank of England’s Gertjan Vlieghe pointed to a further problem on Friday: that British workers,\u0026nbsphighly indebted and with low levels of savings, are ill-equipped to deal with the sudden slump in the labour market that Brexit may bring.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I started running in 1948 when I was a boy and since that time I have never left.”For the 20th time, and since its inception, Ruengo has crossed the finish line holding his national flag at the Safaricom Marathon in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (LWC), a Unesco world heritage site.\u0026nbspThe marathon is one of the toughest races in the world, and the only one to take place through a wildlife reserve. With an altitude of more than 5,500ft above sea level, a large part of the course is uphill, rolling across savannah plains and acacia woodland. There’s no respite from northern Kenya’s harsh sun, and participants battle the dust whipped up from the dirt road.\u0026nbsp“It’s got all the worst combinations,” says David Thuo, an aircraft engineer from Nairobi who completed the half marathon. “The altitude is very high, it goes uphill ... but I did get to see giraffes.”Runners say it’s the wildlife and landscape that draws them to these remote plains in\u0026nbspLewa. 16-year-old runner\u0026nbspWinfred, who came top 10 in the children’s\u0026nbsp5km\u0026nbsprace, says she “enjoyed seeing the wildlife. It’s a special race.”Created with Sketch.On a walking safari in Kenya\u0027s Maasai Mara Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sunrise over the conservancyCheetahs at Naboisho CampSundowners at Naboisho CampA starry night at Naboisho CampSunrise over the conservancyCheetahs at Naboisho CampSundowners at Naboisho CampA starry night at Naboisho CampA 61,000-acre area of protected land, the conservancy is home to critically endangered black rhino and Grevy’s zebra, as well as elephant and the big cats. The wildlife isn’t blocked from the course – runners often pass herds of zebra or giraffe lingering in the distance.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been trying to train the lions to become vegetarian but we haven’t succeeded,” Tusk CEO Charlie Mayhew said in the briefing the night before the race, drawing a nervous laugh from the crowd.\u0026nbspLed by conservation charity Tusk and LWC, the idea to organise a marathon though the reserve came from a conversation between Mayhew and the then-CEO of Lewa conservancy in the late 90s.500ft above sea level, a large part of the course is uphill, rolling across savannah plains (Naomi LarssonThe Independent)Tourists staying at the lodge would often ask if they could go for a jog. “And the answer is of course you can’t – but then it sparked an idea,” says Mayhew. “What about organising a running event here and using it as a way to raise money for conservation and the LWC.”Over the years Tusk has raised $5m for conservation efforts here in Lewa and across Kenya. The conservancy and the neighbouring communities who live here are supported by funds raised by the marathon – a medical clinic has opened, while a water irrigation project in nearby farmland has reached more than 4,000 people. \u0026nbsp“When great minds come together good things happen,” says Henry Wanyoike, 45-year-old Kenyan Paralympic champion. “I’m happy to be a part of it because the community benefits, and the environment, the animals. It’s very important for everyone.” \u0026nbspWe only interfere if the less friendly species are getting close to the trackFor organisers the impact is far-reaching, “planting a seed” for future conservationists.\u0026nbspFrom just 180 runners two decades ago, the race has grown to 1,400 participants from more than 27 countries. Runners from across Kenya take part, including wildlife rangers carrying full kit who represent the neighbouring conservancies, and warriors from local communities.\u0026nbspOrganisers say they’ve reached the limit – any more infrastructure to cater for participants and spectators would have too much of an impact on the reserve and its wildlife.\u0026nbspOn the race weekend you find rows of tents, stalls and music stages for post-race celebrations making it feel like its own version of Glastonbury (it takes place over the same weekend in June as the festival). There’s airport-style security, medical staff, caterers. “It’s a logistical nightmare,” says Mayhew.Indeed, the very nature of organising a marathon through a wildlife reserve brings its own set of challenges over the safety of humans, animals and landscape.\u0026nbspIndependent researchers conduct an environmental impact assessment of the marathon on the reserve every two to three years. But Mayhew claims the impact is “remarkably low”.\u0026nbsp“There’s a huge amount of conservancy left untouched. Any wildlife that is being spooked by race has a huge amount of space,” he says. “We only interfere if the less friendly species are getting close to the track.”It’s not an easy course. To me, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere in the worldHelicopter and a light aircraft fly overhead looking out for wildlife, while spotters are on hills overlooking the course.\u0026nbspIf any of the more dangerous species like buffalo, rhino or lion decide to get a bit too close to the track the airplane or helicopter will guide them away, using the sounds and the wind generated from the aircraft.\u0026nbspLast year a black rhino was spotted close to the course. Undeterred by the helicopter, organisers were forced to briefly stop the race until the rhino was a safe distance away.\u0026nbsp“This is what makes it so unique,” Mayhew says. “The whole idea of running in a game reserve really captures people’s imagination.”\u0026nbspOn race day the early morning haze soon turned to harsh heat.\u0026nbspRuengo celebrates at the finish line with his children (Naomi LarssonThe Independent)“It’s not an easy course. To me, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere in the world,” says Wanyoike. “But it’s one of the best races. We’re running on our own soil which means a lot.”Wanyoike is visually impaired, and is guided with his running partner Paul holding a cord. “It’s like an umbilical cord. He has to guide me through this, tell me when we are going up hill … he’s my eyes.”This was Wanyoike\u0027s 17th marathon at Lewa, where he achieved a personal best for the half at just over 1:25. The full marathon was won by Duncan Maivo at 2:20, and Emmah Kilole at 2:50 in the women’s race.\u0026nbspFor Kevin Bliss, a regular marathon runner based in the US, it was “by far the toughest race given the terrain and the undulation. But when it got tough, I looked around at the landscape, heard the bird noises. It was awesome.”The oldest runner, Ruengo, celebrated at the finish line with his children. “I like running because I can’t grow old so quickly. It means a lot to be here.”Will he do it again? “If God wishes, I will be here next year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride. Instead of embracing its industrial communities, Labour has retreated into its metropolitan enclaves.And this twist has thrown up a bizarre reversal of roles — Corbyn, the eternal rebel, is now the pathetic stooge of the pro-EU establishment, while Boris Johnson, the likely Tory victor, is the real warrior for British justice and liberty. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why all the cloak-and-dagger secrecy surrounding the godparents to Meghan and Harry’s son Prince Archie He’s seventh in line to the throne and, quite frankly,the majority of us had been standing next to the font, we’d probably struggle to name rumoured godparent Charlie van Straubenzee the following day.I have just typed it and I’ve forgotten it already. So why risk losing the already fragile goodwill of the public by treating them asthey’re tiresome selfie-hunters  It’s like those celebrities who put a “no photos” hand up when you haven’t even got your camera out.Or the ones who tell journalists the most anodyne fact about themselves, then add: “But don’t quote me on that.” As .It reminds me of the time when I found myself as a “plus one” at the wedding of a Z-list celebrity who had flogged his nuptials to Hello! magazine.Post-ceremony, the guests were left hanging around as the happy couple did their contracted, painfully proooootracted photoshoot, so I sauntered off to the shade of the nearest tree to make a phone call. Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub. The impeccably dutul Queen is hugely respected but, after she dies, what then The public may well feel that Harry, Meghan et al can have all the privacy they desire. But in , they must give up all the royal trappings and pay their own bills.TELLY regulator Ofcom has received  complaints from people concerned about the “mental health” of Love Island contestant Amy Hart after she was dumped by “half-boyfriend”Curtis Pritchard.Sigh. With everything going on in the world that’s truly worthy of complaint, how depressing that the type of “boy dumps girl”scenario that’s played out daily in homes, bars, schools, parks and cafes the world over is deemed to be a matter worthy of investigation.Yes, Amy was “heartbroken” and had a good sob. But anxiety is a “mental health” issue. So is depression, bi polar disorder, schizophrenia, etc etc.Feeling upset because someone you met three weeks ago has placed you back in the “friend zone” is not the same thing.Equally, Amy – who has now voluntarily left the villa – willingly signed up for a reality show where she knew full well that relationships are constantly tested and the ensuing responses filmed  .A bit of heartbreak is all part of le’s rich pattern, isn’t it  You feel awful for a few hours, days or weeks , then tell yourself that he she “isn’t worth it”, change out of your pyjamas and move on.Worryingly, Amy said Curtis had robbed her of her future. No Amy – you are your future, and anyone who comes along to share it with you is merely a bonus.Work on loving yourself and before long it will be: “Curtis, who ”THE number of pensioners wanting to flat-share has soared , per cent in the past decade.If The Bloke ever trips and falls under a busI will hopefully be one of them.My friends and I often muse that, one day, we’ll sell our current homes and pool resources to buy a large property that we’d name “Symbiosis House”.There, we would watch Escape To The Chateau, play Scrabble and backgammon, drink buckets of rose and look after each other by bringing our own set of skills to the late le party – be it cookery, gardening, administration or entertainment.We would have company when we needed it, but our own room to retreat to when we didn’t.And best of all, none of us would ever feel lonely.MICHAEL GOVE and David Cameron have reportedly ended their three- year feud with drinks at an exclusive private members’ club in London.Whether their once-friendly wives feel the same way remains to be seen.AS a patron of Help For Heroes, I can’t stress highly enough how important it is to support our Forces veterans.When we needed them, they put their lives on the line for us.And now they are the ones in need of help, this country must look after them. Who could argue against that Yet despite the ongoing physical and hidden injuriesall too many of them suffer, successive governments have failed to come up with a cohesive plan that actually delivers the right care for their needs.So The Sun’s campaign for a small, dedicated “Office Of Veterans’ Affairs” in the Cabinet Office is a vitally important one that could make a vast dference to the lives of, among so many others, soldiers such as Ben Parkinson, , who suffered le-changinginjuries in Afghanistan and now needs constant care. The next PM should put it at the top of his to-do list.JEREMY PAXMAN says he doesn’t miss presenting Newsnight because: “I spent  years listening to people talk b*****ks every night. That was enough.”At least he was paid to hear politicians etc wittering on. The rest of us have to pay for the, er, privilege in the form of the £. licence fee.“GOING in to town” was a big thing when I was in my late teens.We frequented the local pubs, spent hours in Cha Girl looking for the perfect jeans and gathered in cafes for gossipy chats over an exciting new drink called “cappuccino”.Now, according to high streets minister Jake Berry, middle-aged Brits like me are abandoning local shops because we’re either too busy working or engrossed in TV box sets.So he’s issued a plea for us to, “show the high street some love”.Hmmm.

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government. Or one of his and Corbyn’s proteges.It could well be the end of the party as a viable political force full-stop.Ah well. Time to say goodbye to Jezza. It was fun while it lasted, mate.

And some people may be prepared to tell you it’s eleven o’clock, or perhaps five to five. But I’m not going to do that. No. Not me. That’s for others to say.“I will tell you, beyond all doubt, that it is definitely not seven o’clock, and that’s the important thing, the thing voters care about. And that’s why I think I should be your Prime Minister. Because I will never tell the electorate it is seven o’clock when it isn’t. And, indeed, even when it is.“Does that answer your question, Julie ”GOOD – he’s gone. Sir Kim Darroch, our ambassador to the US.Caught out when leaked messages revealed he thinks Donald Trump is “inept” and the White House dysal.He had to go, evenhe has become a darling of the liberal establishment here for hating Trump.Here’s a suggestion. How about we get as his replacement someone who understands Trump and Trump’s appeal to US voters DO you really think Boris Johnson is going to get us out of the European Union  Properly, I mean, much as we voted for If so, pass the hallucinogens. I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hopefully now with them being back home they can start to process things a little better.When they were stuck in Puerto Rico it was very dficult for them to process what happened.Chloes older brother is  and hes doing very poorly. One of the first things the family are going to do when they get back is take him to the doctor to seethey can help and get him talking a little bit more.Chloes grandfather - known as Sam - was playing with Chloe when she asked him to lt her up on to a railing so she could bang on the glass, like she does at her older brothers ice hockey games.Tragically he thought there was glass there because it was in a wall of fixed windows - but it was open and she fell on to the concrete below.When askedthe family blame Chloes grandfather for the death, Winkleman said: I dont even knowtheyre necessarily at the point where they are even thinking about blame.I know theyve heard all the reports about him being very careless and holding Chloe out of the window - which he has steadfastly disputed.The focus for them is just getting home and laying Chloe to rest.He added: I think this was a perfect storm of bad things that happened concurrently so generally are these kind of windows dangerous to passengers No not necessarily, but there are laws and codes in the United States that are specically designed to prevent children falling out of windows.Its our early belief that these windows were not compliant with those regulations.Winkleman said the next stage of the investigation was to get hold of the CCTV footage - which he believes will prove the grandfathers version of events - and pin blame on Royal Caribbean for allowing the window to be open without any warning signs or notices.However he claims he has made repeated requests for the footage to Royal Caribbean which has refused to hand it over.Police in Puerto Rico have a copy of a video from the interior of the ship showing the fatal fall - and offered to show it to Chloes parents but the couple were too distraught to view the distressing footage.Instead they asked for a copy - but cops refused.One of the hold ups in our investigation is that Royal Caribbean have not provided us with CCTV footage of the incident which is the most critical piece of evidence, Winkleman explained.At this point theyve outright refused to produce the video.We definitively know there is footage of the incident from the interior of the ship because the police in Puerto Rico wanted to show it to the family but not surprisingly the mom and dad were not willing or ready to watch it at that point.They asked for a copy of it but the police would not give it to them.So for us now the next stage of the investigation is to get hold of the video.Weve repeatedly requested it through Royal Caribbean.If they are not willing to turn it over - it will speed up the timetable of us filing a lawsuit.There is no question that at some point we will get that video because we are absolutely entitled to it.The grandfather and several other family members were so hysterical after the child’s tragic death plunge that they had to be sedated by medics, according to El Vocero.Witnesses told how they heard the family wailing in agony after Chloe fell to her death.Royal Caribbean told the Sun Online they were unable to comment while the matter is under investigation.They said: We are assisting local authorities in San Juan, PR, as they make inquiries after an incident aboard Freedom of the Seas on Sunday.We do not have further information to share at this point."},{"url":null,"title":"family evicted council house takeaway rent kent","story":"Heavily pregnant Lucrezia Worrell, , her partner Daniel Eyers, , and his four young children have been ordered to leave their home in Gillingham, Kent.Daniel, who loves Indian and Chinese meals, said Medway Council officers told his family made themselves intentionally homeless by failing to pay rent.Instead, the couple spent their money on takeaways from JustEat, including a £ meal for his sons birthday.Daniel, who is the father to four children under the age of five, is now homeless with a newborn on the way.The dad of four, who says he cannot get a job because he has to drive his kids to school, admitted he sometimes makes a late rent payment but always pays the money thats owed.He told Kent Online: “We like to treat the children once a week to a takeaway.They don’t usually get much, so it’s a nice treat.“It was my son’s birthday the other month and we spent £ but were told by the council we were spending money on non-essentials rather than paying rent.”Daniel and Lucrezia, who are expecting a baby in less than a month, claim they can spend between £ and £ a week on takeaways.The couple, along with four kids, were living in a three-bedroom £, home in Chatham, Kent  until April when their landlord decided to end the tenancy.Since then, the family were living in emergency accommodation in Gillingham until bailfs turned up at their house on Monday to evict them.The familys takeaway habit was uncovered when Mr Eyres was asked to send over their bank statements.Despite falling behind on rent, the statements showed the family treated themselves to JustEat takeaways weekly.Daniel said: “I’ve been a Medway resident my whole le. It was hard enough being moved from Chatham to Gillingham as my children go to school in Chatham.“I couldn’t get a job as it meant my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”The couple, along with the five-year-old, four-year-old, and pair of two-year-old twins, are now staying with family until they plan out their next move.Since being turfed out of their home in Kent, the family were told there was a possibility of moving to a home  miles away in Tyne and Wear.Mark Breathwick, head of strategic housing at Medway Council, said support was provided to Mr Eyers before he was evicted and the council has continued to help him since.He added: “Emergency accommodation is provided to people where appropriate.”Eviction means your landlord ends your tenancy and you have to leave your property.You will get a written notice from the council with plans to evict you, at least  weeks in advance.For most types of tenancy, your council must tell you why theyre planning to evict you.If youre facing eviction over unpaid rent, your council must discuss your options and offer help.Your landlord can ask to see your bank statements, with your consent, and use as evidence to remove you from a property.The council need permission from a court to evict you.The court hearing will then decide whether eviction is justied or not.If you still dont leave the property after being evicted by a court, the council send bailfs to remove you and your belongings."},{"url":null,"title":"boy circumcised indonesia clinic","story":"The youngster ran out of the centre and scrambled up onto the top of the building where he stayed, refusing to climb down, for two hours.Dr Anik Sutari said she had never seen anything like it in all of her years of practice in the city of Serang on the Indonesian island of Java.She shared the photograph of the boys stunt on Facebook and admitted she had been stumped as to what to do.Dr Sutari said: Throughout my professional history, out of the  years I have been doing circumcisions and the thousands of children I have circumcised, this is the first time Ive seen a child flee to the top of the roof.She and the boys parents had been reluctant to follow the frightened youngster onto the roof in case he tried to run away and fell.Dr Sutari said that it was only after two hours that the parents thought to contact the boys schoolteacher who had a good relationship with him.She added: Its true...

I couldn’t sit up, I couldn’t open my eye, I had to pry it open.”It was then that she demanded her husband take her to the eye hospital.There, Lauren was told by medics that she had ulcers on her eye but docs couldnt say how theyd come to be there.However, samples from her eye later tested positive for Acanthamoeba keratitis - caused by a tiny parasite found in water.The infection is caused by a parasite that is usually found in bodies of water as well as taps, swimming pools, hot tubs, soil and air.Many dferent species of Acanthamoeba exist. Acanthamoeba organisms do not generally cause harm to humans , but they can cause a serious eye diseasethey infect the cornea.Symptoms can include:To avoid Acanthamoeba keratitis, never wear your contact lenses when youre coming into contact with water.Never wash contacts with tap water and never swim, shower or use a hot tub while wearing them.Always clean your contacts in lens solution the moment you take them out, or use daily disposables rather than monthlies.It was at the hospital that Lauren found out that she was pregnant, during what she called a waking nightmare.What should have been one of the happiest moments of her le quickly turned hellish, when docs told Lauren that the strong dosage of eye drops she was taking would probably result in foetal mutation.“I was a mess,” Lauren told Seven News.“The worst part was there were no definite answers.“I would ask ‘what’s going to happen ’ and they would just reply with ‘maybe this or maybe that’.”But, miraculously, Lauren made a complete recovery and was cleared of the parasite in June - six months after her nightmare began.She has no loss of sight and her baby is totally healthy.Docs still dont know what caused the parasite but Lauren admits that she must have gone swimming with her contacts in - although she doesnt remember doing so.“All of the pain and the risk of having permanent eye damage is not worth it,” Lauren said.“The whole experience was pure pain, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.Earlier this week, we reported the tragic story of Nick Humphreys, who has been left partially blind after showering in his contact lenses.Hes now working with the charity Fight for Sight, to raise awareness of the danger of using contact lenses in the shower or while swimming.He said: “I can honestly sayI’d had the slightest idea that this was even a remote possibility I would never have worn contacts in the first place. It’s crucial that people out there know this is a reality and it can happen because of something as simple as getting in the shower.He said: “I’ve lost  months of my le because of something as simple as showering with contacts in. If I get my sight back I’ll never wear contacts again.Hes now having to wait for a cornea transplant and vows to never wear contacts again.According to a poll by YouGov for the sight charity,  per cent of contact lens wearers wear their contacts for longer than the recommended  hours a day, with  per cent saying theyd swum or showered in them. per cent said they had slept with contacts in, and  per cent said theyd put their contacts in their mouth to clean or lubricate them."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may admits she never felt at home in downing street","story":"The outgoing leader said she “won’t miss being on call all the time” when she steps down later this month.While she and hubbie Philip are looking forward to moving out of No and escaping back to their Berkshire home.Speaking about le inside No, Mrs May, , told BBC News: “Well it’s very convenient.

I am the happiest I have ever been, we love travelling and have been to Italy, Greece and Spain together. People tend to stare but we actually love it, we find it hilarious that people have nothing better to do. He is always there for me and gives me advice when I need it. Other couples feel intimated by us as we are so in love and get on like a house on fire.    The pair intend on travelling more but one day hope to get married and start a family of their own. Chris said: Initially, I was nervous but flattered that a girl who is half my age has shown an interest in me. Before meeting I thought we would never see each other again but after a few hours of getting to know each other, I started getting butterflies and a desire to see Katie again. We spent the night together and to my surprise Katie felt the same. I have never dated a younger girl before but Katie makes me feel so alive as she is so outgoing and loving.

While they did arrest two men at the property and said they found a numerous amount of drugs, the real takeaway was the filthy state of the house. Photos of the squalid home show rubbish piled almost as high as the ceiling and a staircase rotten close to the point of falling down, Hull Daily Mail reported. Bags of human faeces wrapped in tin foil were found hanging from the backs of doors close to toilets caked in filth.    It appeared the houseaposs occupants had been sleeping on a chair surrounded by the squalor. The filth continued into the back garden, where dumped shopping trolleys, televisions and fridges lay around four cars, one of which was a Rolls Royce.

The house was in such disrepair the ten raiding officers were unable to search upstairs.    Since the police intervention Hull City Council moved to close the house off. This is a great outcome for us, PC Greenwood continued. Not only have we secured and closed a house but we have two in custody and found drugs.    “It’s a great feeling to know we have done our job for the community and sorted what has been a problem for them for years. “The men in custody will now have access to our nurses and doctors, and help for any mental health needs.” Residents living in the street spoke of their ongoing issues with the propertyaposs occupants.    One man, who said he knew the occupants from  years ago, said: The woman who once owned the house was salt of the earth, and would go to church every Sunday.

We’re pretty normal people and I just thought this is really bad karma.” And it wasn’t just the fears for her daughter’s future, but having been through it once, Noreen knew all too well how quickly treatment would ravage her daughter’s body.  “She was just weeks from getting her first communion and I knew what was ahead,” she recalls. “I knew she’d be on steroids straight away and that her dress wasn’t going to fit her and that she’d start losing her hair.” However, Noreen and her husband made a decision to turn Kate’s cancer battle into a more positive experience and they made a promise to their daughter. “We told her that while it wasn’t going to be easy we would make it as tolerable for her as we could and we really focused heavily on the positive” she explains. “For every nasty procedure or awful chemo she had to go through we did something for her, we organised for her to meet Picture This, she went to see Niall Horan, I got some of the rugby lads to see her.“When she would go into hospital for a longer stay I’d go with her and we’d do up her whole room in fairy lights and bring all her cuddly toys and her favourite blankets and make it really homely, those things for a little girl made a huge dference.”It is ironic, Noreen admits, but for Kate, the last two and a half years of her cancer treatment now hold some of the best memories of her le.  “Those bad memories are now also mixed up with all these great memories. She kept all these fantastic momentos from the last two years and now at the end of it all she would actually tell you she had a good time because we really made a huge effort to make it that way,” Noreen explains.  Kate admits: “We were the lucky ones up there. Kate and James cancers were the preferable cancers to have. “There are children we met along the way that didn’t make it, that is a nightmare, and it’s so hard to say to someone in that position to try and stay positive, but I know for a fact that the children feed from their parents positivity andthey feel secure and see you saying it’s ok, I do believe it helps them when things are really rough.” While it may sound strange to some, Noreen also admits there was a sense of comfort in it being the second time the family were dealing with cancer. She said: “This time as a family we were much more prepared for it, and myself and my husband were more together and stronger and we were more hopeful because we could say we’ve done this once and we’ve a gorgeous healthy son so we can do this a second time, she’ll be fine.” Fast forward to today and Kate is now finishing her treatment after two and a half years and has had her last chemo, while older brother James is now  and happy and healthy.

Sarah Mennell, , has hit back after being trolled by cruel strangers for naming her son and daughter Tiamarie and Jackdaniel. But she said she and her children arenapost bothered by the name mocking and are used to any negativity. The mum-of-five, from Hull, said she chose them because people “can’t all have boring names”. There are poignant reasons behind each of her five childrenaposs names, including the names of her other kids, Sydneyrae, Princess and Albert, reports Hull Live. But despite two of the names sounding like alcoholic spirits, Sarah said the children are NOT in fact named after drinks.  She said Jackdaniel, , is named after a Canadian runner and Tiamarie, , is named after a Spanish waitress. The mumaposs unusual choice of names for her children came to light after she made headlines for revealing she spends £ on each of their unorms.  Sarah, who runs Hull Party Services alongside husband Steve, said: We didn’t just pluck them out of thin air one night after a drink. No alcohol or drinks are behind the kidsapos names. We didn’t drink until around five months ago, when we decided to start having one night out as a married couple a month, so we are definitely not alcoholics.  We are just a hard working family who literally like a twist in names, nothing special about it and not alcohol related. But it’s surprising how quick people are to judge. But now we just laugh it off and run with it. It’s quite the conversation starter when were out and about usually, but it’s actually surprising how many boys are called Jackdaniel in some way or another and we know quite a few Tiamaries now. Sarah said Tiamarie was named after the couple, who have been married for  years, had their first family holiday together. She said: Tiamarie was actually decided on our first family holiday as a waitress was called Tiamarie in Spain. It was Spanish and my husbandaposs parents Caroline and Albert used to go quite a lot so we decided on Tiamarie.  We didnapost know at first, as Tia Maria is the drink, not Tiamarie, we just thought it’s dferent, not the normal names flying around everywhere, but the names stuck and we werenapost going to change it to please others. Discussing the reasoning behind calling her son Jackdaniel, she said: Jackdaniel is named after an athlete. When we were having Jack I don’t know I was pregnant. I went into hospital bleeding and it didn’t look good, he was a fighter and even though I was bleeding his legs was kicking like mad on the scan, so he got his name from the great running coach Jackdaniel because he survived this and is here today.    We thought it was funny because the team would put apospowered by Jackdanielapos on their backs. Jackdaniel knows this and always has. And funnily enough he is a runner and recently did the Humber Half Marathon for his rugby team. Some critics said their children would never be taken seriously when they were older, in job interviews for example, due to their names. Sarah hit back and said: Iaposm not worried how his name would appear to others, he gets Jak, Jack, JD, but when meeting new people he addresses them with his full name, Jackdaniel.  No one forgets their names easily and the kids have middle names double barrelled so it’s up to them what name they would like to be called. On paperwork or applications when he is older, he would simply use Mr JD Thomas Mennell. Tiamarie Louise can be used as Tia or Marie or Louise, it’s her choice, her close friends call her Tia. The amount of unusual names used now it’s nothing new, it’s just times are changing and so are names. Tiamarie is actually doing really well at school,  per cent attendance and comes home with awards every week. She is attending the prestigious awards ceremony at Hull City Hall next week as she has been nominated for an award and her grades have improved, she has been moved up in classes, all with help from Kingswood.  The couple also have two younger daughters, Sydneyrae, , who was also named after a young footballer - Sydney Rae Dwyer, and Princess, six. Sarah added: Princess was named Princess because we liked the name. It just stuck during pregnancy because we used to watch Little Princess on Channel  with the younger children at the time. My husband would sing it all the time and my baby would kick at the theme tune when it was on so Princess was born. Also Princess was born in a full amniotic sac so was very special and rare which we joked about, saying apostypical Princessapos.  Originally she was going to be called Bella, but we joked about her being a little princess so that name stuck, Princess Bella-vie vie which means aposachieve something.apos The coupleaposs youngest child Albert, four, is named after his late grandfather. Sarah continued: Albert Henry is named after his grandfather who passed away before he was born and didn’t get to see him. He died of cancer after an  year battle. Albert actually told me I was pregnant and we joked and saidit’s a boy we would call him after him so, in memory of him, he was called Albert Henry like his grandfather and his great grandfather so that family name was always kept.  Albert is a jack the lad, his name suits him and he is so pleasant, he gets told he looks like an Albert all the time. Despite the recent ridicule, Sarah said she would never want to change their names. She also said her and her family have not let the cruel comments online bother them. Our family motto is be kind to others, don’t judge and entertain and make people smile and we know while people are laughing and commenting on the names, butpeople met and actually know them, the names really suit them, she said. If I could turn back time and change the names I wouldn’t.    Some people online couldnapost help but comment on the unusual names after Sarah made headlines for revealing she spends £ on each of their unorms. Soma said: Tiamarie and Jackdaniel  Are you serious !! We rescued a dog called JD and changed it as we thought it was naff. Poor kids. Another wrote: Mummy should have invested in better names. WkdBlue, RedStripe and AppleSourz have future CEO written all over them *eyeroll* Luke Dunn said: “Their dad Johnny Walker works long hours. He also Fosters two kids called Stella and Glen Fiddich. Lovely family”.  Sarah spoke out earlier this week following a campaign to reduce the cost of unorms to make it poverty proof. Tiamarie joined Kingswood Academy in Hull last year and her eldest son, Jackdaniel, joins this September. Having purchased their full branded unorms, including PE kits, the mum has spent more than £ each. Sarah said: I personally think the price is reasonable. The full Kingswood unorm with rugby tops, shorts, tracksuit, rugby socks, ties and all shoes are around £ in total. It’s an investment in their education. If the kids feel smart and look smart it really helps them and it helps them fit in. The unorm campaign has gained support from parents who urge schools to cut the cost of unorm by removing the requirement to use branded, more expensive items.

Yes, their parents have a responsibility. But so do the rest of us. We are failing a generation by allowing them to feast on junk food. We have allowed big firms to pump their products full of salt and sugar, and then use huge advertising budgets to target these unhealthy drinks and snacks at children.

I think every girlaposs dream is to find that special guy and get married, Sarah recalled in new Channel  documentary Holiday Love Cheats. I just felt special and wanted.    Despite Sarahaposs attempts to put the brakes on their relationship, Haithem insisted on marrying her on his birthday on November . On the day of their wedding they had known each other for just half a year. When Sarah fell ill with a kidney problem, the couple decided that they should move to the UK, with his visa application eligible for the fast track because he would be her carer. Once she had stumped up for the visa, the wedding and the flight, Sarah was £, out of pocket.

Elizabeth Amoaa, originally from Ghana but now living in Walsall, Birmingham, was diagnosed with uterus didelphys in  after spending years in pain without having any idea what was wrong. From the age of , the -year-old had been in and out of hospital with stomach pain but doctors had repeatedly dismissed her condition. It was only when she turned  did she finally get the answer she had spent years seeking. From that moment, Elizabeth underwent a total of seven surgeries in the space of just two years as well as suffering a missed miscarriage which almost killed her. She is now speaking out about her condition in the hope of raising awareness for other women in a similar situation.    Elizabeth, whose vagina is Y-shaped with two vaginal canals that leads to two uteruses and two wombs, tells : “My periods were always very heavy. I used to complain a lot about abdomen pain but when my mother took me to the hospital doctors just kept giving me iron supplements and multivitamins and just said I was anaemic or had a yeast infection. “So I just believed that and continued taking my supplements. In , Elizabeth moved to the UK from Ghana, where she got checked out under the NHS and was diagnosed with fibroids, which are non-cancerous growths in the wall of her uterus. She was also given the devastating news that conceiving a child would be dficult so was advised to stop taking the pill. The then -year-old said: “I was really shocked but at the same time I just dismissed it as I wasn’t ready to marry let alone have a baby. At the time, I was still at university so I didnapost take it seriously. I just wanted to focus on my career.”    During this time, her period symptoms got increasingly worse and the pain became unbearable. She suffered severe abdominal pain, would often collapse while out shopping and experience regular nose bleeds. Throughout this, sex was also incredibly painful for her. Elizabeth says: “Ever since I started being sexually active around , I always thought the pain was just psychological. That it was just me. “I’d often find certain positions very painful but because I didn’t know why, I would just change the position so I wouldn’t be uncomfortable.” In , Elizabeth was thrilled when she defied all odds and fell pregnant with her daughter. But she was not prepared for the emotional rollercoaster that would follow. “My pregnancy was not normal because I’d have a scan and doctors would say oh we can’t locate the child, then they would say the baby is fine, then they would say oh we can’t see the baby again”.  “No one knew I had a double womb at the time so it really was a tough time. Despite my daughter being born premature at  weeks, doctors still did not figure it out.” A major hint of her condition was that Elizabeth continued to get periods throughout her pregnancy. The -year-old, who previously worked for Lloyds bank before she was sacked because she was always off sick, says: “I would get admitted to hospital and they would say you haven’t had a  miscarriage so where is the blood coming from  They then put it down to the fibroids which they said were growing with the child. They kept concentrating on the fibroids and saying I had a low immune system but they didnapost really investigate any further.”    It was only later that Elizabeth found out that her daughter had survived because she had been in the right womb rather than in the heavily infected left womb. “This whole experience has been an emotional rollercaster. One second I was being told I wouldn’t be able to conceive, the next I’m giving birth to my daughter. “Though I’m blessed to have my daughter, I feel very upset and annoyed as they should’ve done a proper investigation. If there was an early intervention I wouldnapost have to gone through what I have today.” After Elizabeth gave birth to her daughter prematurely, the pain flooded back to the point where she struggled to go to the toilet. Doctors put it down to post-natal depression and prescribed her antidepressants. Uterus Didelphys means double uterus and is considered a rare congenital abnormality. One in about every , women worldwide have the condition. Typically, in a female fetus, a uterus starts out as two small tubes and usually joins together to create one larger hollow organ. In the case of uterus didelphys, the tubes donapost join completely and instead, each one develops into a separate structure. A double uterus may have one opening into one vagina, or each uterine cavity may have a cervix. It often causes no symptoms but can be very uncomfortable. Women who have a double uterus often have successful pregnancies but the condition can increase the risk of miscarriage or premature birth. Source: www.mayoclinic.org    The crunch point came when Elizabeth met her now-husband and the couple temporarily moved to Germany for his work, where they had access to private healthcare in . “Doctors over there investigated me and that’s when they diagnosed me with a double womb and double vagina after doing key-hole surgery, she said. “I was really overwhelmed because I finally got the answer to all my doubts about my health after all these years. It was really hard for me to take in and I was very upset. “I always knew something was wrong so to actually be diagnosed with something it was a little bit of a relief. “This whole time I thought I was going mad. People would always say why are you always sick  I knew they were thinking I was just making it up, that it was all in my head.    After her diagnosis doctors told Elizabeth that trying for a second child would be extremely risky and that she would have to be careful. Elizabeth agreed to have a Hysterosalpingogram, where dye is inserted in the womb of women who are struggling to get pregnant, three times over six months and eventually she was able to conceive again and get pregnant in December . But three months later, she was rushed to hospital after noticing black blood clots coming out of her.  Despite her stomach getting bigger and breasts becoming tender Elizabeth had in fact lost her baby very early on after suffering a apossilent miscarriageapos at eight weeks. She was told the fetus had got stuck in her womb and could have proved fatal to herit had stayed inside. Fortunately, Elizabeth, who now works for Birmingham City Council, was okay but she says the experience has left a mental scar on her for le.

Europa League home defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi, the duo committed their long-term future to Aberdeen until summer .Having been appointed Pittodrie manager in March  McInnes is the second longest serving manager in Scottish senior football, second only to Peterhead’s Jim McInally.He has rejected approaches from both Sunderland and Rangers to manage them during his time in the Granite City.However, it remains a source of frustration to McInnes that he has yet to add to the League Cup trophy secured in .McInnes said: “Aberdeen is a club I have grown to love and I continue to love.“On my first day at Pittodrie I talked about how I wanted to bring success to the club and deliver trophies.“About how I would be hellbent on making sure that was the case.“Now as I sit here six and a bit years on it is still the most important thing to me, to try to bring success to this club.”McInnes confirmed to the Evening Express in May he would be open to penning a new contract.Chairman Stewart Milne opened up discussions soon after on an extension to the contract which expired in .However it was put on the back-burner with the immediate focus on recruiting players during McInnes’ biggest summer rebuild since arriving at the club.McInnes said: “When the chairman approached me towards the end of last season it was something we said would get done once I got a few players in.“We wanted to make sure that was done first, that was the most important part.”McInnes has secured seven new signings during the summer transfer window and will add to that with the addition of a midfielder.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd drubbing for league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArdnamurchan Women#s Camanachd AssociationDunadd ladies closed in on the top of the table with a thumping win against the league leaders.The Mid Argyll girls travelled to Spean Bridge for the game against undefeated Ardnamurchan but proved too strong for the home team.The game started evenly, but two early goals from top goal scorer Eilidh Cameron settled Dunadd.Against the run of play, however, Ardnamurchan broke away and scored, giving the home team hope and momentarily shaking Dunadd.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

Its dominance was largely the result of its proximity to Glasgow and abundance of local resources, including fresh water, peat, coal and locally grown barley.In the th century, it was home to about  distilleries, leading it to be known as #Whiskyopolis# and developing a distinct style of whisky reflective of its remote location.The early day motion can be read in full at: https:edm.parliament.uk early-day-motion  campbeltown-and-the-whiskiest-place-in-the-world-campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"kintyre book launch shows potential for literary festival","story":"A Breath on Dying Embers is the latest addition to Denzil#s fictional crime series, of which two million copies have been sold worldwide since the launch of Whisky From Small Glasses in .The series follows the trials and tribulations of DCI Jim Daley in Kinloch, a fictional town based on Campbeltown.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"feel-like-meet-elvis","story":"Itrsquos an enduring memory and something Irsquoll never forget.

Pan Am airlines ndash probably not entirely seriously ndash took the reservation, and the journalist paid a deposit roughly equivalent to twenty dollars. The story attracted headlines, and Pan Am, knowing good publicity when it saw it, launched its First Moon Flights Club. Official cards were issued to members.Pan Ams futuristic space plane Orion III, seen in the  sci-fi classic film, : A Space Odyssey, seemed to bring the prospect of commercial Moon flights ever closer. On July , two days after man walked on the Moon, it was reported that some , people, including  Scots, had asked Pan Am and Trans World airlines to book them seats on the first commercial Moon flights.Pan Am had informed applicants that it had no idea of the cost or other relevant details. \"We have always treated the inquiries seriously because there is no telling what will happen, said a spokesman.

Apollo  launched from Cape Kennedy on July , and when, four days later, Armstrong stepped from the Eagle lunar module with the words \"...one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" some  million television viewers were giddy with excitement. The sense of wonder ndash that humanity had actually walked on a distant celestial body ndash was nothing short of profound.Herald reader Russell Smith relates: \"Along with the death of King George V when school lessons were stopped in the afternoon for the news, Suez, Bannisterrsquos sub- minute mile, and the assassination of President Kennedy, those of my generation , will never forget the amazement at the technological development of the  Moon landing, the pictures, commentary, and the successful . My elder daughterjust remembers being told, Yoursquore going to see something amazing, the man on the Moon.\"Mr Smith has two interesting souvenirs of that epic time ndash a Man on the Moon dish-towel, and a special presentation pack, Touchdown on the Moon, which included everything from Apollo s flight plan to press briefings, lunar excursion orders and even a  record, Man on the Moon, which includes voices of the NASA announcer and the astronauts.\"It was July  and the words, This is one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, were about to become part of modern history,\" begins Moira Strachans contribution to Scottish Book Trustrsquos Stories of Home campaign . \"Whenever I hear those words now I am transported back to that time when, strangely perhaps, I shared my home in Greenock with a number of American sailors. No round-the-clock news coverage then: only the print headlines, the radio and the  orsquoclock news, but the air was ringing with the sounds of whooping and hollering as they celebrated, loudly and patriotically, Neil Armstrongrsquos achievement of being the first man to step on the moon.\"Strachan, who is now retired, was  then: home was the Inverclyde Sailorsrsquo Centre on Dalrymple Street, where her father was the manager. Around  Americans lived there while their Holy Loch base across the Clyde was being refurbished.\"The excitement of the Moon landing stretched over several days,\" recalls Herald reader Gordon Casely. \"I worked for Evening Express in Aberdeen and ndash unusually for an evening paper ndash news of the moonshot and subsequent landing appeared on Page  across all of our editions. I happened to be at home during the actual landing, listening to live coverage on the radio, and well recall Neil Armstrongrsquos words crackling over my bonnie big multi-valve radio. So thrilled was I that I phoned my parents in Edinburgh, and held the phone to the radio so that they could hear voices all the way from space.\"For us on the paper,\" he adds, \"the Moon landing had all hands to the plough. When news broke early one afternoon that the astronauts were having dficulty sleeping in their capsule, editor Bob Smith re-plated Page  halfway through the final edition print-run. Thus the paper landing on the streets for the five orsquoclock homeward rush bore the single heading MOONSOMNIA!\"In the early hours of the st, the Glasgow Herald had acute problems with deadlines for its first edition. In his history of the paper, Alastair Phillips says everything was in place, including a banner headline, Man lands on the Moon. The start-button just needed to be pressed that would get the presses rolling. But Armstrong, writes Phillips, was being unconscionably slow about coming down the ladder. Until he set foot on the Moon, the chief sub-editor had the incongruously attentive but far-away look of the man who was mulling over the possibility of a more depressing headline and opening paragraph.Herald View: Apollo  Moon Landing was humankinds greatest breakthrough, but our next must be closer to homeThe machine-room manager warned the editor, Alastair Warren, that he could only give him another five minutes, otherwise the edition would not go out in time and would miss distribution vans. Armstrong remained poised on the ladder, six feet above the surface. The Herald staff were getting desperate. Phillips himself said the presses should roll, but not a single copy must leave the place until you get the all-clear from this phone. The presses were picking up speed when Armstrong stepped off the ladder.The updated headline for the second edition read, MAN WALKS ON THE MOON: Astronauts go exploring after perfect landing in Sea of Tranquillity, alongside an artists impression of Armstrong on the lunar surface.\"A new age dawned at .am yesterday morning when Neil Armstrong stepped on to the Moon,\" began the Herald leader on July . \"Historians may judge that modern times have ended, and the space age has begun.\"ldquoI was  when the first manned Moon landing took place,\" says the Rt Rev Colin Sinclair, the current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. \"I remember being allowed to stay up very late to watch it happen.ldquoIt was nearly am before Neil Armstrong put his foot on the surface of the Moon. I was very tired but it was all very exciting. His well-known words, \"one small step for man, one giant step for mankind\" were actually quite dficult to hear and their impact only came later when they were repeated the following morning on the news.ldquoAt the time you felt that human beings could do anything they set their minds to. We thought that was the beginning of the exploration of the planets. Sadly, three years later, the whole project would stop.This memory, from Basia Palka from Poznan, Poland, comes courtesy of the Glasgow Science Centre, which is staging several special events to mark the th anniversary. \"I arrived in Scotland in  after being put on a train in Poznan aged  by my grandfather. I travelled to the UK by myself and was met at Harwich by my mum whom I had not seen for two years. I was brought to a single end in the Gorbals.\"We had a black-and-white TV and on the day of the Moon landing some of the neighbours piled in to the one room to watch this bit of history in the making. At that point in time I had no English but I understood that this was an amazing moment.\"I was in empathy with the astronauts who had taken such a trip as I felt that I, too, had taken an enormous journey to get here to Glasgow all by myself with a name tag round my neck, not unlike Paddington Bear.\"I remember it well when I had put my foot down on British soil for the first time as I watched the first astronaut putting his foot down on the surface of the moon.We had this much in common we had taken a ginormous journey.Theirs had been a bit longer than mine.\"Dr Alistair Ramsay MBE remembers: \"I was a student working as a silver-service waiter in the Atholl Palace Hotel in Pitlochry. \"Normally the waiters ate their meals in one part of the hotel but the lsquobluersquo staffhad their own dining room and they got chips. Waiters normally werenrsquot allowed into the blue staff dining room but I had started in the hotel as a kitchen porter before being promoted to the dining room, so I was allowed in. On the day of the Moon landing I went to the blue staff dining room and watched \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" while stuffing my face with chips. A big argument was raging about whether or not it was a massive con but watching on a black and white TV it was still very impressive!\"Scots-born former airline pilot Bill Innes, author of Flight from the Croft, remembers: \"Like all pilots I was fascinated by the Moon landing and watched as much as I could on the ghostly telly pictures of the time. It is absolutely amazing what was achieved with the primitive computers of those days. Eight years later I had the privilege of watching aDelta rocket launch a satellite from Cape Canaveral and that was impressive enough. The Americans had every right to have their breasts swell with patriotic pride.\"He added: \"Even in  when the first glass cockpit Bs and s appeared, their computer power was a fraction of that of a modern smartphone. The only advantage my job gave me was that a darkened cockpit is a great place to catch satellites and space stations tracking across the night sky.\"Another Herald reader, Sandy, from Stirling, who is in his eighties, says: \"I remember sitting in the lounge of the old Golf Hotel in Elie, watching a small television screen with all the other guests and my we and little daughter around midnight that day. My we was pregnant with our son and at that time she had thoughts about calling him Neil.\"In the event, they went with another name, but some couples were sufficiently inspired by the Moon landing to christen a new-born after one of the astronauts, among them a couple in Monieth, who named their son after all three. A couple in Toledo, Ohio, christened their new baby boy Neil Armstrong. Their surname  Moon.It is fair to say, however, that not everyone was overwhelmed by what happened in July . Herald reader Thelma Edwards remembers that she shunned the entire event: \"I refused offers from family members to view the whole thing on their TV sets. This was all due to what had happened to Laika, the dog that Russia sent into space in . She died very soon after the launch and I was steaming mad. What right had we to use animals for these purposes  Perhapswhat happened to Laika, and several other animals, hadnrsquot happened I might have felt dferently about the whole thing. We have made a mess of this planet so we should stay on it and put it right, not go spreading our mess on other planets. I subscribe to the ideas in James Lovelockrsquos book Gaia ndash The Practical Science of Planetary Medicine.As much as the Moon landing dominated the newspapers , space still had to be found for other stories, from home and abroad: the incident at Chappaquiddick, Massachusetts, when a car driven by US Senator Teddy Kennedy plunged off a bridge, and his -year-old passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, died trapped inside the vehicle.In Glasgow, there were  arrests on the first day of the Glasgow Fair police said such a start was normal, or even quieter than usual. Police were investigating the murder of -year-old Rachel Ross, in an armed robbery in Ayr. Police wanted to interview James Grfiths in connection with her death, but he went on a rampage, shooting and wounding  peoplebefore being shot dead by a police officer. Paddy Meehan was subsequently convicted of murdering Mrs Ross, but he received a royal pardon in .Jackie Stewart won the British Grand Prix, just  hours after a mph crash in practice. He went on to become world champion that year.In Scottish cinemas, the big movies included The Love Bug, Oliver!, Oh! What a Lovely War, and Ring of Bright Water.

Bible Johns second victim, Jemima McDonald, would be found dead in August.Dr Archibald B Roy, then a senior lecturer in astronomy at Glasgow University, won pound, as a result of an pound Moon-landing bet he had made on a visit to America five years earlier. A -year-old in Preston won pound, on a similar ,-to- bet. Betting odds shortened dramatically on there being a manned landing on Mars before . Postcards franked at Cape Canaveral on Apollo s blast-off day sold out in Britain. ldquoWe have been overwhelmed with the demand, said the marketing manager at John Menzies  Co, in Edinburgh.The landing, and Armstrong and Aldrins walkabout, received substantial coverage on the BBC and ITV. Six South Africans paid pound each to travel to London to watch the broadcasts. Crime in Italy during the night dropped to one-third of its normal levels. ITVs Man on the Moon programme, a seven-hour-long special fronted by David Frost, included entertainment spots from, amongst others, Lulu and Engelbert Humperdinck. Three days after the Moon landing, a number of people had to be rescued when their cabin cruiser, Apollo, got into dficulties in the Firth of Forth.After Armstrong and Aldrin,  other astronauts ndash Pete Conrad, Alan Bean, Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, David Scott, James Irwin, John Young, Charles Duke, Eugene Cernan, and Harrison Schmitt ndash walked on the lunar surface. Of the , just four are alive: Aldrin, Scott, Duke and Schmitt. But public and political fascination with deep-space exploration quickly faded.As The Herald noted on the th anniversary of Apollo , the topic suffered a \"drastic loss of interest and funds after , because it was then only a propaganda extravaganza with very limited practical benefits.\" Priorities suddenly, decisively, lay where: inflation, urban riots, the closing stages of the Vietnam war, the Middle East war, oil prices, Watergate.Herald View: Apollo  Moon Landing was humankinds greatest breakthrough, but our next must be closer to homeIn recent months, however, interest has been revived in the Moon.

Alcohol is strange. Often, its usage is related to stress and depression, both of which run rampant in the Mummy of Parliaments.But which man or woman of the world can deny that, after a rotten day, a large GT or dram can work wonders, settling down the mind and making one feel human again  Having been bossed around and bullied all day, the relaxed imbiber sticks his or her head out the window and shouts: ldquoYou can all go and procreate yourselves!Marvellous. The medical profession has nothing to equal this wonder drug. Indeed,you could bottle it, yoursquod be on to a fortune.Alcohol can also supply confidence and Dutch courage, which can come in handy where someone has to do something heroic like make a speech in a place full of rude, shouty people. Butever the expression ldquotoo much of a good thing made any sense itrsquos in relation to alcohol. With alcohol, everything quickly becomes all right and slowly becomes all wrong.The dficulty with drink is that one or two make you a god or sage, without the power or wisdom to know thatrsquos the point at which you should stop. The arithmetic of alcohol is that one or two leads to three or four.That mid-point where you should stop just as yoursquore starting to feel unnaturally happy is the most dficult thing for the human mind to master. Itrsquos like kung fu: the whole secret of which is to stay calm in the middle of a violent confrontation, which no one in the world can do ndash only a master .All that said, Irsquom not convinced alcohol is the sole reason for bullying at Westminster. It occurs in many other workplaces that donrsquot have several bars on the premises. Perhaps itrsquos to do with the sort of person who becomes an MP, someone who seeks power, the direction to which only becomes evident when one throws away onersquos moral compass.Irsquove never understood, or approved of, the arrogance behind any public speaking: the idea that everyone should listen to you. If you know anyone like this, Irsquod advise cutting all ties with them immediately.And yet itrsquos what politicians are all about. Itrsquos about people drunk on their own ego. I guess itrsquos true that drink makes this worse but, again, I wonderitrsquos the root cause of all the bad behaviour Doon There.In an odd, inverse way, todayrsquos widespread, prurient and hypocritical horror of drink only makes it more attractive. Thatrsquos human nature. In more sensible countries than ours, itrsquos acceptable to have a little pick-me-up at any time of the day.People who look back to the Seventies with fondness always single out the fact that it was quite common for people to go for a pint at lunchtime. The late Queen Mother liked a wee swallie as soon as the clock struck noon, and no evidence ever emerged of her getting into a fist-fight or walking around the palace with her pants on her heid.But perhaps, today, rather than having a civilised snter at periodic intervals, therersquos too much bingeing. It might be possible to have alarms go off whenever an MP demands that third killer drink. Or perhaps they could be fitted with smart watches that zap them electronically when they go over the score I dare say not. Besides, I still suspect itrsquos their personalities that require a sense of moderation.++++WE live, as you know, in times where abuse of Scotland from south of the border is as rampant as a lion, but even mentioning the ldquoE word up here is likely to lead to imprisonment.

They participated in the hijacking of a bill to keep Northern Ireland running in the absence of devolved government by using it to liberalise abortion law there and to legalise same-sex marriage. This was a coup carried out by the UKrsquos metropolitan elite and the SNPrsquos role in it was hypocritical and shameful.Nationalist MPs have always chosen never to vote on devolved matters affecting other parts of the UK, being aware that to do so undermines its opposition to any erosion of Holyroodrsquos devolved powers. Ian Blackford, the leader of the SNPrsquos Westminster group, airily waved away such pfling concerns. He said that the current uncertainty in Northern Ireland politics permitted his MPs to vote on amendments to the proposed bill. It will pass into lawNorthern Irelandrsquos main parties canrsquot restore power-sharing by October .:Holyrood could do with a few more mavericksLetrsquos talk frankly here. None of this stemmed from any authentic concern for the future of politics in Northern Ireland. If the amendments had been about any other issue the SNP would have stuck to what remains of its moral principles and kept their distance. Indeed,this had been about putting in place special measures to combat the effects of a No-Deal Brexit in Northern Ireland, you might even make a case for the SNP using the lsquospecial circumstancesrsquo justication to vote on them. This though, was about something more sinister. It was about imposing a social and cultural diktat on a country which has always rejected the secularist and anti-Christian orthodoxy which fuels the political agenda in Scotland. The SNP chose to wait until Scotlandrsquos neighbour was at its weakest and in need of genuine assistance to insult and humiliate them.In any other constituent part of the UK there would have been an outcrylegislators from outwith their jurisdiction had sought to drive through changes in these sensitive areas without any consultation. There was no prior discussion with any of Northern Irelandrsquos elected representatives and no notice that such changes were being mooted. Instead they chose to treat this country with utter contempt and accord it the serf status that the British Empire once reserved for its minion states. The SNP, self-proclaimed s of enlightened, inclusive and progressive politics, were part of this.They must have known that  per cent of people in Northern Ireland, according to a recent ComRes poll, are opposed to the UK making a legislative intervention such as this. The Lib-Dem peer, Lord David Alton, speaking in the Lords this week, said: ldquoWe have always treated Northern Ireland not as having to be in unormity but as being dferent and having dferent cultural values. The law on abortion in Northern Ireland, with its distinct traditions and identity, is something about which many people in Northern Ireland hold a very dferent view from the views of the English metropolitan classes.These classes also exist in Scotland and drive the Holyrood agenda. Part of this is conducting a well-organised and well-funded campaign of legal harassment against those who profess authentic Christianity and not the platitudinous and fey facsimile of it that our Government would like it to be. Thus, anyone who holds the belief that an unborn child is the most vulnerable member of the human race and has an equal right to le as all other humans is dismissed as extremist and sexist. Those who believe that the sacrament of marriage is reserved for a man and a woman are hounded by the SNPrsquos social media jackals and accused of homophobia. Each is a chillingly well-constructed and implacably-pursued lie.:Boris Johnsons tax plans could spell disasterMany Christians were among those who voted for Scotland to be an independent country. We donrsquot believe that Scotland has a higher set of values than England or even that the country necessarily will be better governed or be economically better off. We just believe that independence is Scotlandrsquos natural state itrsquos what God intended this country to be,itrsquos still permissible to deploy a ine lexicon in modern Scotland. The SNP though seems bent on harrying many of its supporters to a place where they are forced to choose between the party and their faith. For many, the Christian faith is the bedrock of their political beliefs. In a secular society we recognise the primacy of the state but we expect the state into let us practise our faith without retribution.Instead, we are seeing the emergence of a hostile environment for Christians where midwives are disciplined for refusing to carry out abortions social workers likewise for refusing to place children with same-sex couples and church members are barred from sitting on local authority bodies. In the background is the constant drumbeat of attacks on Catholic schools. Diversity  Inclusiveness  There are many in the SNP who are strangers to these concepts when they apply to Scotlandrsquos Christian community.Kevin McKenna: Whatever happened to Ruth Davidsons Tory revival There are also profound political consequences flowing from the SNPrsquos hypocrisy and cowardice in its Northern Ireland power grab. This will haunt them in any future referendum. It suggests that its leadership is more concerned with imposing its militant social ideology on Scotland than with making it independent. Itrsquos currently seeking to persuade un-decided voters about the advantages that come with independence even as it stamps all over the independence of its neighbours. In doing so they have just provided a gt to Unionists and betrayed the wider Yes movement."},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-capaldi-vs-noel-gallagher","story":"Itrsquos not the first time the pair have clashed with Gallagher calling Capaldirsquos music ldquof*****g w***k in a radio interview in June before the cheeky Scot entertained his fans ndash and won many more ndash by swaggering onto Glastonburyrsquos Other Stage wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the older Gallagher brotherrsquos face.Lewis, who Lewis Capaldi was born in Glasgow and brought up in Whitburn, West Lothian.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmCOMPETITION: The Orcadian has teamed up with the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland to offer readers the chance to win one of  pairs of tickets for the NYOS Symphony Orchestra’s performance in the Pickaquoy Centre on Wednesday, August .

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But that may be about to change.The Flow Country in Caithness and Sutherland is around , square miles of m deep peat and boggy pools that has been growing since the end of the last Ice Age more than , years ago.If a bid under way is successful, it could become the UK’s rd World Heritage Site, joining the likes of Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns, the Forth Bridge, Stonehenge and the Lake District.It was first named on the “tentative list” of UK World Heritage Sites in , but has so far been overlooked, with the Government instead putting forward others for consideration by Unesco. The team behind the Flow Country’s latest bid believe its long wait for recognition will soon come to an end, partly due to its timing coinciding with calls for radical action on climate change.Widely considered to be the largest area of blanket bog in the world, it is capable of storing m tonnes of carbon dioxide – more than every tree in the UK put together.Deep peatlands are the perfect natural ally in the fight against climate change as they slow down the carbon breakdown process, stopping it from being released into the atmosphere.The same factors – high acidity and a lack of oxygen – also explains the phenomenon of “bog people”, well preserved human cadavers found in similar bogs thousands of years after their deaths.“There’s a consensus that this is the best peatland of its type anywhere in the world,” says Joe Perry, who is co-ordinating the Flow Country bid. “There’s nothing to compare with it. We consider it the Amazon of peatlands or the Great Barrier Reef of peatlands.” He says the time is ripe for global recognition of the bog in the wake of the UK committing to achieve net zero emissions by .“[Peatlands] are the most effective natural carbon store,” he adds. “It’s just an extraordinarily efficient and effective way of keeping that harmful stuff out of our atmosphere.”The Flow Country is also home to rare birds, including the golden plover, dunlin and curlew, and has fresh water pearl mussels.The bid was ramped up last weekend with a series of local events featuring high profile backers, including archaeologist and television historian Neil Oliver and geologist Professor Iain Stewart.Oliver, who is also president of the National Trust for Scotland, describes the bog as a “mysterious corner of the country” that is “remote even to most Scots”. “I would guessyou were to stop  people on Princes Street in Edinburgh or Buchanan Street in Glasgow and ask them about the Flow Country, the majority would struggle,” he says. Mr Perry adds: “It’s one of the few places you can go to where you can turn  degrees and not see anything built by a human. It’s an incredible place.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why public transport is vital to ensure equality for all michael mcewan","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...For many people, even though public transport plays a big part in their daily lives, they may not give it much thought unless there#s a problem. Butyou have a disability, it can be challenging to find accessible public transport across Scotland, writes Michael McEwan.Aside from my research as a journalist, I’ve first-hand knowledge of this in my role as chair of my local disability group, East Renfrewshire Disability Action . We recently ran a campaign to address the lack of accessible taxis. Once there was just one fully accessible taxi in East Renfrewshire, but after six years of meetings with the council and steering groups to show them the need for more, there are now -plus accessible cabs registered in the area.At national level, an accessible travel framework is in process to ensure people with a disability have the absolute right to live a le of equal opportunities – the ability to travel being an important enabler of those opportunities.This framework has been co-produced by the National Transport Accessibility Steering Group, which includes local government, Transport Scotland and people with a disability. The main purpose is to support disabled people’s rights by removing barriers and improving access to travel. Issues being addressed include getting on and off a bus, train or ferry etc, accessible travel information, getting to transport facilities, staff attitudes and transferring between dferent modes of transport. The group has been working together to gather knowledge, advice and the lived experiences of disabled people, as well as people currently working in the public transport sector.: Scottish Greens call for ‘free public transport across Europe’: We must learn from pasttransport is to succeed in future – John YellowleesThe main focus to ensure co-operation between disabled people and transport sector staff continues, the hope is to effect real change. There have been a number of problems highlighted recently in the UK media, including a young man from Troon who was left stranded on a train miles from home due to the absence of a pre-booked ramp on board and the shocking story of a paraplegic man who had to drag himself through Luton Airport after his self-propelling wheelchair was left behind on a flight. But there are hopeful signs too.Edinburgh-based company Neatebox has designed an app for people with reduced mobility and hidden disabilities to help them get the assistance they need at Edinburgh Airport. The app sends a signal to the airport’s Passengers with Reduced Mobilityreception area to noty staff that the passenger is on their way, to enable them to prepare for their arrival and offer a personal and respectful service. Founded in  by former guide dog mobility instructor, Gavin Neate, Neatebox looks to improve the lives of disabled people through the use of smart technology. Edinburgh also recently became the first airport in Scotland to be recognised as autism friendly.On the rail network, ScotRail has teamed up with Interpreter Now to introduce a new British Sign Languageapp to Scotland’s railways, a first for the UK industry. Interpreter Now is a service that delivers immediate access to online interpreting for BSL users, enabling deaf and hearing people to communicate. Users connect via a video call to an interpreter who can relay the customer’s query to members of staff. The interpreter then signs the answer.While it is encouraging to see the development of disability support network and apps within the public transport system, there is still much work to be done to ensure that people with a disability have the confidence to move freely and safely around the country.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"would you pass this test of honesty jim duffy","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...An #honesty bar# in a boutique hotel in Spain has made Jim Duffy think about the nature of truth.“Honesty is the always best policy” should be the main mantra for the way we live our lives. Whether that be honesty with ourselves, our work colleagues, relationships, companies we deal with online or simply telling our children the truth.It seems this mantra is not what we are getting from some of our politicians, who like to be economical with the truth, albeit for them, they are being honest. But, for the large majority of us, we try our best to live our lives as “honestly” as we can. We pay our bills on time. We do not pinch milk from Sainsbury’s self-service checkout. We do not do a runner from the petrol station.All this came into sharp focus for me this week when I was presented with an honesty bar. The results were a little blurred.I’d come across honesty bars before. Unlike a traditional bar where one would order some drinks then hand over cash or a card, an honesty bar has no-one minding the till. There is no ‘bar’ as such or anyone preventing you from direct access to drink. The gantry and fridge is open for business and you are the sole arbiter of how well the bar does at the end of the night. In short, either you are honest and pay for the drinks you have consumed or you try to shave off a little mixer or dram here or there. The whole honesty bar process and concept tells you a lot about you.: I don’t read novels. Am I normal  – Jim Duffy: Why sometimes it’s okay to telllies to your partner – Jim DuffySo, how did I fair  Checking into a lovely boutique hotel in the Spanish mountains is the stuff dreams are made of – € a night for the most breathtaking views and small well-equipped room that made me feel I was straight out the book, A Year in Provence. Mind you, when I asked our Spanish hoststhey had read it or spent any time in France, the look said it all – non. Everything was perfect for our one-night stay to celebrate my birthday. It was literally picture postcard stuff with a set menu for dinner. Then the owner dropped the bomb on me when he showed us the Honesty Bar.The bar itself was a very swish wooden-built bar with fridges built in. There were large compartments, each with their own specic spirits. The gin compartment housed ten ied bottles of gin. So too the vodka, brandy, rum and, of course my favourite, whisky. There was a multitude of wine ieties, where the bottles themselves were works of art. The fridges contained a plethora of beers from all over he world as well as ice, cut fruit and mixers for the drinks.Everything was as it should be, with elegant glasses for wine and heavy tumblers for that gorgeous dram. There was a little receipt pad located on one of the surfaces with a pen, to record what we had consumed. To record what we had consumed ...  This wonderful bar was like an Aladdin’s Cave of drink and possibility. And it was mine to explore before dinner and, of course, it would still be there afterwards.But, despite feeling elated at full exposure to this candy shop of alcohol, there was something niggling at me – the receipt pad. It wasn’t free and gratis. It was up to me to be honest about what I would take. But, alas, there was no-one there to check. No-one there to monitor my tab. How would I fair and just how honest would I be I poured my partner a gin and tonic. Some strawberry affair with matching tonic. It all looked a bit posh as gin does these days. A simple “Gordons” has been replaced with a whole choir of gins including apple, orange and strawberry. A most competitive marketplace, I mused as my eyes were constantly drawn to the whiskies. I quickly decided on a good old Scottish malt. A Glenlivet with a single cube of ice. Mind you, I free-poured a large one – after all, that is what they do in Spain right  No optics or measures here. And who would check anyway  I duly noted one whisky and one gin on the receipt pad. Job done. Well done, to a extent ...We sat with our drinks and I savoured the moment. I watched as others used the honesty bar, pouring large drinks into tumblers. I watched them also tot up their rounds on their own receipts. Then it was off to dinner.The next morning after breakfast, our host enquired as to what drinks we had taken from the honesty bar  It seemed my rather bland attempt to obfuscate the exact brand of gin and whisky we had taken was not ideal.But, the big question is, did I try to cover up the fact that we had premium brands or was I simply being flippant with the receipt as it was not really going to be checked by HMRC  I took the receipt and re-entered exactly what we had taken by brand. And at that moment, I felt a slight pang of guilt. Why had I not been  per cent honest  Why did I treat the honesty bar with so little respect  As we checked out later, we paid our bill and – of course – our bar bill. Every item on the bar bill was now in ink and it looked very dferent from what I had jotted down the night before. Still feeling a little disheartened as we left, despite paying € for one round of drinks, I did question myself on why I simply did not record my drinks accurately at the honesty bar. Hey ho, I thought, one to ponder.But, it made me think about what “honesty” really means and when presented with choices in le, when honesty is at the fore of decision-making, what measure do we really use to be as honest as we can ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt i ll bring more shipbuilding work to scotland","story":"Jeremy Hunt has promised to safeguard Scotland#s shipbuilding industry by supporting further work at the country#s yardshe becomes prime minister, thanks to a proposed boost in the defence budget.The Tory leadership candidate and foreign secretary told The Scotsman he considered it his “duty” to ensure the country’s “proud shipbuilding” traditions continue for “as long as possible”. He stressed his commitment to hiking defence spending to . per cent of GDP – an increase of £ billion – would protect skilled jobs at the likes of Rosyth.The foreign secretary said the ongoing tensions in the Gulf, which will see Britain bolster its military presence in the region next week with the arrival of another warship amid rising tensions with Iran, demonstrated how the Royal Navy has been “run down too much” in recent decades.He has pledged to review Britain’s existing commitment of  destroyers and frigateshe succeeds Theresa May, with plans to look at whether extra Type  frigates of offshore patrol vessels are required. Mr Hunt told The Scotsman that by delivering a “historic funding boost” for the armed forces, it would benefit Scottish industry.He said: “As the son of a naval officer who was based in Rosyth for several years, I would view it as my duty to try and ensure the proud shipbuilding traditions of those docks continued for as long as possible.“Backed by my promise to increase the defence budget to . per cent of GDP, my government would support further shipbuilding in Scotland. He added: “My commitment would seek to protect skilled jobs by delivering more work to dockyards across the UK, including at Rosyth.”It is unclear how any increase in the navy’s complement would impact on shipyards on the Clyde.BAE’s yards in Govan and Scotstoun have a contract to build three Type  frigates. Initial talks are underway between the firm and the Ministry of Defence to construct a further five frigates, which would secure work in the area for the next two decades.Any additional production would likely require an increase in manufacturing capacity. The UK government’s next full-scale Strategic Defence and Security Review is due next year. It comes as Mr Hunt called for “cool heads” to prevail to ensure there was no “unintended escalation” in the Gulf.It was confirmed yesterday that HMS Duncan, a Type  destroyer that is in the Mediterranean, will next week join HMS Montrose – the frigate that drove off Iranian patrol boats attempting to impede the progress of a British tanker. While HMS Montrose will eventually be relieved for maintenance work and crew changes, it is expected the two ships will be present in the region for a spell amid growing concerns over Iranian threats to disrupt shipping in the strategically important waterway.The Ministry of Defence said the move “will ensure that the UK alongside international partners can continue to support freedom of navigation for vessels transiting through this vital shipping lane”.Mr Hunt said: “We have a responsibility to protect British shipping and, with our allies, to protect the waterways and seaways of the world, so we have to react according to the threats that we face.“But this is not an Iran-specic issue – notwithstanding the broader tensions in the region. This is about Syria and about a breach of the sanctions against Syria, which of course is a country that Iran is active in.”Tehran yesterday reiterated calls for the UK to release an Iranian-owned oil tanker that was seized by Royal Marines over suspicions it was violating EU sanctions by transporting a shipment of oil to Syria. But Abbas Mousavi, a spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, warned Britain was entering into a “dangerous game” that would have “consequences”. Mr Mousavisaid: “The documents and evidence and the contradictory remarks made by the British all indicate that London’s allegation, legally speaking, is not that signicant and noteworthy unless they would want to enter into a dangerous game under the influence of the Americans with no end in sight.”During Friday prayers, Kazem Sedighi, an adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatened retribution.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland should get its own distinct immigration rules under new pilot","story":"The Scottish Government has formally proposed #piloting# a distinct system of immigration north of the Border.Holyrood’s immigration minister Ben Macpherson has written to his UK counterpart ahead of a summit on the issue later this month amid growing concerns that Scotland will suffer under a post-Brexit crackdown.In the letter to the Minister of State for Immigration Caroline Nokes, Mr Macpherson said a tailored approach to immigration should be considered.He said: “A declaratory system, avoiding the need to make an application and removing the threat of refusal except in the most extreme circumstances would best protect the rights of EU citizens living here.”The call comes after the Migration Advisory Committeesaid a tailored migration policy for dferent parts of the UK should be taken forward.A four-nations roundtable meeting on migration will see the Holyrood minister and Ms Noakes joined by the Welsh Government’s Brexit minister Jeremy Miles and the head of Northern Ireland’s Civil Service David Sterling.“Given the signicance of the matter to Scotland, I would also like to discuss how we can work together to deliver the regional immigration pilot projects the MAC recommended in their most recent report, which was a welcome acknowledgement of the need for tailored migration policy for dferent parts of the country,” his letter states.Mr Macpherson has also renewed concerns over the proposed salary threshold of £, for EU workers, which he claimed would have a “catastrophic” effect on the economy of Scotland.

Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”.

You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery.

Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there.

Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless.

Lauren, who has two children aged  and , has just taken up a new position as cook in a Galgorm nursing home.A past pupil of Ballee High School, Lauren admits that it took her a while to realise what she wanted to do after leaving school.When she signed up for the Professional Cookery course at Northern Regional College, it was a case of third time lucky.Lauren said: “I did both Level  Childcare Diploma and then Level  Diploma in Business and Retail Administration at the College but they weren’t for me. “When I finished the second course, I got a temporary job working in a school kitchen and that was when I knew what I wanted to do.”She admits that the job as a cook really whetted her appetite for working in a kitchen and she hasn’t looked back.“I loved the Professional Cookery course and I’m already missing College! The emphasis was on practical skills rather than written work and this really suited me. I enjoyed every minute of it.”Lauren’s proud parents, Marbeth and Brian were there to see her collect her award.Marbeth said: “Lauren deserves great credit and we’re so pleased for her.“She struggled with her work at school and we now realise that this was as a result of her dyslexia. “All her hard work has paid off and we’re delighted for her.”Northern Regional College offers a range of Professional Cookery courses at its campuses in Ballymena and Ballymoney.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland.

Samples tested by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Instituteconfirmed traces of ASF DNA in sausages brought in from Asia.The British Veterinary Associationyesterday welcomed the quick response from Government vets and inspectors who discovered the meat and seized it.ASF is already ravaging through south-east Asia and in parts of Europe including Belgium, causing hundreds of thousands of pigs to be slaughtered. The biggest producer of pork meat in the world is China and it, too, is seeing herds wiped out in efforts to contain ASF.Northern Ireland has imposed strict controls prohibiting personal imports of meat and dairy products from most countries outside of the EU.BVA president Simon Doherty said: \"Its very encouraging to see that Government vets and inspectors are united in their vigilance to prevent the incursion of this deadly disease.\"We are fortunate in Northern Ireland to have a surveillance facility like AFBI that can carry out quick and effective testing and continuous monitoring for disease risks.\"African swine fever poses a signicant and growing threat to animal welfare and agriculture throughout all regions of the UK, so we need to continue to make every effort to curb its spread and raise public awareness of the risks of bringing animal products that may be carrying the disease into the country.\"Mr Doherty added: \"The seizure of kg of illegally imported products in June alone really underlines the scale of this important task ahead.\"While authorities say ASF poses no threat to human health, officials in Northern Ireland are concerned thatthe disease entered the region it could have devastating effects, damaging the local economy and putting local jobs at risk."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr O Cadhla was raised in the Ring Gaeltacht and previously represented the Cobh area on Cork County Council.After receiving summonses on charges of criminal damage in , Mr O Cadhla wrote to the clerk of Cork District Court asking that his trial be conducted in Irish. But when the matter came before Judge Olann Kelleher in November , the judge said he intended to conduct the hearing in English as he knew the applicant could speak English.At later hearings an interpreter was provided, but Mr O Cadhla complained the interpreter could not translate both for him and the judge simultaneously.The case was adjourned after Mr O Cadhla asked the High Court to consider the constitutionality of Judge Kellehers decision. Mr O Cadhla claimed he would be placed at a disadvantagehis evidence was heard by a judge \"through the prism of a translation\" rather than in its original form.He argued this amounted to unequal treatment and was in conflict with Article  of the Constitution. This article provides that Irish is the first official language and English the second.It also says that provision may be made by law for the exclusive use of either language for official purposes.Mr O Cadhlas action was opposed by the State, which argued that any disadvantage he alleged could be cured by the process of translation. However, the court heard from a number of solicitors that it was \"usual practice\" for a bilingual judge to be found where one was requested.Ms Justice Ni Raeartaigh said that, in a nutshell, the case concerned whether or not there was any right to be heard and understood in Irish by the district judge, as distinct from the right to speak and present ones case in Irish.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment. This is something I and many others are looking forward to..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new family walking trail opens at Saul  ","story":"A NEW walking trail for all the family to enjoy has been opened in Saul.The Saul Family Trail was officially opened last Wednesday by Newry Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Just under km in , the new route is at Saul GAC, which was behind the project.Club officials attended last weekrsquos launch and along with representatives of ious support organisations and members of the local community.Saul GAC is located at the foot of Slieve Patrick, a popular walking area for locals and tourists alike due to its beauty and historic interest.The current walking routes around the mountain are quite challenging and are not suitable for all levels of ability.The new trail is fully accessible to allow and encourage everyone to participate in outdoor activities.It offers Saul and Raholp a hub from which local people and visitors can enjoy the beauty of the local environment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

It’s was a great experience meeting Brian Cox as well, he was really interesting and good at making the topics exciting.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”Lord Maginnis went on: “He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland. “One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens. “I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”Lord Maginnis said that last year, some time after the compensation, Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.Addressing a largely empty House of Lords, the peer contrasted what he said had happened with the civil servant to the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland, who he said had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.He added: “This is scandalous.

They want their truth – truth on their terms.”He added: “If history portrays them for what they were – terrorists – then rewrite the history and reinvent the English language.”It was noted that the security forces have enjoyed no amnesty of the kind which has de facto been given to many terrorists, adding that “the Orange Institution unapologetically supports our security forces and we pay tribute to their service and sacrice”.He also made reference to a recent news story, covered by the News Letter, about Tyrone GAA players bursting into song on their bus while a loyalist parade took place outside the static vehicle.The song, Come Out You Black And Tans, glories the IRA, and the incident drew an apology from Tyrone GAA boss Mickey Harte.The singing “could have led to an incident of a serious nature”, said Rev Gibson, adding that it “demands a police investigation”.And on the subject of the recent Westminster developments on marriage and abortion, Rev Gibson said: “The world may have moved from God’s word on these matters, but the Orange Institution remains committed to the whole counsel of scripture – there can be no ambiguity.“October  will be a sad day for Northern Irelandthere is no Assembly in place it will show that both lives don’t matter, a child in the womb will become a mere medical procedure, God’s ordained purpose of marriage will be thwarted ... Sadly, some changes are inevitable, so it is important that we respond to such moral changes with compassion and grace.Leak of bonfire names is unlikely to have come from PSNI, says top officerIrish tricolour is hoisted above rural Orange lodge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We may not agree with these new changes, but our response must be that of Christ – love and compassionate action, not mere condemnation and criticism.”When it came to the parade itself in the west Tyrone village, around  lodges and a similar number of bands took part.A total of six districts with lodges representing Killen, Sixmilecross, Fintona, Newtownstewart, Omagh, and Strabane were on parade.This year also saw street performers incorporated into proceedings including Lambeg drums, highland dancers and much more.The main parade left the assembly field on the Longland Road at .pm and proceeded to the Berryhill Road where the demonstration field was located.Speaking with Rev Gibson was Brother Derek Reaney, assistant grand master, and the religious service was conducted by Co Tyrone Grand Chaplain, Brother Rev David Reid, assisted by Brother Rev Alan Irwin.William Scanlon, secretary of Bready LOL and Strabane district secretary, said: “Everything was %.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
