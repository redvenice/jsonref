At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ... Never click on a link in the email or attachment, and refuse any request for money or details. Scan any suspicious text or email for clues.

Switzerland and Germany have been ided by the coronavirus pandemic. Fences, concrete obstacles or barrier tapes separate them after the borders were closed to slow the spread of the virus. But love cannot be locked away“Look, we even marked the border on our blanket,” laughs Sabrina. And indeed just below the barrier tape a black line ides the cloth in half. Lying on one half is Sabrina, from Basel on the other, Davor from Wiesbaden. We are in Riehen, the rich suburban community of Basel.It is the first time that the two of them have seen each other since the border was closed a good six weeks ago. The Covid-19 pandemic caused Switzerland and its surrounding countries to close their borders mid-March. Only people who work in another country and companies transporting goods are now allowed to cross the borders at the few crossings that are still open.It is a warm spring day. Riehen is famous for its cherry trees, thanks to the mild climate of the Rhine plain. And on these cherry trees, which are in blossom on both sides, the border guards have attached barrier tapes which now mark what is accessible. These tapes also trace the border lines which were reinforced with barbed wire during the second world war.For the people on both sides, these restrictions are a serious disturbance, as the border has hardly been noticed in recent decades. Friendships exist across borders, as do families and lovers.“Take pictures of us,” says Sabrina. “It’s good if this becomes known.” An untenable situation for her. Davor arrived today to see his girlfriend. It takes three and a half hours to drive from Wiesbaden, and he will return in the evening.Despite everything, the mood is good on this friendly day. Along the barrier tape several groups of people have arranged to meet: separated families, friends, other lovers. A group of young men has set up camping chairs on both sides of the barrier. All three are from Lörrach in Germany, the neighbouring community of Riehen. One of them is studying in Basel. This is the only place they can meet and drink beer together.The border stretches up the hill. A bit further up the edge of the forest, I meet Diethard (on the German side) and his girlfriend Sibel (on the Swiss side). Sibel, also a German citizen, works in a clinic in Switzerland: “If I were to officially go over to Germany, I would first have to be in quarantine for two weeks. That’s impossible.”Now and then an army helicopter flies along the unclear border, making sure the rules are obeyed on the ground. There soldiers reinforce the border guards. If a couple gets too close to each other on the border, the guards usually turn a blind eye.This is not the case everywhere. Further east on Lake Constance are Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) and its sister city of Constance (Germany). They have grown together completely. In some places, the fence erected by the Swiss during the second world war to prevent Jewish refugees or German opposition members from crossing the border still exists.Since the border is shorter and clearer here than at Basel, it was easier to close it again in the wake of the pandemic.Shortly after the closing of the border, I meet Katarina from Frauenfeld, in Switzerland, and Ivo, a student from Konstanz. Three times a week they meet at the border, also to exchange tenderness they met in Croatia only last New Year.Here, physical closeness was a thorn in the side of the Swiss law enforcement officers: a week later, when I saw the two of them again, kissing was no longer possible. A second fence was raised two metres away from the first, under strong protest from the local population. Now Katarina and Ivo can only look into each other’s eyes.But they still have it good: along the Italian and French borders, such meetings were always out of the question, because in Italy and France – unlike in Switzerland and Germany – strict curfews prevented this.With the flattening of the corona curve, demands are now being made to open the borders again. Not only families and couples want their normal relationship back, but also the trades that usually do good business on the other side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b65c9de0703d788c1f220a6704d600e5be628b8/0_30_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=242820321209cfb2506c14dc87bb02a4","title":"buy a classic sport photograph euphoria at the 1966 world cup","story":"The latest of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images.

Translated from Yuin, the language of the country, it means “dancing grass”.Pascoe and his small team of coworkers have never done a harvest like this before. There’s so much grass that both sheds are full, and Pascoe says they are “racing against the clock to refine our methods so we can extract the seed and make the flour. We have got to get this done in two or three weeks before the seed completely drops.”The team had a ceremony for the the beginning of the harvest because they think it’s the first time in 200 years that mandadyan nalluk has been harvested for food.“And some of these people are descended from those who would have done the last harvest,” Pascoe says. “That’s what this farm is all about – trying to make sure that Aboriginal people are part of the resurgence in these grains, rather than being on the periphery and being dispossessed again.”They had intended to harvest a different, more promising crop of kangaroo grass but it was destroyed by the summer’s catastrophic bushfires. As a CFA volunteer, Pascoe spent weeks on the fire and recovery efforts. His sheds burned down but his house survived.As he battled the fires, Pascoe was under increasingly vitriolic attack over his 2014 book Dark Emu, which used historical sources, including the journals of explorers, to show that Aboriginal people engaged in complex agriculture and were not just hunter-gatherers.The personal attacks, largely driven by the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt and a prominent Aboriginal businesswoman, Josephine Cashman, escalated. Cashman asked the Australian federal police to investigate allegations that Pascoe had received financial benefit from claiming to be Aboriginal. The AFP said Pascoe’s Aboriginality “was not relevant in determining whether a commonwealth offence had been committed, as such there was no need to undertake these inquiries”. Then the provenance of a letter Bolt and Cashman relied on to denounce Pascoe was called into question by NITV. Cashman was removed from the senior advisory body to the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt.Pascoe had little to say publicly at the time and withdrew from some scheduled appearances. But he says book sales went up and he could afford to hire four young people to work with him.“When Andrew Bolt attacked me a lot of Australians took it as a personal attack on them, because a lot of people have read Dark Emu,” he says. “The same people, booksellers have been telling me, bought 10 copies as Christmas presents.But Pascoe says it was “the worst, worst time of my life”.“It was hard for me, that period,” he says. “I’m not trying to downplay it. I’m not trying to say I’m this resilient character because I’m not. But I was totally supported by Aboriginal community. Not every Aboriginal person, obviously, because people tell me that social media was rife with other opinions. But basically the elders stuck by me firm, and some of them came down here, some of them stopped me in the street, to tell me to keep doing what I was doing.”Pascoe says he took solace from the number of Australians “who want their children to learn a better history, a more true history”.“It’s a wave that is washing over these dinosaurs,” he says. “There’s an extinction event happening, and the dinosaur, of course, is never aware of his demise.”Pascoe’s team has been able to work right through the coronavirus: “We just carry on. This is a very isolated farm and we’re isolated on it, so it’s pretty good.”This week they milled some of the mandadyan nalluk seed into flour and baked a loaf of bread.“It’s beautiful bread. It’s a really dark, rye-like flour. Incredibly dark, incredibly aromatic, but also very tasty,” Pascoe says, and it’s not like anything he has smelled before.He gets seven or eight requests a day from bakers and restaurateurs to supply seed or flour, which they will do when they get the milling right.He also wants to show local farmers that letting these plants grow is worth the effort.“In future years it’ll be commonplace because we can grow these grasses on degraded land. I think there are a lot of farmers on marginal land now. They want some consistency, and they want reduced costs. Perennial grain is a way to do that.”The dancing grass is only one of several perennials the team is working with, including kangaroo grass, warrigal greens, samphires and water ribbons.“We cooked with murnong the other day in a recipe we hadn’t tried before and it was sensational,” Pascoe says. “Water ribbon tubers are absolutely delicious. We found a plant, we still don’t know what it is, which came back after the fires, a lovely little onion type thing, absolutely sensational.“There’s nothing new about it at all, but we ignored it. We turned our back on anything of Aboriginal provenance, such was our sensitivity to the history of the country.“It’s time to embrace the history of the country, and with that we will be able to embrace its food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86f4acf73acaba005ed042020c1525ece6421ebd/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3b0993321585e08f8d7a18a5eff759d","title":"the guardian view on the hybrid parliament unfinished business","story":"Digital scrutiny is imperfect but it has proved that the Commons can modernise. Ending the experiment prematurely is a backwards stepThere is still much to be learnt about the coronavirus, but it is clear that transmission is efficient in crowded, enclosed spaces. On that basis a full House of Commons is unsafe.That is why “hybrid scrutiny” was introduced, with most MPs contributing to debates remotely. It is an imperfect system but also a vital experiment in technological adaption by an institution that is slow to embrace modernity.So it is a shame that Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the house, wants to bring the experiment to a close at the end of this month. Mr Rees-Mogg’s view is that MPs should “lead by example”, encouraging people back to work by appearing in Westminster’s most famous workplace. Regulations that permit digital participation might not be extended. MPs would be corralled back into the chamber or forfeit the ability to perform their democratic duties.It is true, as Mr Rees-Mogg also asserts, that constituents expect their representatives to work, but more revealing that he thinks the only way they can do so is standing on the Commons stage. That is the aspect of the job he values. Other MPs want to know whether government guidance on the return to work is coherent and responsible when the virus is still prevalent. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, challenged Mr Rees-Mogg on that point on Wednesday.Parliament is more than the sum of its members. It employs many people in supporting roles. As in any workplace emerging from lockdown, there will be questions about childcare, vulnerability from underlying health problems, and the wisdom of using public transport. Government guidance encourages those who can work from home to do so and MPs have that facility.Hybrid scrutiny has serious flaws. The conference call is not great for challenging ministers. There is also an upside in the silencing of braying that obstructs reasonable debate and alienate audiences. It is too early to say what aspects of digitisation are successful, but it has worked well enough to prove that modernisation was overdue.That is one reason why Mr Rees-Mogg wants it suffocated. The leader of the house is the champion of the Conservative faction that venerates parliament as the symbolic pinnacle of British democracy, while abhorring any exercise of legislative power in opposition to their ideological demands. The hypocrisy was displayed constantly over Brexit, culminating in Mr Rees-Mogg’s connivance in a cynical prorogation that was then ruled unlawful by the supreme court.It is imperative that parliament exercise its powers at full capacity during this crisis, and hybrid scrutiny is problematic. But that is not why the experiment is in peril. If the government were serious about parliamentary sovereignty, MPs would be given a vote on extending or amending the regulations in light of what has been learned. Instead, the decision to switch off the digital parliament is in the hands of the executive, regardless of the Speaker’s reservations.The reason is not better scrutiny but public relations to serve the government – to symbolise normality returning, regardless of whether sufficient progress has been made against Covid-19. It is the prioritisation of theatre over policy and archaic ritual over reality. This is Mr Rees-Mogg’s creed. It is no way to run a modern democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46ec9f8e174a7136e850c6c88c408185b035c239/0_15_3134_1891/master/3134.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5318990f32a4155c00d3137372b36479","title":"why were obsessed with zoom backdrops from anna wintour to meryl streep","story":"The pandemic has forced us to make our private spaces into public ones. Here’s how to get it right It’s behind you! Look over your shoulder!No, it’s not panto season yet. It’s pandemic season (still). But the battle cry is the same. Time to stop fretting about when you can get your roots done and tidy your bookshelves because in the video-conferencing age, you win or lose according to your backdrop.With a Zoom parliament, a Houseparty social life and a Microsoft Teams meeting schedule, our lockdown lives are being played out against a backdrop of bookshelves and kitchen cupboards. The pandemic turns out to be a bit like living on the National Theatre set of a Harold Pinter play. Around now, we would usually be bombarded by red carpet images from Cannes instead, we’ve got Joe Wicks’s back garden and the stoutly furnished studies of MPs. A list of surprising lockdown winners – and unexpected losers – is emerging. Meryl Streep nailed a pitch-perfect performance in a virtual staging of Stephen Sondheim’s musical Company. In honour of the composer’s 90th birthday, Streep charmed everyone. It wasn’t just her earrings (vintage-looking, fabulous), her martini (the classy choice for heavy drinking, don’t @ me) and her bathrobe (bow down) but the bookshelves behind, bare save for a wooden duck of the generic seaside-gift-shop variety – less an objet, more an afterthought. No Oscars. No colour-coded books. So relatable. A quarantined audience fell in love with Streep all over again. Anna Wintour’s Zoom backdrop, by contrast, has not been as scrupulously curated as one would expect from one the most valuable personal brands in Manhattan. On the Vogue Instagram, the editor’s lockdown looks have been exacting, low-key chic: in her lush spring garden with an adorable dog, at her elegantly curated desk in tailored sweatpants. But hosting Vogue Conversations videos, or on Naomi Campbell’s YouTube channel, she is in sunglasses framed against a window with drawn curtains. Closed curtains and sunglasses in the middle of the day make for a shifty, motel-room-scene-in-a-heist-movie look, even in the Hamptons. It’s all wrong. What I want from Anna is a crystal vase of peonies, a Smythson notebook with a silk ribbon and a Diptyque candle.There is a good reason we are obsessed with backdrops. You have seen the faces – your colleagues, your favourite Pilates teacher, the Duchess of Cambridge – 1,000 times but you haven’t seen inside their homes. The pandemic has forced us to make our private spaces public. And what may have begun as a voyeuristic interest is morphing into something else as the potential “new normal” sees us spend much more time at home long term. Your house is no longer just your home. It’s your HQ. In the new world order, the bookcase and the gallery wall are king of the power Zoom. Both backdrops can bridge the gap between authentically homely and rigorously professional. If the ideal power backdrop was once the skyscraper skyline view from your glass-boxed top floor office, a wall of books or black-and-white photographs makes for a passable lockdown substitute – the same busy, masculine right angles, the same solidity. You don’t have an office filled with leather-bound reference tomes or a study lined with weighty hardback biographies? No problem – a sitting-room shelf of battered paperbacks will do, at a push. Messaging is about simplicity and clarity, as every politician knows (or so we used to assume).) A bookshelf backdrop is a visual reassurance – to your constituents, or your boss, or your tutor – that although you are at home you are working hard, not skiving.Assessing celebrity bookcases is a pandemic parlour game. The Twitter account Bookcase Credibility assesses backdrops with a pithiness to match Craig Revel Horwood on Strictly Come Dancing. On the Conservative politician Liam Fox: “The bold grab at credibility is somewhat undermined by the hardback copy of The Da Vinci Code.” Meanwhile, more visually oriented public figures recreate the same mood with a gallery wall, with lots of images of various sizes jigsawed together to create a pleasing but undistracting backdrop. One arresting arty image rarely works, especially if it’s a portrait – as Matt Hancock discovered, when a video shot in front of a Damien Hirst image of the Queen made him look as if he was photobombing a royal photocall. Just like live theatre – which, in a way, it is – the magic of the Zoom backdrop is in the potential for disaster. (Who can forget Prof Robert Kelly, upstaged by his daughter Marion?) There are shelves with a distracting number of books about Nazis. (I get that there’s nothing wrong with reading books about Nazis, it just looks odd to have them front and centre.) There is the rookie error of placing the laptop too low, framing your head in silhouette with an expanse of ceiling behind you. This gives the viewer the feeling that you are looming down threateningly on them, which is not great for a chat. There are pop stars who forget to make their beds before broadcasting to the world, as Charlie Puth did.Even fashion obsessives have taken to poring over decor, not dresses. When that Adele photo landed last week, my social media was full of comment – not about her weight loss, but the grey clapboard architecture and cutesy rose arbour, which one Twitter wit skewered as making her look like “a sorority treasurer about to marry into old money”. Marc Jacobs has, inevitably, the most fabulous Zoom look I’ve seen to date – red manicure popping against his yellow velvet sofa, wooden panelling oozing order and luxury.But the backdrop equivalent of the crisp white shirt is proving to be a serene, unadorned room with only a closed door and perhaps the edge of a framed picture in the background. A closed door makes you look like you are in serious, Do Not Disturb mode. Designers Marine Serre and Simone Rocha, on Zoom for the Vogue Conversations, each sat in a calm-looking room with a shut door behind. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Zoom from a grey room with a white closed door with a lovely arch above it, which makes them look slightly holy. Am I reading too much into a Zoom backdrop? Possibly. If so, I’m not the only one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d2023a9e804a3463a45b10f516230a26132e71/94_149_1098_659/master/1098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a56dcb58be23ba60dde19a419c22284","title":"david athertons recipe for smoky rice noodle salad","story":"This fresh, quick and easy recipe uses lapsang souchong tea to get smoke-flavoured noodlesSmoking has been used to preserve food since ancient times.

Used more like a condiment than a side dish in its homeland, a little spicy cabbage peps up no end of dishes – plus it’s surprisingly easy to make and keeps for months. Which might just come in useful.Prep 25 min, plus salting timeCook None, but allow at least 5 days to fermentMakes 1 x 1-litre jar180g coarse salt, plus 2 tsp extra1 large cabbage – preferably a Chinese one, but any will do300g daikon or other radish1 large carrot3 spring onions4 garlic cloves4cm root ginger, peeled40g salted shrimp (saeu-jeot), finely chopped (optional)50g Korean red chilli flakes (gochugaru)1 tsp sugar2 tbsp fish sauce (optional)There are hundreds of types of kimchi using different vegetables, seasonings and even fruits this is a simplified version made with ingredients that should be fairly easy to get hold of locally or online. If you’d prefer to keep it vegetarian, or can’t find either dried shrimp or fish sauce, leave them out. Equally, other chilli flakes will do, if need be, though they’ll have a different flavour.Put a litre and a half of water into a saucepan with the salt, and put over a medium heat. Heat, stirring, until the salt has dissolved, then pour into a cold bowl and leave to cool while you prepare the cabbage. Some say that you should use non-chlorinated water, which for most of us will mean mineral water, but tap water works for me.While the brine is cooling, wash the cabbage and chop it lengthways into quarters. Carefully cut out and discard the woody core from each quarter (or save for veg stock), then, working across rather than along the leaves, cut the quarters into thick slices about 4cm wide, though it doesn’t matter if they’re a little bigger or smaller.Put the cabbage slices in a large bowl and pour over the cooled water, tossing so all the leaves come into contact with the brine. Leave to sit at room temperature, turning occasionally, until the tough white stems have wilted, which will probably take two to three hours.Wash and cut the radish and carrot into bite-sized cubes (if using small radishes, this may just be a question of cutting them in half). Sprinkle with two teaspoons of salt, leave to sit for half an hour, then drain. Wash and roughly chop the spring onion, using all but the toughest bit of the green part.Crush or finely chop the garlic, ginger and salted shrimp, if using (if not, you may wish to add a quarter-teaspoon of fine salt to make up for them). Put these in a bowl with the chilli flakes, sugar and fish sauce, if using, mix well and loosen with 150ml cold water.Rinse the cabbage very well under cold water, washing in between the leaves to get rid of any salt still clinging on, then drain thoroughly. Shake the leaves dry in a clean tea towel, then tip back into the large bowl. Pour in the seasoning and toss to coat – gloves are advisable if you use your hands.Spoon the kimchi into a clean jar, crock or pot, pressing it in very firmly to minimise the amount of air trapped between the leaves. As much of the cabbage as possible should be submerged in the liquid it emits, so you need to weight it down – a clean plastic bag full of cold water should do the trick – then seal the jar.Put the jar in a cool place out of direct sunlight for five days, checking on it and pushing it back down under the liquid as necessary (it will give off more as it sits), then taste it should be mildly tangy by this point. Once it’s sour enough for your taste, refrigerate it to pause the fermentation process, and consume at your leisure – it will keep for months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7ce6baca54eb4c6d0dc3e2efcba43b26534325/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c3111a939af92d7d8f79f49f6d7189ec","title":"jamal khashoggis fiancee urges newcastle fans to oppose takeover","story":"Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, has implored Newcastle United supporters to mobilise against the prospective Saudi Arabia-funded takeover of the club.Although the vexed issue of the kingdom’s human rights record is beyond the parameters of the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test, the governing body is examining allegations of broadcast piracy against Saudi Arabia. Newcastle’s prospective Saudi majority owners have denied any link to the BeoutQ piracy.Cengiz, whose fiancé was killed inside Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Istanbul in 2018, believes that remit should be extended to the country’s human rights abuses, already highlighted by Amnesty International. Newcastle fans have no direct power to veto the buyout but she hopes they will demand the Premier League block a deal many regard as a blatant attempt to “sportswash” Saudi’s international image.“I write to you at a crucial time in the history of your famous club,” wrote Cengiz in an open letter to Newcastle fans. “Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the absolute ruler of Saudi Arabia, is aiming to take over your club by offering a huge sum of money.“You as the loyal fans do have a big say in this. I implore you all to unite to protect your beloved club and city. They are making this move not with your best interests in mind, but solely to serve themselves. Their hearts will not genuinely be in the club that means everything to you. Now is the moment to stand tall together for the game, your club, your city and your country in order to slam shut the door on this offensive deal.”Saudi Arabia has described Khashoggi’s murder as a rogue operation of which the heir to the throne knew nothing. An investigation by Agnès Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, found that Saudi Arabia was responsible under human rights law for the murder and that it was “inconceivable” the operation that resulted in his death could not have been implemented without Bin Salman being aware a criminal mission was being launched against the journalist.Despite the late emergence of new documents related to alleged broadcast piracy, sources close to the takeover remain optimistic an agreement broadly welcomed by Newcastle fans will be approved in the near future. They maintain “no red flags” have been raised and that the delay has been partly prompted by the Premier League’s necessary preoccupation with Project Restart.Meanwhile Ashley, who has received a £17m non-refundable deposit, is understood to be eager to see the balance paid in order to help address coronavirus-induced cashflow problems in his high street retail empire.The Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has revealed Steve Bruce’s players remain in the dark about the takeover. “We’re the same as the fans,” said Shelvey. “We don’t know what’s going on.” Although Shelvey said Ashley had “always been good to me”, the former England international would welcome a buyout. “I think it would be good for the fans, the club and the city.”It is understood Newcastle have removed some employees from the government’s furlough scheme as active staffing levels rise ahead of the squad’s return to training next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abacdc8df328a093c68115ab8a26c1502ae5d72a/0_168_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc3bbe617b190e54d3cf31568bf73b79","title":"lincolns ben coker with diabetes i have to think about the restart more than others","story":"The defender, possibly the only diabetic professional in England, is putting family and wellbeing before thoughts of resuming playingCoker was told at the age of 15 he had type 1 diabetes, the condition where the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin, although it has not stopped him from enjoying a long career in the sport he loves. Now 30, he is best known for his six seasons at Southend during which he made 208 appearances in all competitions.Coker believes football should not be coming back any time soon and does not pull his punches on the subject. But he does not say so because of his diabetes, rather the fact he is about to become a father for the first time, and how he is – more than anything – worried about his family. For him, it comes down to basic humanity.“From a fan’s point of view, everyone wants to watch football because there’s nothing else going on, but you have to look at us as human beings and say it’s not fair or right for us to be put in that situation where we’re going to be vulnerable to catching the virus,” Coker says.“All it’s going to take is for someone to go down with it really badly and then, by the way, the legal side of it would be chaos. People do look at us sometimes as not being human beings but everyone has to be in the same boat.Coker knows the reality of the situation in Leagues One and Two. For largely financial reasons it is expected the competitions will be cancelled. Most clubs at this level cannot bear the cost of games without fans – action behind closed doors is a government stipulation – and nor will they be able to afford to test their players and staff with the requisite regularity.But, Coker says, even the Premier League ought to rethink its mid-June comeback target. “I think it’s too soon,” Coker says. “There is so much money coming into the game now and money rules the world in a certain way. It shouldn’t be like that but it is. So I wouldn’t be surprised if the Prem starts up again but for players at my level I can’t see it. To play behind closed doors is not beneficial to any League One and Two clubs.“Also, if someone comes down with the virus, they’re going to have to isolate. There are so many things to think about and I’ve come to the conclusion it’s not going to happen. If they cancel now, it will give us all a better chance of starting the next season at a normal time.”A consensus among players over a restart is difficult to find but does Coker feel his view is shared by his peers? “I speak to my teammates and to be fair everyone is gagging to go back to football,” he says. “I miss the routine of day-to-day life, everyone does, but everyone also wants to be safe and well with their families. That comes into it massively.“If I was a single lad living on my own I’d probably have a different opinion but you have to look at the bigger picture. We want it to be as short a period as possible before we get back to it but we have to do it in as safe a way as possible.”Coker speaks with a heavy heart. In October 2018, playing for Southend at Sunderland, he sustained a season-ending knee injury. “I did a bit of everything – my cruciate, my LCL and the meniscus,” he says. And, soon after his move to Lincoln last summer, he tore his groin and needed a further operation. He has managed only one appearance this season – for Lincoln in November.In short, he is desperate to play again. But other things are more important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beaffd759adfea3f1bac21057011760947490161/0_183_5107_3064/master/5107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b43e31af1d48d49a9c0fabe110a78349","title":"adrian chiles west brom coronavirus phone calls","story":"I have joined my club, West Brom, in calling up our older season ticket holders to see how they are getting on. It is a fascinating and moving experienceIf you haven’t already, please do familiarise yourself with the story of a 65-year-old West Bromwich Albion fan called Peter George. All his family’s efforts to bring him around from a coma had failed until they played him a compilation of music associated with our football club. Incredibly, he responded. The club’s charitable foundation then got some of his favourite players to record messages for him, and something approximating a miracle came to pass. He is back at home now.This is only a small part of what the club has been up to. A month ago, I got a text from a fellow supporter in Sutton Coldfield. “Just had a call from the Albion to see if Neville and I are OK!” It turned out that the Albion Foundation, West Brom’s charitable arm, were calling all of the club’s season ticket holders over the age of 70. Amanda’s husband is in his 70s, and she answered the phone. As she put it: “Not sure what they’d have offered to do if I’d said we weren’t OK, but it’s the thought that counts.”How true. Everyone I have spoken to who is been making these calls said it was a fascinating and moving experience. All human life, it turns out, is right there at the end of a phone line.I asked if I could help and was a sent a list of names and numbers. I was slightly cringing at the Surprise Surprise element of this. You know, the yes-it’s-me-off-the-telly thing. I needn’t have worried. Keen not to identify myself fully, nearly every conversation started the same way.“Hello, there. It’s Adrian from the Albion here, just ringing round to see how our more senior fans are doing.”“Hello Mr Chiles,” they would say, neither surprised nor pleased or displeased that it was me on the phone.But everyone wants to talk.Who knew you could get such a detailed snapshot of lives lived by asking just two questions: how are you managing in the lockdown? And how long have you been supporting the Albion? Everyone I have spoken to seems to be doing OK. If their families aren’t close by, then neighbours are doing their bit. One old chap I spoke to chuckled as he said: “I’ve got a young lady down the road who sorts me out good.”“Good for you.” I said.“Not like that!” he clarified.As for the supporters’ tales, there is no more economical way of getting at a life story.“First went in ’51. Our mum took me because Dad was always working.”“I lived next to the ground but never went once until I was 66. My grandson wanted to go. I love spending time with him.”“My dad was a Villa fan he never forgave me.”With the 75th anniversary of VE Day fresh in my mind, I noticed that all the people on my list were born during or not long after the second world war. I mentioned this to a man called Eric.“No good asking me about that,” he said. “I was only two.” Enough said. Straight-talking people, are Black Country folk.Rob Lake, who runs the Albion Foundation, said the point was to commit to ringing everybody, and not just have the odd player making a call and posting it on social media. Current and former players have chipped in, though, to great effect. Word having gone around about this, the foundation’s Lucy Moore, a young woman who has made hundreds of the calls, has detected some disappointment in their voices when they hear it’s only her on the line, not a player, bless her. But she has pressed on and heard it all: countless potted histories, some tales of struggle – in which case she has sought help – and, horrifyingly, bereavements, too. She spoke at length to a widow who went to every home game with the husband she had just lost.“I didn’t know what to say at first,” said Lucy. “But she was just happy to be talking to someone from the club.”I asked Lucy if there was one thing she had learned from the hundreds of conversations she’d had. “The incredible power of a phone call,” she said in wonder. “Just one call can do so much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904504e800191bc3a1cb48573f024b7ebff6f6e6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33cd1ccdb9a6e471a9ed307ddd9c1e91","title":"karen meme what does it mean","story":"As the meme has become more prominent online, its meaning has become confused – with real-life Karens caught in the crosshairsIt is the eye-rolling retort that Karens everywhere have come to know all too well: “OK, KAREN.”Yes, it is their given name – but on the internet, “Karen” has come to stand for so much more.According to a popular meme, Karen is a middle-aged white woman with an asymmetrical bob asking to speak to the manager, who happens to be as entitled as she is ignorant.But as the meme has become more prominent in online discourse, its meaning has become confused, and criticism has been voiced that it is sexist – with real-life Karens caught in the crosshairs.“I spend a lot of time on Twitter, so I find it rather annoying,” says Karen Geier, a writer and podcaster from Toronto. “Anything you say, people can be like, ‘OK, well, whatever, KAREN’ – but that’s not even how the meme is supposed to be used. It’s supposed to be about people who want to speak to the manager.”Know Your Meme, a Wiki-style site that defines internet culture, added “Karen” last year as an extension of the “‘Can I speak to the manager’ haircut” meme, born of Black Twitter back in 2014. “Whenever you want to signal that that character’s a Karen, you’ll just toss that haircut on,” says the editor-in-chief, Don Caldwell.The choice of moniker has been linked to the 2004 film Mean Girls, where a character says, outraged: “Oh my God, Karen, you can’t just ask someone why they’re white” – a meme in and of itself.But more likely, the name was chosen for its association with whiteness. “Growing up as a kid in the 1990s, I remember people – particularly other black kids – being like, ‘You don’t look like a Karen,’” recalls Karen Attiah, an editor at the Washington Post. “It was an unspoken thing, but Karen was a white, older lady’s name.”When Attiah was born in 1986, “Karen” was already in decline, having peaked in the US in 1965. In 2018 there were just 468 baby Karens born. “We’re kind of a rare breed,” she says.Her mother, who had immigrated from Nigeria, chose the name so that Attiah could “easily move around in a white-dominated world”. “It has afforded me, I think, a certain privilege,” says Attiah.It is that privilege that the meme sets out to skewer. In 2018, it was among a handful of female names to become attached to a spate of viral videos showing white women racially targeting people of colour. The antagonist of one such clip, of a woman calling the police over a group of African American men having a barbecue in a park in Oakland, California, came to be known as BBQ Becky (another name applied to white women online).The meme is therefore rooted in black American internet culture, says Attiah – an attempt to find humour in real-world racism and oppression. To call someone a Karen is to target a particular behaviour: “It’s a very specific definition and, if you’re not acting that way, it shouldn’t bother you,” says Attiah. To try to hijack the meaning of the meme is “a pretty Karen thing to do”.The meme has new resonance in the time of coronavirus, increasingly being applied to those who are protesting against social distancing measures or treating the pandemic as permission to unfairly police others.The male equivalent might be the “Kyle” meme: an angry, aggressive white teenage boy, characterised by his penchant for Monster energy drinks, Axe body spray and punching drywall. “Karen might be Kyle’s mom,” suggests Caldwell, “and they don’t have a very good relationship.”Last month, the British feminist commentator Julie Bindel tweeted that “the ‘Karen’ slur is woman hating and based on class prejudice”, arguing that it was a working-class name.She later said that she was not aware of the origins of the meme, and had reached her view after seeing “white misogynistic men use it towards older women”. (At time of writing Bindel had deleted her Twitter account.)Advocate Alicia Sanchez Gill was among those to push back (as did Attiah, in a recent opinion article). She says now that it is possible that men have wielded the meme against women online – but it is still more typically used “by black women and working-class women to talk about the way wealthy, and often white women enact classism and racism”.As for suggestion that “Karen” is now a slur, says Sanchez Gill, the measure must be of material harm. “Being named Karen, as far as we know, has never blocked a person from getting a job the way some ‘ethnic-sounding’ and ‘black-sounding’ names have.”Bindel’s comparison of the “Karen” meme with how “Sharon” and “Tracy” – names of characters in the sitcom Birds of a Feather – were used to dismiss younger, working-class women in 1980s Britain suggests the meme might be being interpreted differently either side of the Atlantic.Karen Rhodes of Suffolk, England, says that 15 years ago the stereotype of a Karen was of someone who was “a bit irritating, with big boobs”. She had only recently learned of the meme, and saw it as just a bit of fun: “I’m sure there are people out there that will take offence, but it doesn’t bother me.”She was, however, horrified to recognise the “Can I speak to the manager” haircut as the exact same one she used to have: “I’m not having that again.”It is the meme’s connotations “of expectation, of self-importance, of racism” that irk Geier – a self-described “gobshite leftist” – about her name being used against her online. “I don’t talk to cops. I definitely wouldn’t be calling them on someone running a lemonade stand.”Like Attiah, she distinguishes between being called Karen herself, and being a Karen: “Punching down IS the definitive Karen behaviour.”For one Karen, it has proved a learning opportunity.Karen Sandler, an attorney and software freedom advocate, says at first she was “a little sad” to see her name being applied so negatively – “but it’s just so funny, and also clearly, a little bit true”.It has in some ways been a wake-up call, says Sandler. “I never want to be ‘a Karen’ in the way the meme suggests and, since it’s my name, I think about this often. It has helped me really appreciate the advantages that I have in life, and emboldened me to speak out when I see people being ignored or disadvantaged.”The Karen character serves as a reminder to support people who are being ignored or overlooked, says Sandler, and to use her Karen powers for good. She included it in a recent talk she gave as an example of how everyone – not just Karens – can learn to be more mindful of others.“The only way we’ll help our societies to become fully equal is if we each are willing to speak out for other people who have more to lose by speaking up. And Karens are known for their voices!”For the best-selling Christian novelist Karen Kingsbury, the meme came as a little welcome light relief. “Honestly, I hadn’t seen the ‘Karen’ meme until your email,” she replied. “I must say when I looked at it, I smiled and laughed. Out loud. Which is always a fun thing.”No, she wasn’t offended, Kingbsury wrote: “I don’t mind the meme. It’s not me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d83d2a282dffbcb274261b598adc3e988e764fa3/465_376_1947_1169/master/1947.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=833b303c2f2eff1d4080b96adbc70294","title":"kate bush where to start in her back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the singer who was first underestimated, then finally revered as a visionaryWhen Big Boi from Outkast said that The Dreaming, the worst performing of Kate Bush’s 10 studio albums, was “a good place to start” in her catalogue, he was not wrong. Her previous three releases had established the high-octane prog-pop and catsuited hand-wafting image that still lingers today. But, though it seems ludicrous considering her legendary status now, Bush still wasn’t widely acclaimed by then. Most of the men writing about her would describe her looks or her tits, or ask her band whether she ever loses her temper with them, before acknowledging her songwriting craft. Even despite achieving a UK No 1 with Wuthering Heights at 19, her role as the architect of her own musical universe went largely unrecognised.Faced with such idiocy, it’s little wonder that Bush secreted herself away and came up with something as deranged as The Dreaming. This isn’t the album that took her stratospheric (that was its follow-up, Hounds of Love) but it’s her Willy Wonka-sized adventure in sound the self-sufficient cocoon that turned her, some say, from musician into “artiste”. The Dreaming was the first record that she produced entirely herself, which she would continue to do, using an expensive Fairlight sampler to dazzling effect. Listening to it now, it sounds like Bush unbound, unleashing her frustration like never before.These are brilliant rackets where her ingenious use of sampling (smashed marbles! Twittering birds!) defies expectation and her voice pole-vaults to new heights. The intricacy is overwhelming and thrilling. Opening track Sat in Your Lap is one of her best ever, foreshadowing Running Up That Hill with its gated drum gallop, as she screeches how people think that a knob equals knowledge, the rhythm pushing and pulling with kinetic energy. Every song after comes like a shock: the Artful Dodger oompah-pah of There Goes a Tenner, the guttural howling of “I am aliiiiive!” on the onyx slink of Pull Out the Pin to rival any hair-metaller’s, a title track about aborigines having their homeland stolen that unfortunately has Rolf Harris on didgeridoo, a chorus of donkeys on the closing song …In the end, Bush had the last laugh after all that donkeying around. Her No 1 album Hounds of Love, with its smash singles including Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God), which she self-produced yet again, was the payoff. Its success was so great that Bush’s first compilation album swiftly followed, gathering up her previous 11 singles into one all-killer, no-filler package. In the context of this article, you might call it cheating, or sacrilege, but in one fell swoop you get Bush careening gracefully from her romantic phase to her Balearic pop one, from her 1978 albums The Kick Inside and Lionheart through to the 80s. Ever the perfectionist, Bush is constantly rearranging her catalogue, her oeuvre ever-evolving like a living, breathing organism, and here there is Wuthering Heights with a newly recorded vocal, as well as a new song, Experiment IV, whose scary sci-fi video Bush directed (and which was subsequently banned by Top of the Pops). You will absolutely need to go back to listen to her first three albums in order afterwards – but this is a taster. Like I said, cheating.This was a softer Bush, totally feeling herself. She turned 30 during the making of this Ulysses-inspired album and there’s a sense that she’s finally revelling in her womanhood after years of being under constant scrutiny. She has said that she wanted to “express myself as a woman rather than as a woman wanting to sound as powerful as a man”. Of course, her simmering feminine energy is forcible, bolstered by the ululating voices of Trio Bulgarka. Their Bulgarian influence mingles with Celtic folk – a Bush staple – and far-flung instruments to create an otherworldly, Cocteau Twins-ish combination. And yet it is down-to-earth: This Woman’s Work, written for a John Hughes film, is one of Bush’s most-streamed songs, possibly because of its naked emotion, the fear of loss in her lyrics more universal than her usual storytelling theatrics Deeper Understanding is about finding solace in computers.After 1993’s The Red Shoes (much Prince a fun calypso tune about fruit), Bush took a leave of absence from the limelight to focus on bringing up her son. Rumours abounded: had she lost it? Was she tired of fame? When she returned, this double album said all she needed to say: it evoked the family idyll she’d been luxuriating in. On this album she is mother and domestic goddess, making a song about loading the washing machine sound whimsical on Mrs Bartolozzi and nodding to fanciful preoccupations with Elvis and mathematical constants. The second side, a song cycle called An Endless Sky of Honey, though, is something else entirely: a startlingly warm, amber-hued mini Disney movie of flamenco, Balearic folk, lambent new age, painterly piano, birdsong and skits with son Bertie (previously recorded by Rolf Harris, now removed), which she performed in full at her London live shows in 2014.Yes, that Rocket Man. Bush once said that “there’s always room for humour in music” and it’s a shame that musicians tend to take themselves so seriously. She memorably put her love of larks to great use in this reggae cover of her mate Elton’s track. You can find it on the rarities collection, The Other Sides, which came out in 2019 (also featuring Candle in the Wind and her take on Marvin Gaye’s Sexual Healing), or watch it via the long-lost video that she directed for it in 1991, where she jauntily plays a ukulele and conducts the moon rising as band member Davy Spillane emotively plays the Irish bagpipes. While you’re there, do play the video for her nourishing duet with Peter Gabriel, Don’t Give Up, too – and, if you can, hug your loved ones tight.Kate Bush: Under the Ivy, by Graeme Thomson (2010)It says something of Bush’s stealth that the first in-depth study of her art was published only 10 years ago. Journalist Graeme Thomson interviewed more than 70 collaborators and friends to create this thorough analysis of her work.How To Be Invisible by Kate Bush (2019)Bush in her own words, so to speak: her lyrics.Kate Bush: On Tour (1979)There are scant docs about Bush available on kosher platforms, so, while you wait for the BBC one to be released once more, try this 1979 version following Bush as she puts on her first and only live tour. As she fielded sexist questions from the presenter about whether she’d give it all up for motherhood, it’s amazing she kept her cool.

How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? … Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise.We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in …The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution … Finally, the country is long overdue for a real digital infrastructure … If we are to build a future economy and education system based on tele-everything, we need a fully connected population and ultrafast infrastructure. The government must make a massive investment – perhaps as part of a stimulus package – to convert the nation’s digital infrastructure to cloud-based platforms and link them with a 5G network.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db63a27e18b68de4265ba3c1c77c081a8696c1e2/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56a9ab48d7c7482b36eac54c3391230d 480w","title":"italian doctors find link between covid 19 and inflammatory disorder","story":"The disorder has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units.The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.On Tuesday, medics at the Evelina London Children’s Hospital announced the death of a 14-year-old boy, the first known fatality from the condition in Britain. Between 75 and 100 children are now receiving treatment across the country. Typical symptoms include a fever, skin rashes, red eyes, cracked lips and abdominal pain.Doctors suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction in the children, but there was no proof that the two were linked.The latest evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the city with the highest rate of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy. Medical records at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital showed that since the outbreak reached Bergamo, cases of Kawasaki-like disease rose to about 10 per month compared with one every three months in the previous five years.Of 10 children treated for the disorder between mid-February and mid-April, eight tested positive for antibodies to the virus. The two negative cases may be explained by faulty test results, the doctors believe.“Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between Sars-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,” said Dr Lorenzo D’Antiga, director of child health at the hospital. “I have no doubt that Kawasaki disease in these patients is caused by Sars-CoV-2.”Writing in the Lancet, the medics warn that the “strong association” between the virus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account when governments ease their lockdown restrictions. They stress, however, that the disorder is very rare, affecting no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. A fraction of these require intensive care.Dr Annalisa Gervasoni, a paediatric specialist at the hospital, said: “In our experience, only a very small proportion of children infected with Sars-CoV-2 develop symptoms of Kawasaki disease. However, it is important to understand the consequences of the virus in children, particularly as countries around the world grapple with plans to start relaxing social distancing policies.”Kawasaki disease, which overwhelmingly affects infants, causes inflammation of the blood vessels and in some cases a swelling of the heart. Swift treatment can prevent potentially lethal coronary aneurysms. The cause is not known, but studies suggest it is a post-infection inflammatory response that turns against the body.The rise in cases points to a form of Kawasaki disease that affects young schoolchildren more than infants and is triggered specifically by coronavirus. Since the first cases were reported in Britain, dozens more have emerged in the US, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland.Health officials in Britain launched a surveillance study this week to monitor cases of the disorder, which they have tentatively named PIMS-TS, for Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with Sars-CoV-2.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of paediatrics and child health, said it remained the case that children were largely unaffected by Covid-19, but that surveillance for the new syndrome would shed light on who it affects, how, and what the longer-term outcomes are. “The great majority of children with this condition have been well treated and are getting better and have gone home,” he said.Dr Liz Whittaker, a clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, said cases followed the curve of the coronavirus outbreak and appeared to have peaked, though she could not rule out more as restrictions are lifted. “We are not seeing many children who are really unwell with this condition,” she said. “It shouldn’t be a factor when we reopen the schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76b7e129bea5046f787dbe565097e8ddab34090/0_849_1377_826/master/1377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71a611c87015e788a97c1783ea0d3ee","title":"golf tennis players return to action after coronavirus lockdown","story":"Of all the thousands of golfers and tennis players who were reacquainted with the reassuring swoosh and snap of club and racket on ball on Wednesday, few surely heard a sweeter sound than the 18-handicapper Ed Sandison.When the 34-year-old stepped on to the 176-yard first hole at the Styal Golf Club in Cheshire at 9.04am, he was merely happy to be back after eight weeks of lockdown, happier still when he made good contact with his ball, and stunned to the point of disbelief when he realised he had made his first ever hole-in-one.“At first I couldn’t find my ball anywhere so I was getting a little annoyed – until I checked the cup,” he told the . “I spent the next 17 holes laughing with my father-in-law Tony. But everyone I saw seemed to be in such a good mood – and no wonder with golf being back.”However, physical distancing rules meant that Sandison, who runs an environmentally friendly golf company Ocean Tee using sustainable materials, had to celebrate a bit differently than tradition dictates. “Usually I would be buying everyone a drink at the 19th hole. But as I’ve been living with my in-laws for the past eight weeks I bought them a couple of bottles of champagne and a nice takeaway instead.”Sandison’s boundless joy at golf’s resumption was reflected on courses across England and Wales, with many reporting tee times being quickly booked out. Chris Winters, the captain of Northamptonshire County Golf Club, said there was a “widespread sense of relief and enjoyment” in the club – with players quickly adapting to the government’s new guidelines for sport.“The only place where two metres apart even felt like an issue was on tee boxes and greens,” he said. “We used the putter length as ‘gimme’ range for putts. The holes have been packed so the ball will only drop an inch into one and can be easily fetched out.”Jeremy Tomlinson, the chief executive of England Golf, said many of the 1,800 courses in the country had reopened on Wednesday and praised staff for their “Herculean efforts in trying to keep clubs afloat” during the lockdown.However, he also warned: “The financial issues raised by temporary business closure during the pandemic means that there are tough times ahead for all clubs. We are not out of the woods on this one. The threat from Covid-19 is also still very real.”Meanwhile the Wimbledon club, opposite the All England Lawn Tennis Club where the Wimbledon championships are played, also reported that courts were full of people gently scraping the rust from their forehands and backhands.“Every single outdoor court is booked from 8am to 8pm for the next week,” said one player, Susie Reid. “It’s extraordinary, but to be expected. People are sensible and have been good with the rules around here, and there is a high percentage of people who either work from home or are retired, who have been desperate to get back, knowing tennis and golf is low risk.“Online booking helps a lot. It’s lovely to say ‘hi’ to people we haven’t seen, and feel part of our tennis community again, albeit without a coffee catch-up.”Reid insisted that physical distancing rules had been easy to observe with players leaving their courts five minutes before the next pairing were due to arrive. “The tennis was better than we expected, even in the wind, although the footwork was pretty off to say the least,” she said. “The whole thing just felt joyous, and right. It’s time. It’s also nice to see the coaches back, giving lessons and earning some money.“It’s tough to see the club houses shut and bar and cafe areas closed but we’ll get there. People really value their clubs – it’s a way of life for so many.”The LTA, tennis’s national governing body, said there had been a three-fold increase in the number of courts booked via its online portal Clubspark compared to the same day last year.Meanwhile Gary Walker, the head coach at Grafton Tennis and Squash Club, said coaches were delighted to be back working – even if it was just for two to three hours a day for the moment. “Most of the coaches were doing five, six, seven hours every day until the lockdown,” he said. “Suddenly, they’re doing less. But it’s less rather than none at all.”Walker also accepted that it would take a little while yet for the social life to return, too. “There’s usually something going on here every week – a pub quiz, a little tennis tournament or something like that, so the social distancing is a bit eerie. You can’t go to the bar and have a beer or anything like that. You can’t even use the toilet facilities. But I think when push comes to shove, basically you’ve got to say: ‘At least you’re playing tennis.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc2c1b09ac6517b7bfeb9cc0ff720378b05be65/0_270_4589_2755/master/4589.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3abe960f725fd57a977f9147edea0623","title":"royal ascot set for go ahead behind closed doors in traditional june slot horse racing","story":"Royal Ascot is odds-on to be the first major British sporting event to take place behind closed doors this summer after the British Horseracing Authority confirmed its intended timetable for a series of major races, including the first four Classics of the season.It will be a Royal meeting like no other if the five-day event opens as scheduled on 16 June, with no Royal procession, morning suits or millinery and without the Queen in attendance for the first time in her 68-year reign. However, with eight of the Flat season’s Group One races – the most valuable and prestigious contests in the sport – due to be run at the meeting, staging Royal Ascot in its traditional slot in the calendar would be a major boost to an industry that has been idle since the lockdown began in mid-March.Several of the season’s most valuable and competitive handicaps are also run at the Royal meeting, including the Royal Hunt Cup and the Wokingham Handicap, adding to its appeal to the betting public at a time when most major sports could still be idle. In a normal year, the meeting would be expected to generate between £1m and £2m in revenue for racing from the betting Levy, which returns money to the sport from off-course betting.In the latest provisional schedule for the resumption of top-class racing, the 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas would be run on 6 and 7 June respectively – within a week of the anticipated return to action, subject to government approval, on 1 June.As a result, runners in both Classics would line up without a prep run, but several trials for the Derby and Oaks have been included in the provisional programme, including the Lingfield Oaks and Derby Trials on 4 and 5 June. The Epsom Classics are now scheduled for 4 July, following a meeting on Tuesday evening that approved plans to create an exclusion zone around the racecourse to keep spectators away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f8f6882a53f13efe4d8d0fd08253f21bbd7c5b/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=33219e045e5d39ae1c76fc545fe5ac19","title":"inaction film companies await clear guidance before rolling cameras","story":"While production has already restarted in Iceland and Sweden, British filmmakers fear UK is ‘behind the curve’Life on a film set is hard enough, with personality clashes, squeezed budgets and last-minute script changes, but now Covid-19 has forced the industry to confront a far bigger existential problem: can the show really still go on?This week the government gave the green light for filming to start again as long as production companies comply with physical-distancing guidelines, promising to work closely with the screen sector in order to “give confidence” that they can return to sets safely.But British film and TV producers are concerned that the UK is “behind the curve” on developing guidance that combats the risk of Covid-19 on sets, with some predicting that filming on British-based dramas will not start until September or October at the earliest.Production teams are awaiting new industry-wide guidance on how to work safely on sets from the British Film Commission (BFC), the national agency that has undertaken a consultation process asking figures from across the industry to give their feedback on new safe-working standards.Andrew Eaton, who produced the first two seasons of The Crown and the Formula One film drama Rush, said countries such as Iceland and Sweden, where filming has already restarted, have been better at providing film and TV production teams with clear standards.“It is real finger-in-the-air stuff at the moment,” said Eaton. “No one really knows until we start doing this what the practicalities are. The BFC is slightly behind the curve, we’ve already had guidelines from the Nordic countries, and from some studios in America.”Eaton said September or October was being discussed privately as a realistic return date for productions, but that when they eventually do restart it will be in a dramatically different landscape. “If you’re working with an older actor, they might say, ‘I’m not happy to do intimate scenes,’” said Eaton. “ There are going to be moral issues about whether or not we are putting people at risk.”Adrian Wootton, the BFC chief executive, said once the consultation is concluded on Friday the new procedures will be considered by Public Health England and if signed off they could work as a “roadmap” for studios and filmmakers. “We really have to get this done and get government supporting it before we flag up a false dawn by saying everyone is ready to go when they’re not,” he said.“This is not a cosmetic exercise. We’re not saying, ‘Here’s a guidebook, you can carry on as you did before,’ because no one believes that is possible. It’s only going to be possible if there are adaptations,” he added.Those moral questions are butting up against the economic reality for an industry where the majority of the workforce is freelance, and many do not qualify for government support schemes.“There’s £1bn worth of mothballed production in the UK,” said Wootton. “What we want is to help start that up again because then thousands of people can get their jobs back and we can start generating really big amounts of revenue for the UK. We want to do that, but do it safely.”Netflix, which has stopped all UK production, has started filming again in other countries, putting in place ad-hoc measures depending on location. In South Korea, where Netflix is filming two dramas, cast and crews regularly have their temperatures taken, and if anyone shows signs of infection, production is paused. In Iceland, where testing is more widely available, the whole cast and crew of the Scandi thriller Katla agreed to be tested before filming started.The lack of testing availability in the UK is a key concern for producers, Eaton said. “If you’ve got the ability to test and continue monitoring people, it’s much easier to feel that people are safe and to control it.“A lot of people I know are researching online how can we get access to test kits, some are looking into getting scanners to take people’s temperatures. I’m sure on bigger productions they’ll be investing in that kind of kit to keep people safe.”Another issue is insurance. Eaton said there was a fear that if filming starts again and there is a Covid-19 outbreak on set, productions that are not sufficiently covered could be plunged into financial uncertainty. “If you start filming and your lead actor gets ill or has the symptoms, then you’d have to stop, and everyone who they’re in contact with would have to self-isolate.“The worst thing that could happen is that someone starts filming soon and you get a case and that leads to more infections. If that happens, I’m sure they will close us all down again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3a33c19d3734b3c441732f7facb633c85b6c701/0_0_4293_2575/master/4293.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b9ace43c3bf19c886b0715d807f51996","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. Arrivals will have been subjected to the same lockdown restrictions imposed on the wider population since 23 March.In a heated exchange Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, who was appearing as a guest member, asked Aston if ministers had a central estimate of the number of people arriving each week who might have Covid-19 when the decision to stop asking any arrivals to self-isolate was made.“It would delay the epidemic by a small amount of time and therefore it was deemed that wasn’t a sensible thing to do.”Cooper repeatedly asked for the estimate but it was not provided. She said: “Previously people were asked to self-isolate at the border for 14 days. Inexplicably when other countries were increasing their restrictions or their requirements to self-isolate, the UK lifted them all. It was before the peak in Spain, it was still around the peak in Italy, it was several weeks before the peak in UK.”Aston’s evidence comes as the government prepares to enforce a 14-day quarantine for arrivals by air at the UK border – a policy that some have suggested would have been more appropriate prior to the UK lockdown on 23 March.There were 18.1 million arrivals to the UK in the period from 1 January to 23 March across air, land and sea, of whom 273 air passengers were formally quarantined.Aston told the committee that between 1 April and 26 April there were 95,000 arrivals into the UK by air, of whom about 53,000 were UK citizens.Aston’s remarks jar with testimony given by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, who told the health and social care committee that the UK received a “big influx of cases” from Europe that “seeded right the way across the country”.The home affairs select committee has repeatedly requested the government publishes the scientific advice provided by Sage that informed its border policy.Stephen Doughty, a shadow minister and former member of the committee, who has been pursuing the issue of border policy during the crisis, said: “Simply claiming it’s all a bit complicated and refusing to publish the models on which these critical decisions were based is not good enough.“We need to see urgent publication of the models and scientific advice that led to the Cabinet deciding not to act when the pandemic was raging. The revelation that even since the lockdown likely more than 100,000 have entered with scant checks, also begs the urgent question – why has the government still not introduced measures?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a7f93c30a4941327e4af36e9961b5a4476b618/0_107_4234_2540/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=464a604c76fc17d8e836910175267c19","title":"are children less susceptible to coronavirus","story":"As countries look to ease school and play restrictions, what evidence is there that children react differently?Does this mean children are less susceptible?There is now a wealth of evidence that children generally experience milder symptoms when they are infected – although there have been rare cases of children becoming seriously ill or even dying. However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programmes, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travellers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections.Studies on this question give a mixed picture. One analysis, in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, of households with confirmed Covid-19 in Shenzhen, China, found that children younger than ten were just as likely as adults to get infected. However, there is other evidence from South Korea, Italy and Iceland suggesting lower infection rates among children. Some of the difference could also be down to differences in social mixing.Why do children react differently to adults?For many infectious diseases, there is a U-shaped risk curve, with the youngest and oldest in society being most vulnerable. Covid-19 does not follow this pattern – even toddlers and newborn babies typically only experience mild symptoms. One theory is that children’s lungs might contain fewer of the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to enter cells. To confirm this, researchers would need to study tissue samples from children. Another possibility is that children’s immune systems respond in a more optimal way to the virus – mounting a strong enough response to get rid of the infection, but without going into overdrive and flooding the body with inflammatory proteins, which are known to sometimes cause problems in adult patients.Are children invisible transmitters?Asymptomatic transmission is known to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 – studies have shown that in general people appear to be at their most infectious in the day or so before symptoms start. This raises the question of whether children are silent spreaders of the virus. A recent German study, which compared the viral load of nearly 4,000 people aged from one to 100 years old, added weight to this idea. It found that regardless of age, people appeared to shed a similar level of virus, suggesting they could be equally infectious. However, a caveat is that the study did not measure real-life transmission in children. As schools reopen and community transmission is tracked closely in some European countries, a clearer answer on this is likely to emerge in the coming months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/738274d137fac4f0308c7ac4afc63cface70e35d/0_370_5098_3060/master/5098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f88f6d358038575cf4a0d217f31c49c","title":"brazil mexico coronavirus pandemic latin america","story":"Countries log highest single-day death tolls to date amid ambivalent and delayed reactions from the governments Brazil and Mexico have logged their highest single-day coronavirus death tolls to date, raising fears the pandemic is surging across Latin America amid ambivalent and delayed reactions from the governments of its two most populous countries.In Brazil – where the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has dismissed the virus as “a little flu” – the health ministry reported a new grim record of 881 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday night. It has now confirmed 12,461 deaths, the sixth-highest death toll in the world, and 178,214 cases.Mexico also reached a new landmark on Tuesday night, reporting 353 new deaths over the previous 24 hours and 1,997 new confirmed cases.A relatively low number of 108 deaths had been recorded on Monday, sparking hopes that the country was containing the spread because the daily toll had been falling since last week. But the figures from Tuesday renewed concerns about its response and took the number of confirmed cases to 38,324 with 3,926 deaths in total.Bolsonaro, who has shrugged off the pandemic’s increasing death toll, did not comment on the new figures as nurses demonstrated in Brasília on Tuesday night for International Nurses Day.On their backs, printed in black, were the names of 109 colleagues who have so far lost their lives to Covid-19. He did, however, tweet his congratulations to nurses “fighting on the frontline”.Although Brazil is the worst-hit country in Latin America – and has the seventh-highest number of cases in the world – restrictions on movement have been imposed on just a handful of cities in a country of 211 million people.While most of the country’s 27 governors have criticised Bolsonaro’s stance, none has imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, they have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or left mayors to make those decisions.Alexandre Telles, the president of the state’s doctors union, Sinmed, accused the president of “totally irresponsible” behaviour over the pandemic.“It is a posture that disrespects life and the Brazilian population,” he said. “I don’t see the curve of the disease reducing without us enforcing social distancing measures.”Telles – who works at Rio’s overloaded Ronaldo Gazolla hospital, which specialises in Covid-19 cases – said that there were 1,300 patients in the city waiting for hospital beds, many in overcrowded health centres. Yet people are increasingly disobeying social distancing guidelines, either because they have to work or because Bolsonaro has told them to.“Rio’s health system was not prepared for this pandemic, in spite of the warning signs,” Telles said. “We have had days without basic medicine to sedate patients.”On Wednesday, a Brazilian supreme court judge ordered the release of Bolsonaro’s own coronavirus tests. The negative result backed up the president’s previous claim of a clean bill of health, but doubts lingered after it was revealed that the three tests also were carried out nearly two months ago – since then Bolsonaro has repeatedly flouted social distancing advice and mixed with crowds of supporters and ordinary Brazilians.Mexico is also facing a rising death toll – and questions over its response to the pandemic as the government pushes to reopen the economy.Investigations by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and El País have all suggested that the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador is severely undercounting both cases and deaths.But Mexico has been under pressure from US officials to open businesses – especially auto plants and export factories along its northern border.On Wednesday, the Mexican president claimed victory, saying: “The safe-distancing campaign has brought us control – a flattening of the curve” as his government unveiled plans to relaunch its flagging economy.Construction, mining and car manufacturing will be declared “essential” activities and resume operations on 18 May. On the same day, schools and businesses in areas with low Covid-19 case numbers – dubbed “municipalities of hope” – will start reopening with the rest of the country projected to reopen on 1 June.“Let’s move toward this new mortality,” said Jorge Alcocer, the health secretary, before correcting himself: “New normality.”The reopening comes amid persistent fears that its public health response – which has depended on a disease modeling rather than widespread testing – has failed to capture the scope of the crisis.Analysts say Mexico’s Covid-19 statistics must be read with nuance since there is a lag in the reporting of health information: the nightly death toll does not necessarily reflect the number of deaths the previous day.An analysis in the magazine Nexos also cautioned that simply reading the nightly Covid-19 numbers makes it hard to know if the curve is flattening.But Dr Alejandro Macías, Mexico’s former flu commissioner, tweeted on Tuesday after the record death toll was announced: “It’s the largest number until now and shows the we are still on the increase … It’s likely we haven’t seen the worst. The United States, a country with three times the population, has already registered 20 times more deaths.”Chile’s government announced plans for a compulsory quarantine for the 6.5 million inhabitants of its capital Santiago – the strictest measures for the country which until now had employed localised lockdowns.The Associated Press contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e3e9ea996f5e2a7649b6bee62cb38bb63dfef81/0_242_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15a65899af67bf7d55bbcfd4daffda1c","title":"gardening helps me to deal with things englands garden centres reopen lockdown coronavirus","story":"Customers flock to buy plants after forced lockdown as owners worry closures came at worst time of year Spaced 2 metres apart, many wearing masks and gloves, customers were queueing outside Chessington garden centre in Surrey at 8am on Wednesday morning, an hour before the doors were allowed to open for the first time in more than seven weeks.Shoppers eager to snap up geraniums, begonias and tomato plants were greeted by staff wearing plastic visors and followed a new one-way system to allow shoppers to maintain a safe distance from each other. Trolleys were sprayed with disinfectant after use.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..Nevertheless, 75-year-old Roger Bruce, a theatre manager, was upbeat. “It’s like Christmas,” he said, his trolley laden with colourful hanging baskets and bedding plants. “We need to bring some colour to our lives.” “I’ve been desperate to come,” said Grete Smith, walking the aisles clutching a hand-written shopping list, accompanied by her husband, Clive. A clinical nursing specialist for a private company, she was dedicating some of her three weeks of furlough at home to tending their garden, not least because they expect to spend the summer there instead of going abroad.The government announcement that centres in England could reopen on Wednesday – following the Welsh government decision to allow trading to resume from Monday – was a “relief” for Jolyon Martin, managing director of Chessington garden centre.Martin’s parents started the business in 1967 and it is just a stone’s throw from the Chessington World of Adventures theme park, whose car park has been commandeered to become a drive-through, privately-run coronavirus testing centre.Martin said he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout at the sprawling site and that the store’s main car park was almost full by mid-morning.But the queue for the tills provided him only limited comfort, as he calculated the impact of the shutdown during the business’s peak March-to-May plant selling season.Martin said he believed it was unfair retailers such as supermarkets, and DIY chains including B\u0026ampQ and Homebase, were allowed to continue selling plants during the lockdown while his business had to remain closed.Ian Wylie, chief executive of the Garden Centre Association, said about a quarter of the UK’s 2000 centres reopened on Wednesday, with the remainder expected to be back up and running by the weekend, once staff are trained in new safety measures.Alan Roper, managing director of Blue Diamond, said customer behaviour had changed: leisurely browsing had stopped and efficient shopping had replaced it. “It’s a mission to shop. They are doing a clean sweep and making sure that they get everything on the shopping list. “I think trade will be good for the next few weeks because of that pent-up latent demand. The issue is going to be securing stock, particularly on the nursery side, where they have been dealt a heavy blow,” Roper added.The abrupt closure of the UK’s 2000 garden centres came at the worst time of year for nurseries and plant growers, who had to throw away millions of pounds’ worth of seasonal plants they had cultivated for the peak sales period. ﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fb23fed66463be1d8c4c0e7245604478c04e971/0_0_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7da81d21f68a5c1517e644bc9b10037","title":"global report eu urges reopening of borders as masks debate continues","story":"Some countries begin limited relaxation of travel restrictions as debate over use of masks rumbles onHotels, restaurants and beaches across Europe are being asked to enforce social distancing between guests, including booking slots at the pool and keeping 1.5m apart in the buffet queue, as the EU has urged a gradual reopening of the bloc’s internal borders to salvage at least some of the summer holiday season.With debate over rules on masks continuing in several European countries, the European commission called on Wednesday for a “careful” easing of restrictions and unveiled guidelines ranging from wearing face coverings on planes and trains to maintaining physical distancing on the beach and in hotels.“This is not going to be a normal summer, not for any of us,” the European commission vice-president, Margrethe Vestager, said. She urged governments and businesses to follow Brussels’ recommendations so that “we don’t have to face a summer stuck at home – or a completely lost summer for the European tourist industry”.Hotels are being asked to consider enabling guests to book slots at the pool, gym or restaurant. Large public spaces such as buffets should ensure guests not in the same family can remain at least 1.5 metres apart, while big events such as concerts are discouraged.Guests should be advised on “respiratory etiquette”, namely sneezing or coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, and issued with frequent reminders to wash their hands. Hotels would also be expected to keep address records to allow contact tracing in the event of an outbreak of coronavirus.“Today’s guidance can be the chance of a better season for the many Europeans whose livelihood depends on tourism and of course for those who would like to travel this summer,” Vestager said.Travellers are being asked to wear face masks on all modes of transport and in airports and stations, and transport workers to wear masks and gloves. Buses, trains and ferries are encouraged to run with fewer people, although airlines will not be required to leave middle seats empty.Germany said on Wednesday that it would start relaxing entry controls on its borders with EU members from this weekend, but Spain, one of the continent’s biggest tourist destinations, said it could wait until July.Decisions on the reopening of borders are the responsibility of national governments, but the commission urged the 27 member states to coordinate lifting their restrictions in stages, starting with countries with low levels of coronavirus.European governments are already pressing ahead with their own plans to reopen at different speeds depending on their national circumstances. The three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania will reopen borders to each others’ citizens, creating a “travel bubble”, from 15 May.The EU’s external borders are to remain closed to non-essential travel until at least mid-June.Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said Berlin had “set the clear goal of free travel in Europe by mid-June”. Checks on the border with Luxembourg would be be dropped as early as Saturday, he said, and Berlin was consulting with Copenhagen on lifting all controls on the Danish border.Germany also plans to open all border crossings with France, Switzerland and Austria, rather than selected ones as at present, with spot checks replacing systematic controls.Earlier, Vienna said it was opening its borders with Germany and working on staggered reopenings with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and some eastern European countries.Spain will however impose a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from abroad from Friday, and two foreign ministry sources told Reuters that Madrid aimed to keep its borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July.The head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies, Fernando Simón, has recommended the wearing of masks in all public spaces, amid reports that the government is considering making their use compulsory. At present masks are mandatory only on public transport. They have been handed out at train and metro stations.Simón said the best measure to control the virus was “keeping the two-metre distance”, but added that masks “can be really helpful when it comes to controlling the epidemic”.In Germany, face masks are obligatory on public transport and, in most regions, inside shops, but increasing numbers of people are taking legal action arguing that masks hinder personal expression and are not proven to be an effective tool against curbing the virus.Masks are also obligatory on public transport in France, and most stores prefer shoppers to wear them. The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has again asked the government if she can reopen the city’s parks and gardens and said she would make it mandatory to wear a mask in them if permission is granted.The Belgian government said schools, museums and hairdressers would be allowed to start reopening under strict distancing and hygiene conditions from 18 May. Marriages and funerals will be allowed to go ahead with no more than 30 guests, and street markets may start trading again with a maximum of 50 traders, who must wear masks.Russia, Europe’s new coronavirus hotspot, again reported more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday. The health minister, Mikhail Murashko, said more than 100,000 patients had been hospitalised.Fears are growing of a second wave in China, with the north-eastern city of Jilin put in partial lockdown and Wuhan, where the virus first appeared last year, preparing to test its entire population after clusters of new cases.The coronavirus has infected 4.3 million people worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, and killed more than 293,000.With reporting from Sam Jones in Madrid and Kate Connolly in Berlin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500ac61b1c194e765f4b0b9478de5b95932cacc8/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bb748f2051b76a1c94d9153866e670b","title":"ministers pressed for clarity on length of lockdown for most vulnerable","story":"Growing group of 2.5 million people told they are likely to have to stay in ‘beyond June’Ministers are facing calls to end the limbo of “indefinite” isolation for 2.5 million people shielding from coronavirus, amid claims that the numbers added to the “extremely vulnerable” list have doubled in some areas in the last week.Labour said it was “deeply alarming” that hundreds of thousands more people had been added to the list of those required to isolate indoors over the last seven weeks, suggesting they were put at risk unnecessarily by initially being missed off.The opposition also called for clarity on how long they would have to put their lives on hold, as government sources said a review of the “extremely clinically vulnerable” status was likely to conclude that many in that group would have to continue to isolate over the summer months.A group of 1.5 million “extremely clinically vulnerable” people in England were initially advised to shield by not leaving their homes for 12 weeks from 23 March until 15 June.This was extended to the “end of June” but the government’s coronavirus recovery plan released on Monday revealed it was now “likely that the government will continue to advise people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to shield beyond June”. The government said this amounted to 2.5 million people across the UK, of whom 2.1 million are in England.Steve Reed, the shadow communities and local government secretary, said there needed to be an explanation about why so many people had initially been left off the list.“The government’s inability to work collaboratively to provide PPE and roll out testing has already put people at risk and now it appears they left vulnerable people in danger because of their disjointed approach to shielding,” he said.“People currently shielding have been led to believe they could be asked to isolate for an indefinite period they deserve clarity from the government about how long they will have to put their lives on hold.”Labour said it was concerned that vulnerable people were still being left off the list, leading to rises in the number shielding even though the UK is seven weeks into its lockdown.Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, said: “What are the government doing to improve their efforts to identify and notify those in high-risk categories? Local authorities are reporting huge errors. They initially raised their concerns that the numbers seemed too low, but were not asked to contribute their knowledge as data identification was being undertaken centrally.“It now appears that thousands of people were initially missed off, and in some areas local authorities have been told that the numbers of citizens to be shielded have more than doubled in the last week.”GPs claim the process of drawing up and updating the “shielding” list has been complicated.One GP said: “It was a stupid idea for the government to give the public the impression that it would be a simple thing to do – that all doctors had to do was push a button on their computer to find those patients who needed to be on the ‘shielding’ list.”People who did not need to be on the list, for example because they only had a mild form of asthma or hypertension, or recovered many years earlier from a disease such as cancer, were initially included.Conversely, others were excluded, because the extraction and analysis of data from various NHS records systems – some maintained by GPs, others by hospital doctors – failed to correctly identify their extra risk from Covid and thus the need to stay indoors.The list has also risen to 2.5 million because patients not on the original list approached their GP to request to go on it, often because they were scared of contracting Covid as a result of going into work.The government’s review of shielding iniduals is being led by the Department of Health and Social Care and will report by the end of next month.“As each day passes we learn more about this virus and its impact on people, and we will continue to do all we can to protect people.”Those currently in the shielding group include people with specific cancers, solid organ transplant recipients, those with severe respiratory conditions, people with certain conditions that suppress the immune system and pregnant women with significant heart disease.The review is likely to produce advice that is more nuanced about which categories of people are facing the greatest risk, advising some they may be able to take more risks and others that they need to be more cautious.The government’s medical advisers are also considering the impact of other risk factors such as how the virus disproportionally affects older people, men, people who are overweight and those with other underlying conditions. It is conducting a separate review of the impact of coronavirus on the death rate for those from minority ethnic backgrounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3465951f1eb6c102c584cf0372dbbf526c81ee50/0_140_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=421d50a4d01fe44e1e388a29e87670a6","title":"mixed messages tories wealth ahead wellbeing coronavirus","story":"The government’s revised lockdown advice is muddled and rife with contradictions, but their priorities are crystal clearBoris Johnson has urged the public to rely on their “British common sense” as lockdown restrictions are progressively eased over the coming months.But as estate agents joined nannies and cleaners on the list of workers allowed to enter people’s homes, while friends and family can’t come round for a cup of tea or to visit their grandchildren, questions are being raised about whether the latest rules make any sense, British or otherwise.One anomaly was highlighted by Kate, the teacher who asked Johnson a question at Monday’s press conference: why was it OK for her to mix with a class full of children when schools reopen on 1 June, but not acceptable to see members of her own family?The truth is that while they can’t quite bring themselves to say it plainly, ministers are prioritising getting the economy moving again over cheering up those who are lonely and sad after seven weeks’ isolation.English schools are set to reopen because, as the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, put it on Wednesday, they are “the best place for children to be educated and to learn”, but also so that at least some working parents can increase their productivity by not having to juggle their jobs with home schooling.It is not hard to discern why. Wednesday’s catastrophic data from the Office for National Statistics suggested a deep recession is brewing and job losses are accelerating, despite the taxpayer subsidising 7.5m workers’ salaries.Allowing some aspects of economic life to resume may help to limit the longer-term scars inflicted by the overnight shutdown at the end of March – but it does not come without risks.What the government is having to decide is which risks are worth taking first. And as Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, puts it: “In the short term, they’re prioritising the risk that comes with a money payoff, over the risk that comes with an emotional payoff.”In Monday’s “Plan to Rebuild” document, the government describes its approach as “saving lives, saving livelihoods”.“The longer the virus affects the economy, the greater the risks of long-term scarring and permanently lower economic activity, with business failures, persistently higher unemployment and lower earnings,” it says, pointing out that many of those worst affected by a prolonged recession would be the young and the low-paid.But while the government’s roadmap repeatedly makes reference to “fairness”, the risks of the gradual reopening will not be borne evenly.Stark Office for National Statistics data on which occupations have seen the highest death rates from the virus underlined the fact that low-paid workers have been most at risk – and many more are in the sectors, including construction and manufacturing, now being asked to return, albeit with new safety rules in place.It hasn’t helped, either, that Johnson bungled the messaging about what would change this this week and when – and urged workers to avoid the crush of public transport, which for many will be impossible.Despite the unprecedented generosity of the furlough scheme, that may ultimately make it harder to maintain Rishi Sunak’s insistence that “we are all in this together” – a claim last used by a Conservative chancellor when George Osborne was slashing the welfare bill.The public may have a different understanding of the risks, and a different appetite for accepting them.The devolved nations certainly appear to, and are continuing to stick to the “stay at home” message – though ministers in Westminster argue that’s understandable, because the outbreak is at different stages in different places.Even if the focus on the economy may be understandable, the emotional and social cost of the lockdown is intensifying.A report for Conservative thinktank Onward warned last week of the heavy toll on the nation’s mental health, with the potential for “increased levels of depression, harmful use of alcohol and drugs, as well as self-harm or suicidal behaviour”.That is one reason it may be hard to maintain consent for nitpicking restrictions about who can meet whom in the park, and in what circumstances, as people increasingly yearn for contact with their loved ones.Another is that the public may apply the “British common sense” that Johnson is trumpeting, and decide that if the government thinks an encounter with an estate agent is a risk worth taking, it’s fine for their mum to pop round.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/642b7e954cf11878f83f15f9233d233254d56fda/0_134_2048_1230/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=65338dd1b95785699729bbbf9adced3f","title":"why should you cry ghanas dancing pallbearers find new fame during covid 19","story":"Benjamin Aidoo, the group’s leader, wants to teach the world to hold joyful funerals, and is planning to expand his business across the globeThe Nana Otafrija pallbearers might look slick, but they are not afraid to get dirty. Their signature moves, carried out with a coffin in tow, include dropping to all-fours and crawling in unison or lying on their backs, the coffin balanced on top of them, legs moving in time to the music – as though they have been crushed by the casket.The dancing pallbearers first became famous in 2017 when their so-called “coffin dance” featured in a BBC documentary. Then, someone added an EDM track and a meme was born: footage of the dancers was spliced with botched feats of strength and other accidents and posted all over the internet.Now, the coronavirus pandemic has transformed their performance into a way to warn people of the dangers of ignoring social distancing.In India, policemen dressed in uniform danced along to the track while carrying a (healthy) man on a stretcher. In Peru, police dressed in riot gear did the same, with a mock coffin.The dance has even been used by protesters mourning the economy in Lebanon: in Beirut men dressed as the pallbearers marched a mock coffin decorated with the fast-depreciating Lebanese Lira down the streets.Fans can buy miniatures of the Nana Otafrija dancers from Hong Kong, or go to a Taiwanese bar where drinks are served by pallbearers. There’s also a video game-inspired version, where Mario dies and the pallbearers appear in pixellated form, moving in time to chiptune.Benjamin Aidoo, the lead pallbearer, lists the Mario version among his favourites. His dancers have also taken it upon themselves to warn the public about the dangers of ignoring social distancing measures, with the help of a new slogan: “Stay at home or dance with us”.Speaking from his home in Accra, Aidoo told the  that he started working as a pallbearer while in high school in 2003. He came up with the idea of dancing with the coffin because he wanted people to be able to celebrate their dead. He also noticed that people would often grow so upset at their solemn funerals that they would faint or injure themselves. If they could focus on the dancing, he reasoned, they would be less likely to get hurt.Once the pandemic is over, Aidoo hopes to teach people around the world to hold uplifting funerals.“Most people love the display”, said Aidoo, “because they want to be happy.” When people’s parents die, for example, “You know what your mom and dad did for you,” said Aidoo. “Why should you cry?”“When you know the life that he or she spent before dying, I think it’s a great thing for you to celebrate.”Things changed for Aidoo’s business when the family of a member of parliament who had died hired Aidoo and his fellow pallbearers – but insisted they wear all-white, matching outfits. The MP’s family paid for the outfits and the funeral celebration went so well that they tipped handsomely, too.“That was the first time I ever saw a $100 bill,” said Aidoo.After that, he said, “I had a vision for what I am doing.” Aidoo now employs about 100 staff: 95 men and five women. Two of the women are lead pallbearers, like Aidoo: they march in front of the coffin with a cane – decorated with the Ghanaian flag – and top hat.Aidoo has also recently hired a managerand together the pair are trying to build a global brand. Asked how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting his business in Ghana, Aidoo explained that funerals are now restricted to 25 people – including pallbearers – and are sombre affairs. There’s no singing and dancing – so some people are keeping their loved ones’ bodies in the morgue until restrictions are lifted and they’re able to hold a large burial, with his dancers.Once the pandemic is over his plans he hopes to travel and to open branches of his pallbearing business in other countries, where people will be able to hire Adioo-style coffin dancers.He urged his fans to “Stay safe, stay alive, respect the rules and regulations given to them.”“One day we will surely get there. This pandemic will be over and then we’ll all meet.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3c1c1d7ad3459d4227fe5ad0cf8fdd2dcb216d6/1863_547_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84a7c087f96ec237590b3a4fa15b7cf3","title":"tokyos state of emergency in pictures","story":"As Japan considers lifting state-of-emergency conditions in many regions this week and the country inches towards a gradual return of economic activity, photographer Dai Kurokawa looks at life in the capital"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252808.1589404485!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one way traffic system to be introduced in south dublin s blackrock","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSkirted by the N31, a major road artery, Blackrock is a sizeable village with a main street and numerous commercial premises.A one-way traffic system is to be put in place in the south Dublin village of Blackrock by the end of the month in order to ensure safe public distancing during the Covid-19 emergency. On Wednesday, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council said it had taken the decision to facilitate safe physical distancing, mobility and the re-opening of local businesses. The installation of a temporary one-way traffic system will see space reallocated for pedestrians and cyclists.“The Council are working on this initiative with the support of the Blackrock Business Network. The details of the plan are currently being worked on and will be finalised next week,” it said in a statement. “It is envisaged that the temporary changes will be implemented in the village from Wednesday, 27th May.”It said whatever emerges will not adversely affect public transport serving the village and any temporary materials would be “both functional and sympathetic to the public realm”. The council is in the process of preparing a county-wide plan of temporary measures to address the challenges presented by Covid-19 including public safety, mobility and the recovery of the local economy, it said. It should completed in the next two weeks.Skirted by the N31, a major road artery, Blackrock is a sizeable village with a main street and numerous commercial premises bordered to the east by the sea and the north by a large park. It is also surrounded by extensive suburban environs with a considerable population. In response to the announcement, the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Cycling Group said it believed the plan would likely include a contra-flow lane for cycling, improving safe access to the village “to the many families who shop an exercise here”. That remains unverified. Reaction on social media to changing the layout of the commercial village was generally positive. “There are five car parks in Blackrock, plus on street parking just off Main Street,” one post noted. “I think it’s great that the council are looking at ways to make the village safer for pedestrians \u0026amp cyclists as the footpaths are so narrow and there are no bike lanes.”Green Party councillor Séafra Ó Faoláin tweeted that full credit for the move went to the local business community and residents “for putting the proposal together”.

This was because vitamin D deficiency was common among those at risk of Covid-19 (particularly older people) there was no toxic risk from taking it at the recommended dosage level, and growing evidence of benefits.Last week, scientists at Northwestern University in the US found those with severe vitamin D deficiency were twice as likely to experience Covid-19 complications.If changing advice led to a rush of products on sale in shops, “it is not a reason not to take it . . . This is no time to hang around”, she added.“While there are currently no results from randomised controlled trials to conclusively prove that vitamin D beneficially affects Covid-19 outcomes, there is strong circumstantial evidence of associations between vitamin D and the severity of Covid-19 responses, including death.”Daily sunshineIn England, Scotland and Wales, public health bodies have revised recommendations since the Covid-19 outbreak to say all adults should take at least 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D daily.Prof Kenny said most scientists would recommend between 800 and 1,000 IU – she takes the higher dose – and recommended older people be exposed to 10 to 15 minutes of sunshine daily, if possible.Vitamin D is produced in the skin from UVB sunlight exposure. It is changed into an active hormone that keeps the skeleton strong and free of osteoporosis. It is also contained in many foods, such as oily fish and cheese, while most people ensure they have adequate amounts through a combination of sunlight and a healthy diet.Controversially, US president Donald Trump suggested zapping the virus with sunlight or UV but this was not related to the vitamin D connection in boosting the immune system.In response to the study, a Department of Health spokeswoman said the National Public Health Emergency Team which advises the Government on Covid-19, “keeps all national and international evidence and advice under continuous review as the basis for any recommendations”.Cytokine stormsThe TCD data, produced in collaboration with Prof Jon Rhodes at the University of Liverpool, suggests it is likely to reduce serious Covid-19 complications. “This may be because vitamin D is important in regulation and suppression of the inflammatory cytokine response, which causes the severe consequences of Covid-19 and ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’ associated with ventilation and death,” Prof Kenny explained.Cytokine storms seem to kill a majority of Covid-19 patients, and not destruction of the lungs by the virus itself.This study shows – counterintuitively – countries at lower latitude and typically sunny countries, such as Spain and northern Italy, had low concentrations of vitamin D and high rates of deficiency. These countries also experienced the highest Covid infection and death rates in Europe.Northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland and Sweden) have higher vitamin D levels despite less UVB sunlight exposure, because supplementation and fortification of foods is more common. These countries have lower Covid infection and death rates.Vitamin D deficiency is common in Ireland and is most prevalent with age, obesity, in men, in ethnic minorities, in people with diabetes, hypertension and in nursing homes.Dr Laird said: “Optimising vitamin D intake to public health guidelines will certainly have benefits for overall health and support immune function. Research like this is still exploratory and we need further trials to have concrete evidence on the level of vitamin D that is needed for optimal immune function.“Supplementation is the best means of ensuring sufficient vitamin D blood levels. As the effects of coronavirus continue, many of us are limited in the time we can spend outdoors, so extra care is required to keep vitamin D levels healthy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"NZ\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowellbeing\u0026rsquo approach understood to have influenced FG, FF framework documentConfidential document prepared as frontline workers scheme is scrappedMedian turnaround for results currently five days, far short of three-day target, says Donnelly\u0026lsquoVery desirable\u0026rsquo that nursing home residents get to see loved ones againThe Food Cult project seeks to understand the social, economic and political relevance of food in 16th century IrelandResearch lives: Barbara Gormley, post-graduate researcher at DCU School of CommunicationsTravel agents are \u0026lsquothe worst off\u0026rsquo industry due to Covid-19, says association headMedical chief rejects Taoiseach\u0026rsquos view schools could reopen earlier than plannedHarold\u0026rsquos Cross bridge was blocked to traffic after object was removed from Grand CanalChild protection expert Ian Elliott\u0026rsquos awaited report into past child sex abuse completedNew system will see space reallocated for pedestrians and cyclists, says councilT\u0026aacutenaiste says government needs \u0026lsquolegitimacy and a majority\u0026rsquo to make decisions requiredIncident involved a tractor on a family farm in the Malin areaOnly six providers volunteered for scheme set up for workers during Covid-19 pandemicEverything you need to know about Ireland\u0026rsquos current test and trace system105 people seeking international protection were transferred to centre during pandemicFurther 10 deaths and 159 cases of Covid-19 reported in the StateOpening up air travel: \u0026lsquoI hope it\u0026rsquoll be this year, but it\u0026rsquos certainly going to be months rather than weeks\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash TaoiseachStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252739.1589396614!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus holohan dismisses possibility of reopening schools early","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan says he is concerned that contacts per Covid-19 case will be driven up should people attend social gatherings during phase one of the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer, Department of Health. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe possibility of schools reopening earlier than planned was dismissed by the State’s chief medical officer as he played down the Taoiseach’s enthusiasm that it could happen sooner.Dr Tony Holohan rejected any view that there there was “mounting evidence” showing that children do not appear to be super spreaders of the coronavirus as previously thought.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier on Wednesday that reopening schools for children was “among the safest things” that the State could do, pointing to a report by State regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority, and comments by WHO official Mike Ryan.“The emerging evidence is that among the safest things that we can do over the next couple of months is to reopen our schools and to reopen our childcare facilities to allow children to return to education and to return to normal life,” Mr Varadkar said.Later, Dr Holohan said that there was “a very small number of studies” involving “small numbers of children” and insufficient evidence to change advice on the reopening of schools.He told the Department of Health’s evening briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic that the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team would be meeting on Thursday to consider whether the first wave of the lockdown relaxations could be proceed as planned next Monday, May 18th.He was “not anticipating at this moment” any changes on schools reopening before planned at the start of next school year from September or in the advice that NPHET would give on that.“We don’t have very many studies at this point in time that looked at this question. Those that have looked at this question haven’t identified a significant pattern of transmission among children,” said Dr Holohan on the studies on transmission of the coronavirus among children.“It is an entirely different thing to conclude in policy terms that we have enough evidence to say that transmission from children doesn’t occur but as yet it hasn’t been identified as a significant issue in the small number of studies that have been done.”New casesThe deaths of another 10 patients from Covid-19 were announced by National Public Health Emergency Team at its briefing on Wednesday. There have now been 1,497 Covid-19 related deaths in the State.There were 159 new cases of Covid-19 confirmed bringing the total number of cases confirmed over the course of the pandemic to 23,401.The median age of confirmed cases is 48 years, according to data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Fifty-seven per cent are female and 43 per cent are male.Thirteen per cent of cases, a total of 3,050, have been hospitalised, with 389 cases admitted to ICU.Dublin has the highest number of cases at 11,242 (49 per cent of all cases), followed by Kildare with 1,344 cases (6 per cent) and Cork with 1,238 cases (5 per cent).Community transmission accounts for 60 per cent, close contact 37 per cent and travel abroad 3 per cent. Eighty-four per cent of people have recovered from coronavirus.ResearchEarlier, the Government has signalled its concern at the increasing numbers of people in the population who feel the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic is over. Research conducted for the Department of Health showed that 43 per cent now believe the worst has passed, which might lead to less adherence to social distancing rules. “We have so far avoided a situation where the system is overwhelmed,” said Liz Canavan of the Department of An Taoiseach at the Government press briefing on Wednesday. “We need to be conscious of the devastating impact of Covid-19. The risk is still there.”She pointed to the World Health Organisation opinion that the virus will recur in waves. She said that even when restrictions were relaxed the public should continue with safe practices as there will be periods when numbers will increase again. “The public are asked to stay the course,” she said.Ms Canavan pointed to more positive figures from other research conducted this week that showed a marked increase in the number of people who will use sanitiser (up to 71 per cent from 59 per cent) who will sit further apart in future (up to 61 per cent from 36 per cent) and who intend to stay at home (up to 34 per cent from 6 per cent). She also said that over 90 per cent were washing their hands regularly and standing the required distance apart in queues. She added that 78 per cent of respondents now said they coughed into their elbow and adhered to the guidance on coughing etiquette.Water shortageMeanwhile, the prolonged period of dry weather has led to the possibility of water shortages, the Government has said. In the daily briefing at Government buildings, households were asked to introduce measures to conserve water. The conservation advice does not apply to hand-washing with people being advised to wash their hands as regularly as they can. That should have priority over less essential uses of water.Ms Canavan said that households should avoid using power washers, use watering cans rather than hoses in gardens, and also to fix leaky taps. She said that Irish Water had issued guidance for households, businesses and farms on how best to conserve water.At a Government briefing, it was also disclosed that the Garda has invoked the Covid-regulation a total of 192 times since March. That includes arresting people for not observing the emergency laws, as well as taking names and addresses of those who have failed to comply with the rules. The Garda continue to report a very high level of compliance throughout the State.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252512.1589399706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus q a why does contact tracing matter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tExperts have said in recent days the entire testing and contact tracing continuum has to be completed within three days.. Photograph: Francesca VolpiBloombergWhy does test and trace matter?As we move out of lockdown, breaking the chains of transmission – identifying and contacting people who have been in touch with known cases before they asymptomatically spread the virus – is the cornerstone of returning to a “new normal”. If this is not effective, we may lose control of the virus again, and end up back in lockdown.What does it involve?Experts have said in recent days the entire testing and contact tracing continuum has to be completed within three days. That means from the time you’re referred for swabbing to the time all your contacts are interviewed.According to information released by the HSE on Wednesday evening, the median time from referral for testing to completion of contact tracing is “circa four days when you consider hospitals and community together”. It did not provide updated information on average times, but previously it has said the contact tracing element takes on average 36 hours, and testing takes on average 2.4 days.For tests taken among the community, ie not in residential facilities or hospitals, the median turnaround time is five days. Hospitals can get the whole process done in around two days.The HSE says a positive test result is uploaded to the Covid Care Tracker system in 90 minutes. The aim then is to do three calls as quickly as possible. Call one informs someone of their status, call two gathers close contact information, and call three is to the close contacts. Unanswered calls are repeated, which can add time.Is it going fast enough?Based on information the HSE released on Wednesday evening (the figure changes every day), across the last seven days it takes a median of 0.6 days to get swabbed, 3.5 days to get a lab result for a community test, and one day for contact tracing to commence and be completed.It is not clear how contact tracing can commence and be completed in one day if, as the HSE has said, it takes a median time of 20 hours to complete the first of three calls in the process.It seems a best case scenario, say for a healthcare worker who is not a complex case (and therefore easy and fast to trace), the process might be completed in two days. The process in the community is now taking a median time of five days. But as the HSE says, these figures are medians, so routine tracing may be faster and very complex tracing can take longer.The information supplied suggests that on most occasions outside hospitals, the process is taking much longer than experts believe it should.What is slowing it down?Because testing was targeted last month at residential facilities, direct provision, care homes and hospitals, there hasn’t been a vast amount of community testing done, and only around half of our capacity for testing was used last week. Therefore, there was less tracing to do as well.But there has been a lot of complex cases. Interviewing someone who has no English, or who has dementia, about their contacts in the past 10 days can be hard. Also, healthcare workers might come into contact with dozens of people, including vulnerable patients.While these complex cases are certainly slowing things down, other factors should be positively affecting turnaround time. For example, fast testing for healthcare workers should positively affect average turnaround times, while low numbers of contacts during lockdown should also be aiding speed.Is anything else slowing it down?Yes. Much of the testing system was built from scratch, in a hurry. Manual data entry results in errors. Sometimes key contact information is missing. Computer systems aren’t talking to each other. The failure to complete significant IT infrastructure upgrades like unique patient identifiers and lab information management systems appears to be playing a role.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252691.1589397747!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unifil mission for 350 irish troops extended until july","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Army Ranger wing on patrol as part of UN peacekeeping duties.Some 350 Irish troops serving in Lebanon will have to spend an extra six weeks in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The troops were originally due home in the middle of May but this was thrown into doubt when UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres banned rotations of all UN peacekeepers until June 30th to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Since then negotiations have been ongoing between the Irish Government and UN headquarters in New York to secure an exemption for the Irish troops on the Unifil mission in Lebanon who have been in the middle-eastern country for the last six months.However, family members received news on Wednesday that the troops will not return until the end of June, adding another six weeks to their mission.Defence sources suggested there is a small chance this date could be brought forward pending further negotiations.The 350 soldiers are likely to be rotated home on two flights, one at the end of June and one at the start of July. The Defence Forces is expected to charter a flight to rotate the troops.Once back in Ireland they will be forced to remain in quarantine for two weeks per HSE and UN guidelines. Furthermore, their replacements will be sent into quarantine in a Defence Forces training facility, most likely in the Glen of Imaal in Co Wicklow, from the middle of June until they deploy two weeks later.MaliLast month, Irish special forces troops were rotated home from Mali on time, despite the UN’s request for a delay. About 14 Army Ranger Wing personnel were flown home with the help of the German Air Force. The Spanish Air force assisted in rotating another seven Irish troops from a separate mission in Mali a week previously.Defence sources say it was much easier to rotate those missions on time due to the small numbers of troops involved.The UN order affects about 100,000 troops around the world. Officials in New York drew up the order amid fears of a repeat of the UN mission to Haiti in 2010 when peacekeepers brought in cholera, which went on to kill some 10,000.The Department of Defence said the Lebanon rotation will take place in two phases, known as “chalks”.“The indications at present are that the first chalk will take place in the latter part of June and the second in early July. However, contacts with the UN in New York are continuing about the scope to possibly bring these dates forward,” it said in a statement.“In recognition of these impacts, the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Defence Forces have had extensive engagement with the UN and UNIFIL headquarters in order to ensure these rotations take place as early as possible.”“Confirmation of the precise dates is expected very shortly and will be communicated in the first instance by the military authorities to both contingents (the contingent coming home and that going out to Lebanon).”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252795.1589402478!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"annual budget to focus on wellbeing of people as well as economic measures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed  that the State would “probably” borrow €30bn  this year, which was at the outer limits of the Government’s worst-case scenario calculations  a month agoA new method of calculating the annual budget to focus on the “wellbeing” of people as well as economic measurements is being discussed in government formation talks.The Green Party has raised a new “wellbeing budget” with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The party has cited the New Zealand “wellbeing budget” model first introduced by prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s government last year.The New Zealand approach is based on the idea that the long-term impact of polices on people’s lives is better than measuring progress from economic data.The first wellbeing budget in New Zealand saw significant investment in mental health, measures to combat domestic violence and major funding for improving children’s wellbeing, such as tackling child poverty. It also focused on climate measures, a digital economy and supporting minority groups such as the Maori community.The idea was discussed in a session on the economy on Wednesday, with sources saying budgeting must focus on “quality of life rather than economic growth”.The approach of Ms Ardern’s administration is understood to have influenced key people in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as they drew up the framework document – which included an “overriding focus...to improve the wellbeing of the Irish people and society” – between their two parties.It was pointed out by a well placed source that Gabriel Makhlouf, the governor of the Central Bank, was a key figure in the New Zealand treasury when this new approach was implemented, and that an Irish model should be driven by the Department of Finance.The meeting on the economy between the three parties was given a presentation by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe. He is said to have “laid it on the line”, with sources in both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael saying that all parties in the next government must be aware of the challenges and choices that lie ahead as the country emerges from the Covid-19 crisis. TransitionTánaiste Simon Coveney is said to have spoken about the risk of Britain exiting the post-Brexit transition with the EU without a deal at the end of the year.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed on Wednesday that the State would “probably” borrow €30 billion this year, which was at the outer limits of the Government’s worst-case scenario calculations less than a month ago.The Stability Programme Update in mid-April said the deficit would be €23 billion, but Mr Donohoe said this could rise to €30 billion if economic recovery was delayed.Numerous government figures, as well as those involved in coalition talks, said a deficit of €30 billion is now the likeliest scenario.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252772.1589400547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new plan for covid 19 testing commits to 72 hour turnaround time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE testing arrangements will contain  key performance indicators, including the number of tests per week, the turnaround time for results and targets for contact tracingA new plan for Covid-19 testing is to be published on Thursday committing to a 72-hour turnaround time for the the completion of test and contact tracing, as well as the long-promised target of 100,000 tests per week. The Health Service Executive plan will form a core part of new safeguards that will support the process of gradually easing restrictions from May 18th. The HSE testing arrangements will contain a series of key performance indicators, including the number of tests per week, the turnaround time for results and targets for contact tracing.It comes after criticism of the nine-day average turnaround from when a test is taken to results returning to the patient. Most experts recommend a 72-hour timeframe.Health officials have promised improvements, and have highlighted a range of technical issues including data-entry errors, a lack of automation and systems that cannot interact with each other which are delaying the issuing of results.The State claimed in March that it could achieve as many as 15,000 tests each day, later revised to 100,000 a week. However, until recent weeks the number of tests carried out has fallen well short of targets, which has contributed to the delays.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday he accepted some targets had not been met, but he said the HSE was now in a position to carry out 100,000 tests per week. He was confident the HSE could achieve a 72-hour turnaround time for test results and tracing.“I absolutely accept criticisms from anyone that says we should have done that sooner, but I can also guarantee that absolutely everyone across the system is pulling out all the stops to get to this point.“The target is absolutely to have a test result turnaround time of 72 hours, but it’ll never be 100 per cent, you know. There isn’t a test that I’m aware of where you get the results within 72 hours 100 per cent of the time.” Three daysFianna Fáil health spokesman Stephen Donnelly said the median turnaround for test results was currently five days, far short of the target of three days. He said the figures supplied to him by the HSE were “hugely underwhelming… It is very disappointing to hear it is taking so long.”His Sinn Féin counterpart, Louise O’Reilly, said it was more than six weeks since the target of 15,000 per day was announced. “They missed it and there is nothing to suggest that another target will help. The target is meaningless without the necessary tracing and isolation facilities.” The HSE said on Wednesday evening that the median time from referral for testing to the completion of contact tracing was “circa four days when you consider hospitals and community together”.Community tests – those not taken in hospitals or residential settings – take a median time of five days to complete the process, whereas hospital cases take a day to complete testing and another day for tracing, although this can be longer in complex cases. Such complex cases are more common in hospitals and care homes or direct provision centres as there may be more contacts, or there may be language barriers or complications arising from a person’s illness or even death. Challenging“The recent testing of residential care facilities was particularly challenging in ensuring the timely notification of results as there were thousands of residents and staff across over 600 settings. This process obviously pushes out the average time for contact tracing,” the HSE said.It said that it had no accurate figures on the split between complex and non-complex cases at the moment, but prior to the mass testing of nursing homes, “approximately 80 per cent of cases were marked as routine”.A senior HSE source told The  that the majority of tests would be turned around in 72 hours, but there would “always be outliers for more complex cases”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4252788.1589403912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"true wisdom says you can no more un lay a report than a hen can un lay an egg","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The unsinkable Alan Shatter.

Despite passionate arguments from terribly miffed Fine Gael TDs against the non-inclusion of their illustrious leader Leo Varadkar in the line-up for the high-profile first meeting, the list remains confined to the country’s three most senior health officials.Working arrangements are a major preoccupation of the Dáil’s complement of political distancers. Like spoilt toddlers on the look-out for sharp practice when the sweeties are doled out, TDs and political parties are instinctively vigilant to the threat of being short-changed by political rivals. “Not fair. They got more than us!” Normal PeopleThis is why the Business Committee, with its power to vy out speaking time and schedule debates, holds more intense sessions in private than your average episode of Normal People. Deputies who sit on it are well used to receiving urgent summonses to discuss overturning their latest decision because the colleagues who delegated them to make it have suddenly decided they don’t like it anymore.The Divvy-out Committee had already agreed the schedule for this week’s two sittings when the House reconvened, but a blast from a tenacious politician past soon upset the plans. And by teatime the members were back in conclave. Included in their running order for Thursday was a motion to strike the Guerin report from the Dáil record. The report, commissioned by Enda Kenny’s government in 2014, found that then justice minister Alan Shatter mishandled Garda misconduct allegations. The unsinkable Shatter embarked on a successful legal campaign to clear his name, and a Supreme Court ruling sealed it.The motion to remove the report from the Dáil library was tabled at the behest of the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle in light of the judgment. The Business Committee agreed it would be taken without debate. Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh was firmly against the move but he was outvoted. ReservationsWhen it came up for mention on the floor of the Dáil on Wednesday, the TD for Dublin South Central expressed his reservations again. This time he got a torrent of support, and when the time came for TDs to rubberstamp the committee’s Thursday schedule (including the now heavily questioned Shatter motion) they voted to scrap it.The long-suffering Ceann Comhairle sighed heavily, and called an urgent meeting of his Business Committee for later in the afternoon, otherwise there would be nothing to do or talk about the next day. If he was looking in, Shatter, a controversial figure when he was minister, must have been feeling very hard done by. Are his erstwhile parliamentary peers so bitter they would rather overlook a Supreme Court judgment than allow him justice in parliament and an admission that he was right? (A concept Shatter never had any difficulty with himself throughout a long political career.)But this was nothing personal. It wasn’t about Alan. It was to do with procedure and precedent.“I don’t have any problem with the court judgment in relation to the Sean Guerin report. People might recall what that is – it was a vindication of former deputy Shatter,” explained Ó Snodaigh, who, while never the former minister’s biggest fan, was not trying to do him down.Un-lay an eggBut, as Brendan Howlin so delicately put it: “You can no more un-lay a report than a hen can un-lay an egg.” What’s this got to do with eggs?Did Shatter lay an egg along with everything else? Is there no end to the man’s talent?No. Varadkar laid the un-laying egg out of the blue, and then the Ceann Comhairle agreed to sit on it. Deputies were very surprised when they found out. They were taken aback, and expressed concern about this very unnatural idea of un-laying something which has already been laid in front of them. Then there was the whole other story of trying to pass a motion while reversing the laying process.Can it be done at all, wondered TDs on all sides? They demanded more time to work it out. It would be an unconscionable strain on the democratic process otherwise.The Ceann Comhairle moved to soothe ruffled feathers. “Our legal advice is that the motion before the House can un-lay the laid report. I know you can’t put the egg back after it’s been laid,” clucked Seán O’Fearghaíl, looking a bit broody after the Business Committee’s best laid plans were lying on the chamber floor in smithereens, like Humpty Dumpty.Legal adviceÓ Snodaigh said the committee had no legal advice regarding the motion, and there seemed no reason or justification for this sudden urge to rush through the un-laying of the Shatter egg. Withdrawing a report from the Oireachtas library has never happened before, he continued. Furthermore, the act requires the involvement of the Seanad, which currently only exists in the form of an unfertilised egg and won’t be pushed out anywhere until a new government is formed.“So I think we are being previous on this,” concluded Aengus, to the general agreement of all but the few Fine Gael TDs present.Social Democrat Catherine Murphy talked about the “specific” and the “general”. The majority of Deputies have no issue with the specific case involving the unlaying of the Shatter-shaped egg but “it’s the consequences or the unintended consequences that could follow on from doing this” which were causing concern. Government chief whip Peter Burke stressed “natural justice” should not be denied any former member of the Dáil. “This issue was discussed at the Business Committee and has been in gestation for a while.”Sticking his beak inMeanwhile, one of Shatter’s successors in Justice flapped into the chamber. Charlie Flanagan was like a hen on a hot griddle, anxious to stick his beak in. The motion was fully in order, and he took exception to Catherine Murphy’s remarks about “unintended consequences” when it was simply addressing the “result of misrepresentation, innuendo and debate of some years ago”. Her “further accusations” were unfounded. Murphy, nonplussed, repeated she has no issue with removing the Guerin report, but just wants to be sure it does not spark attempts to have other reports removed from the record. “What are the unintended consequences? Everything is a conspiracy for you,” roared the Minister. She told him TDs merely wanted to make sure things are done right from a legal perspective.But there was no convincing Charlie. “It’s a daily conspiracy,” he squawked, politically distancing himself from the Social Democrat’s co-leader.The House agreed by a large majority to reject Thursday’s timetable and the motion was thrown out, for now.It’ll be back though. Sure as eggs is eggs."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4245603.1588691314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what was the food culture in ireland before the potato","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA 16th century brewhouse  at the Weald and Downland museum in West Suxxex. “We want to understand how stone masons could drink 14 pints of beer and build cathedrals”A five-year inter-disciplinary study into the diet and eating habits of Irish communities in the 16th and 17th century aims to bust some myths about the Irish being an inward-looking people while shedding light on a period of history not well researched in terms of its food.The European Research Council-funded Food Cult project brings together history, archaeology, science and information technology researchers whose knowledge and skills will be combined to test theories and analyse data about what people in Ireland ate from 1550 to 1650.“We will be asking questions like was there a food culture in Ireland before the potato? What was the impact of war on diet? Did the lower classes eat as the elite said they did?” says Dr Susan Flavin, associate professor of early modern history at Trinity College Dublin. Flavin is the lead researcher on the €1.5 million funded Food Cult project (foodcult.eu) whose partner institutions are University College Dublin, the Institute of Technology in Sligo, Maynooth University and the University of Bristol, the University of Durham in the UK.“We want to understand what and when people ate certain foods, and how they developed their identities through it. We want to look at the impact of globalisation on the Irish diet, or how new ideas about manners or health or religion (eg the demise of the Lenten fast after the Reformation) changed the diet of Irish communities. “We know there was trade from France and Spain with the west of Ireland, but the Gaelic Irish didn’t keep records of this,” Flavin adds. Using food as a way of exploring the past is in itself a new research area, but what marks out this project is the cross-referencing of knowledge and data that will be used to find out more about how people lived in this period. So, for example, the household records of Dublin Castle or Christchurch Cathedral will be used to understand what foods were purchased for consumption. These historical records will be cross-referenced with molecular analysis of human skeletons (andor teeth) and animal bones, and chemical analysis of pots from the period to discover who ate which foods. “We want to understand if dairy was more important than meat by analysing the animal bones to see if the cattle were dry stock or dairy. We want to understand how stone masons could drink 14 pints of beer and build cathedrals,” adds Dr Meriel McClatchie, associate professor of archaeology and director of the Ancient Food Research Group at UCD. Nutrition Beer was a source of nutrition across Europe in the 16th and 17th century. Historical records show that English soldiers were allocated eight pints of beer a day, while those doing manual labour were allocated 14 pints of beer a day. Meanwhile, Prof Janet Montgomery from the archaeology department at Durham University will do chemical analysis of different skeletal remains to identify different concentrations of alcohol at different locations. The Food Cult researchers are also interested in finding out if the daily diet varied depending on whether people lived in coastal or inland parts of Ireland. “There was an influx of people into Ireland during the Elizabethan colonisation, so we want to find out about the impact of Irish diet on English practices as well,” says Flavin. How children were fed in this period is another area of potential discovery. During this period, she adds, elite groups wanted to distinguish themselves from the peasants, and food was one of the ways to do so. “Historical records point to these elite groups eating ‘white foods’ which included all kinds of domesticated fowl and wild birds,” she says. Seeds and shells New scientific techniques can now identify and date seeds from fruits, the shells from nuts and different cereal grains. And researchers at McClatchie’s archeobotany laboratory at UCD will collate research on these foods from previous excavations. Environmental archaeologist Dr Ellen O’Carroll will create the Food Cult project’s dietary map of everything that links different communities to what they ate during the period. “We will be able to extract information on hops, barley, cooking pots, knives, clay pipes and plot this information all over Ireland,” she says. This data, which will be drawn from thousands of archaeological digs carried out in Ireland over the past 20 years, will then be statistically analysed by Prof Andrew Parnell from the department of mathematics and statistics and Maynooth University. He will search for new patterns in diet and eating habits which – the researchers hope – will bring new knowledge about food history. The database, and results, will be available to future researchers once the project is complete. “Researchers will be able to look at what people were eating in Thurles in the 17th century, what pots they used and what foods they cooked, look at comparisons with neighbouring counties, and understand the extent of new forms of consumption across Ireland,” says McClatchie.

Tolga AkmenGettyAFPThe coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organisation said on Wednesday, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a “massive effort” to counter it.“It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan told an online briefing.“I think it is important we are realistic and I don’t think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,” he added. “I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be.”However, he said the world had some control over how it coped with the disease, although this would take a “massive effort” even if a vaccine was found a prospect he described as a “massive moonshot”.More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including several in clinical trials, but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses.Ryan noted that vaccines exist for other illnesses, such as measles, that have not been eliminated.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: “The trajectory is in our hands, and it’s everybody’s business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic.”Ryan said “very significant control” of the virus was required in order to lower the assessment of risk, which he said remained high at the “national, regional and global levels”.It comes as the United Nations is forecasting the coronavirus pandemic will shrink the world economy by 3.2 per cent this year, the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression in the 1930s.The UN’s mid-year report said Covid-19 is expected to slash global economic output by nearly $8.5 trillion (€7.9 trillion) over the next two years, wiping out nearly all gains of the last four years. In January, the UN forecast modest growth of 2.5 per cent in 2020.Coronavirus has infected more than 4.3 million people and killed more than 294,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.Here are the latest updates on the pandemic from around the world:ITALYItaly’s German-speaking region South Tyrol has defied Rome by easing lockdown restrictions quicker than in the rest of the country.Spurred by economic pressure, the provincial governor defied Rome this week and reasserted South Tyrol’s cherished autonomy, allowing restaurants, hair salons, tattoo parlours and museums to reopen on Monday well ahead of the timetable set by Italy’s government.“We have a relatively positive situation regarding the epidemic, with a rate of contagion the lowest in Italy,” said governor Arno Kompatscher, whose South Tyrolean People’s Party has controlled the province since 1948.South Tyroleans sat in Walther Square, near Bolzano’s Duomo, and ate lunch at the prescribed two metre distance or drank coffee in bars outfitted with Plexiglas safety screens.Despite the province’s bold stance, some business owners demurred to Rome for now.\u0026nbspSouth Tyrol reported no new confirmed virus cases on Tuesday.The province so far has 2,572 confirmed cases with 290 deaths, both figures representing about 1 per cent of Italy’s totals.\u0026nbspItaly has recorded 31,106 deaths from coronavirus, based on the latest figures.FRANCEFrance’s daily death toll from the new coronavirus dropped on Wednesday to 83 from 348 the day before, bringing the total number of dead there to 27,074 and putting it just behind Spain in terms of overall fatalities from the disease.Three days after ending a 55-day lockdown, the number of additional confirmed cases was also lower than on Tuesday, easing fears of a new wave of infections.France briefly overtook Spain on Tuesday as the country with the world’s fourth-highest number of COVID-19 fatalities, but its southern neighbour earlier on Wednesday reported that its death toll had risen overnight to 27,104.CHINAChina has reported seven new coronavirus cases. Six of them were in the north-eastern province of Jilin where authorities have raised alert levels and suspended rail connections to one county where a cluster of unknown origin has appeared over recent days.Another 754 people are in treatment for suspected cases or for having tested positive but not shown symptoms, while 104 people are in hospital undergoing treatment.China has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,926 cases.On Tuesday, local media reported the government would conduct tests on all 11 million residents of Wuhan, the central industrial city where the virus was first detected late last year.SPAINSpain’s daily death toll from the coronavirus inched up on Wednesday to 184 fatalities from 176 on Tuesday, the country’s health ministry said.The overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,104, while the overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 228,691 from 228,030 the prior day.Spanish authorities are planning to keep borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July, two foreign ministry sources said on Wednesday, in a move to try and avoid a second wave of contagion from the coronavirus.Land borders with France and Portugal have been closed since a state of emergency was declared in mid-March to fight the pandemic, pushing the economy to a near stand-still and hitting its tourism sector hard.Spain has started easing the lockdown for its residents as the pandemic gets under control. But it also imposed a two-week quarantine for foreign travellers and practically shut the border to air and maritime travel to avoid importing new cases from other countries.The quarantine measure is due to expire on May 24th when the state of emergency lapses, but both can be extended. In any case, restrictions on travel are likely to remain in place for much longer than May 24th, no matter how crucial tourism is for the Spanish economy, the sources told Reuters.To prevent triggering a new wave of infections being imported by travellers from abroad, the government is studying ways of controlling who can enter the country.Part of the holiday season could still be saved by tourists from Schengen countries, the source added.Spain’s tourism industry draws some 80 million annual visitors and accounts for around 12 per cent of gross domestic product in the world’s second most visited country.GERMANYThe country plans to start loosening border controls this weekend after two months of restrictions.Interior minister Horst Seehofer said checks on the border with Luxembourg will be dropped after Friday. On the borders with France, Switzerland and Austria, all crossings will be opened — rather than selected ones at present — and authorities will switch to spot rather than systematic checks.Mr Seehofer said the aim is to restore free travel across those three borders on June 15th, so long as coronavirus infection rates allow.Germany imposed checks on its borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Denmark on March 16th and people “without a valid reason to travel” have not been allowed to cross.Eastern neighbours Poland and the Czech Republic closed their own borders. Mr Seehofer said Germany is prepared to relax controls on the Danish border, but Denmark is in the process of consulting its other neighboursLESOTHOThe tiny African mountain kingdom has confirmed its first positive case of Covid-19, making it the last of 54 African countries to report the disease.The health ministry said one person, who had recently arrived in the country, had tested positive without showing signs of illness.The patient is isolated. Lesotho, a country of two million people, is surrounded by South Africa, which has the highest confirmed cases in Africa at 11,350.RUSSIARussia on Wednesday reported 10,028 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, pushing its nationwide tally to 242,271.Russia’s coronavirus response centre said 96 people died overnight, bringing the official death toll to 2,212.Russia has suspended the use of Russian-made medical ventilators of a certain model manufactured after April 1st, a state healthcare regulator said on Wednesday, following two hospital fires reported to involve two such machines.The Aventa-M medical ventilator was used at the Saint George’s Hospital in St Petersburg where five people died in a fire on Tuesday, and also in a hospital in Moscow where a fire killed one person on Saturday.Roszdravnadzor, the regulator, said on Tuesday it was checking the quality and safety of the ventilators in the two hospitals.AUSTRIAAustrian authorities said the country’s border with Germany will reopen fully next month.The Austria Press Agency reported that the chancellery in Vienna said the border will be open completely on June 15th and that checks will be reduced, starting on Friday.It said Austria is aiming for similar agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and its eastern neighbours.Austria has been pressing for a reopening of some borders in the hope of attracting tourists to the country this summer.NEW ZEALANDNew Zealand reported no new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday, the second day in a row without any and the fourth such day since early last week.Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said it was encouraging news as the country prepares to ease many of its lockdown restrictions. Most businesses, including shopping centres, retail stores and restaurants, will be able to reopen. Social distancing rules will remain in place and gatherings will be limited to 10 people.POLANDPoland will extend its strict border controls until June 12th due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.Polish citizens, diplomats, foreigners with the legal right to live in Poland and foreign professional drivers can enter Poland at selected checkpoints.While keeping borders closed, Poland is easing some other curbs imposed earlier. It has reopened shopping malls, hotels, outdoor playgrounds and allowed kindergartens to restart.The government is expected to announce on Wednesday the lifting of further restrictions on schools, restaurants and hairdressers.Poland now has 17,062 confirmed coronavirus cases and 847 deaths. On Tuesday, the country saw its largest spike in new coronavirus cases in one day due to a rapid growth in infections among coal miners.BRAZILBrazil’s confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus passed Germany on Tuesday, as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro fought states over his wish to reopen gyms and beauty parlors even as his country becomes a new global hotspot for the pandemic.Brazil has confirmed 177,589 cases since its outbreak began in late February, passing Germany’s 170,508 confirmed cases and drawing nearly even with France’s tally of 178,225 confirmed and probable cases.Europe is beginning to lift lockdowns as the death toll in the region eases, but the outbreak is still accelerating in Brazil, where Bolsonaro has played down the risks of the disease and criticized state governments’ isolation orders.Brazil recorded its deadliest day yet, with 881 confirmed deaths in 24 hours from the Covid-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus.SOUTH KOREASouth Korea said it has no immediate plans to revive strict social distancing rules despite a spike in coronavirus cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul.Vice health minister Kim Gang-lip said the government needs more time to analyse details of recent outbreaks before determining whether to maintain relaxed social distancing guidelines.South Korea eased up on much of its strict social distancing rules last week before it had about roughly 30 new cases each day in the past few days. On Wednesday, South Korea recorded 26 new cases, 20 of them associated with clubs in Seoul’s Itaewon entertainment district.Health officials said in principle they would maintain relaxed social distancing rules if the country’s daily jump is below 50 and the number of untraceable cases account for less than 5 per cent of all confirmed cases. – PAReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"one sided view empire no way understand britains past","story":"Nothing better illustrates how moral perceptions change over time than Britons’ view of their erstwhile empire. When prime minister Benjamin Disraeli arranged for Queen Victoria to become Empress of India in 1877, he could not have flattered his monarch more yet today “imperialism” is used almost exclusively as a pejorative. I don’t think that it’s sufficient for us today simply to assume that we are morally superior to our ancestors (still less that we have achieved moral perfection). We need to understand how people at the time believed that they were doing good, as they created the world’s largest ever empire.A population that had been brought up studying the history of Rome did not think empires bad. The Romans had “civilised” Europe, spreading their literature, architecture and civil engineering. The emperors had latterly become Christian and when Rome was at last overrun by “barbarians”, a long “Dark Age” followed. Such thinking may have influenced those who saw a need to convert other people to Christianity.“We seem … to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind,” wrote a historian at the end of the 19th century. There is much truth in that, although the English took some deliberate steps, such as when Elizabeth I, in 1583, granted Walter Raleigh a charter to found a colony (Virginia), or when Oliver Cromwell’s navy seized Jamaica from Spain in 1655. But Massachusetts was founded not by government but by religious refugees, while the colonisation of Canada and India was driven forward by private companies and Australia developed, accidentally, from penal colonies.Having grabbed Jamaica, England lacked the means to defend it and recruited pirates for the task. From Port Royal, the “privateers” set out to plunder Spanish ships. Given Great Britain’s weakness, it was a diplomatic coup in 1670 to wring from Spain recognition of its Caribbean and Atlantic colonies in return for suppressing piracy.The island required a new economic activity. The climate was ideal for sugar but deemed too harsh for white workers, so enslaved people were brought from West Africa to Jamaica (and Virginia too). In the seventeenth century, few people regarded slavery as a moral issue. It had been practised during all of history. Africans had enslaved other Africans. Barbary pirates had seized white Christians. Arab traders had systematically plundered Africa for slaves.However, the European powers enslaved Africans on an industrial scale. According to one estimate, the British shipped 3.4 million people to its colonies, second only to Portugal, out of a total of more than 12 million seized and transported across the Atlantic during the 16th and 19th centuries. The Caribbean islands were, for some time, Britain’s most prized colonies, and the profits helped to launch the industrial revolution.Britain suffered one of its worst humiliations with the loss of its 13 colonies that declared independence in 1776 and became the United States. Americans had established impressive representative systems of government (the Virginia General Assembly has been making laws since 1619), and they had developed a creed of liberty that drew on British political philosophers. The revolutionaries rejected not only Crown misrule but monarchy and aristocracy.Many Americans who opposed the revolution headed across the northern border and subsequent waves of immigrants from the British Isles into Canada established it as a monarchist stronghold. After the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807, and slavery from 1834, British Canada represented a moral rebuke to the US, where human bondage continued.The British in southern Africa fell victim to colossal greed. Both they, and the earlier Dutch settlers, known as Boers, regarded the lands as uninhabited, whereas in fact they were seized from indigenous peoples. The British battled first the Zulus and then the Boers, when gold was found in their settlements. Our resort to concentration camps to hem in the indigenous and Boer populations, with massive loss of life, remains one of the most disgraceful episodes in our history. Perhaps weakened by shame, after that war the British negotiated with the Boers a constitution for South Africa that segregated the populations on racial lines and granted to blacks only a tiny portion of the land. The origins of Apartheid clearly lie in the British colonial period.India was described by the British as the jewel in the imperial crown. That was not just because of its fabulous wealth, much of which was exported by the British East India Company or purloined by its corrupt managers. It was in India that Britain established the most perfect form of empire.After the Indian rebellion of 1857 the East India Company was sacked. The second sons of great families who thereafter went to administer the Raj dedicated their lives to the place, as did those of lesser rank who managed railways, post offices or settled as missionaries. You can argue that the ministries and railways were created so that a tiny number of whites could control a vast population of brown-skinned people. Undoubtedly so. However, those measures unified hundreds of ethnic groups and so created India (which then included Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma). Peoples who spoke thousands of different languages acquired a common tongue: English. It is telling that Gandhi depended on the British-built railways to spread the message of independence, spoke in English, and employed his mastery of English law to embarrass the Raj.In the 21st century, we rightly condemn imperialism (and there remain plenty of current examples). The British began to repent long ago, leading the world away from slavery and closing down the rapacious East India Company. But it is important to understand that much that was done in the name of empire was regarded at the time as laudable, not wicked: it is important because, otherwise, we may think that we today have achieved “virtue”, whereas our values will surely prove as transitory as our ancestors’.“Portillo’s Empire Journey” starts on Channel 5 from this Friday at 9pmMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rihanna supplants british stars music rich list london move","story":"Rihanna could become Britain\u0027s first billionaire musician as she enters Rich List above Sir Elton John after moving to UKThe Barbadian singer relocated to London in 2019 and has already joined the knighted and lordly company of established UK stars in the ranking of riches. Sir Elton has been immediately overtaken by the incoming £468 million fortune of the 32-year-old, who took third place from Irish rock band U2.Only master of musicals Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber and second-placed pop veteran Sir Paul McCartney have greater wealth.Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty in Bridgetown, Barbados, the singer achieved widespread fame and numerous number ones after moving to the US in 2005.  Her self-titled fashion line Fenty has bolstered her fortune, which could grow to billions of pounds, and her move to the UK was motivated by her being closer to designers.She has already surpassed the more established British figures like Sir Mick Jagger and Sir Rod Stewart on the Sunday Times musicians\u0027 rich list.Rihanna typifies the seismic change we\u0027ve seen in the Rich List in recent years, said compiler Robert Watts Once dominated by inherited wealth, the bulk of our 1,000 entries are now self-made people with modest and even troubled starts in life who are driven to work exceptionally hard.Still only 32, if Rihanna remains based in the UK she could well pip Sir Paul McCartney and Lord Lloyd Webber to be the Sunday Times Rich List\u0027s first billionaire musician.”Lord Lloyd Webber remains top with £820 million to his name, despite an expected £20 million hit to his fortune due to coronavirus closing theatres.  Sir Elton’s farewell tour helped him to £360 million and fourth place behind the new arrival, with Rolling Stone Sir Mick in fifth place with £285 million.Olivia and Dhani Harrison, the widow and son of George Harrison, share the sixth spot with Keith Richards, enjoying fortunes of £270 million.Ed Sheeran, the youngest on the list at just 29, shares the 10th spot with Sir Rod and Sting.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fbi accidentally names saudi diplomat suspects having links","story":"The FBI has accidentally identified a Saudi diplomat whom they believe had links to the terrorists behind the September 11 attacks, confirming for the first time that US authorities suspected Riyadh’s Washington embassy was involved in the atrocity.In a court filing responding to the families of September 11 victims, who claim in a lawsuit that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the attacks, the FBI apparently forgot to blank out a reference to Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah.Mr Jarrah was assigned to Saudi Arabia’s Washington embassy from 1999-2000 in Washington DC, and the US authorities believe that he oversaw assistance given to two al-Qaeda terrorists as they settled in the US before the attack.The two al-Qaeda members, Khalid Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Al-Hazmi, went on to hijack an American Airlines plane and kill 125 people after crashing into the Pentagon building.It is the first time that the FBI has publicly confirmed that it suspects a link between the Saudi embassy in Washington and the September 11 hijackers.The court document was filed by Jill Sanborn, the assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism ision, and was alluding to findings in a heavily redacted FBI report when it mentioned Mr Jarrah.  The 2012 report identified two other Saudi men, Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi, who were suspected of assisting the hijackers, but it did not name Mr Jarrah, whom the FBI suspects was the “the third man involved.US investigators believed that Mr Bayoumi was a Saudi intelligence agent -

My second thought went along the lines of “who-the-hell-are-you-to-crush-our-collective-hopes-of-blue-skies-and-Magnums-on-a-Costa?”On the evidence of his peevish podium performances a lot of us had already guessed the Health and Social Care Secretary lacks the empathy gene. Now we have cast-iron proof that Hancock-up is also afflicted by Type 2 pomposity, degenerative officiousness and, above all, a tin ear. Has the man no soul? Or just no idea? Package deals, boutique hotels, city breaks – these are what the British live for.Particularly the womenfolk. A full 88 per cent of us take the lead in organising the couple’s getaway or family holiday. Why? Because, in this regard, most men are at sea we alone know exactly what everyone in the household needs. A break. A change of air and dynamics and routine. It is this delayed gratification, this dizzy prospect of going somewhere else, just for a week, a fortnight, that enables us to keep calm and carry on at the best of times.Here, in what are the worst of times, trips to new parks, illicit picnics and schlepping toddlers on long car journeys to wave at grandparents through conservatory windows have become crucial stepping stones, the pleasurable punctuations guiding us through the drudgery of daily life.I think we can all agree that nobody should be whisking their family off to Covid-free Kiribati, recklessly shedding the virus like Gaugin passing round syphilis on Tahiti. But by the summer, parts of Europe, such as France, will be happy to have us. Perceived lavishness when we arrive remains in the eye of the beholder. But is the Government really saying that if and when international flights resume in earnest, we’re not allowed to take them? Unless Dominic Raab is willing to patrol Heathrow departures with a team of iels trained to detect contraband sarongs, I’m not sure how anyone can stop us.What is truly exasperating is that, despite his Cabinet brief, Matt Hancock seems to have a pitiful grasp of mental health and how to maintain it. Clue: isolation and staying indoors may safeguard us physically, but there’s real harm being done to our heads. Holidays are not a luxury. They are a necessity. In the current coronavirus climate they are the beacon of light at the end of the (Channel) tunnel, the Brenner Pass, the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg Wildlife Corridor.Hancock bossily telling us on television that they aren’t going to happen has hit public morale right in the solar apoplexus. Which is to say: we are furious. Maybe holidays could be rebranded as Mental Health Retreats? Would self-care sanctuaries chime better with the insistence on nanny state joylessness?The British public are not stupid. We understand that whole countries are in a state of flux and that the holiday we planned may not be possible. If that is so, we will improvise, but we will make it happen if we can.What we will not accept are peremptory lectures from a government minister slapping us down like children for daring to dream. In truth, Matt Hancock appears so socially distanced from common sense, he could probably do with a holiday.I suggest his wife goes ahead and books one.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"obstructive public officials could sorely use dose private sector","story":"At the supermarkets, one-way systems keep us all safely a few feet apart. The garden centres have closed their coffee shops and are using the space for collections instead. Marketing agencies, law firms, engineers and accountants have all started to find ways of mixing home and office working, even if it means taking the occasional shortcut. My local Indian is doing fantastic takeaways, and so is the pub, while my daughter’s prep school has cut its fees and is running home classes, even including chapel.Over the last few weeks, the private sector has adapted to a world in which a highly infectious, though not usually lethal, virus may be around for a long time. There’s one problem, however. The public sector is fighting change tooth and nail and, even where it is willing to adapt, it is holding both the Government and public to ransom by demanding ever-higher wages.As the UK economy faces up to its greatest crisis in three hundred years we are re-learning with a vengeance that the biggest strength of a free market is its ability to cope with uniquely challenging situations – and the biggest weakness of the public sector is its refusal either to change or to listen to its customers.There are many different ways in which private businesses are starting to create a socially distanced economy. Food production has been redesigned for a world without restaurants. Work is being done from home. Meetings are shifting online. Retailers are turning into home delivery companies, and tech start-ups are pivoting towards healthcare, wellbeing and home entertainment.All of this is happening in the blink of an eye. No doubt those companies would prefer not to be doing any of that. Few of us especially enjoy change. But until we have an effective vaccine or cure for Covid-19 there isn’t much choice. With every day that passes, however, the contrast with the public sector is becoming more and more painful.Teaching unions are virtually refusing to re-open schools, and are resisting moves towards online lessons, even though it means children will fall behind with their learning, and without the schools the rest of the economy can scarcely function. The transport unions are resisting redesigning train and tube travel to keep systems safe and operational, even though there is no way of re-starting production if people cannot get to work.We all salute the work of medics and care home workers, but in a year when the living wage has already been increased by three times the rate of inflation it is not obvious that pay rises are as much of a priority as the health unions seem to think they are.Meanwhile, Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, is demanding a bigger and bigger role for her shop stewards in policing whether a workplace is “safe” or not. Very soon we may have re-created a 1970s economy in which swaggering, power-hungry unions control every aspect of production, entirely for their own benefit, and with zero regard for their customers.Things were not like this during World War II, probably the only comparable national emergency of the last century. On the whole, the trade unions were wholehearted supporters of the war effort, switching the economy towards the manufacture of munitions and supplies, and improvising to keep factories open. No one downed their tools half way through the latest batch of Spitfires in an argument over health and safety.True, perhaps Churchill’s government of national unity, which bought in union leaders such as Ernest Bevin as Minister for Labour, helped. There might be a case for something similar as this crisis unfolds (although it is, to put it mildly, quite a leap to imagine Len McCluskey becoming the new Bevin).At present it is hard to see this happening. It seems far more likely that the unions will not be on the side of getting the economy working again, and nor will a Labour Party still dominated by public sector workers despite its new, supposedly moderate leadership.As ever, the private sector will adapt, change and evolve – but it would be a heck of a lot easier to weather this crisis if the public sector had just a slither of the same “can-do” spirit.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools start opening amid covid 19 children nothing","story":"Around the world school gates are reopening after months of lockdown which left playgrounds empty and classrooms forlorn.But where there were once excited shouts as children arrived for a new day, there are now instructions to keep your distance and regularly wash your hands.As children return to class in countries that have begun to ease their lockdown measures, new school regimes have been introduced to minimise the risk of renewed infections leading to a second wave of Covid-19.How countries manage the return of pupils is being watched closely in Britain, where the Government has asked primary schools to reopen on June 1 for reception, Year 1 and Year 6.Parisian nursery teacher Dominique Sicard has been pouring over a 57-page protocol from the French education ministry on how to respect social distancing with a class of five-year olds and is categorical.“If the people who govern us think we can respect all this to the letter, there’s no point in re-opening at all,” said the 53-year-old.“I’ve already warned parents that while children will have a table and chair with their name on, it is impossible for them to remain at that desk all day. Most are happy with it.”As France slowly re-emerges from two months of confinement, the Ecole des Trois Bornes in Paris is one of tens of thousands of the country’s nursery and primary schools opening its doors to around 1.5 million pupils this week, roughly a quarter of the total.While nursery and primary schools in France’s “green”low-infection areas began classes on Tuesday, those in Paris - deep red given ongoing contagion levels - only start widening intake beyond the offspring of essential critical workers on Thursday.Among a long list of sanitary measures, teachers must wear face masks and the children\u0027s chairs be separated to avoid spreading the disease.One Ms Sicard and colleagues have already written off is to coop children inside a metre-square enclosure in the playground far from their classmates.“It’s inhuman and impossible. Five-year-olds need to be able to run around and let off steam otherwise they lose the plot,” she said.Pupils are not supposed to touch teachers and vice versa. “But what about a child that hurts itself and requires treatment, can’t hang its coat up or goes to the toilet and can’t do its trousers up?,” she asked.“We can’t turn them into adults just because the context dictates they should act as adults. If they see their friends, they’ll want to go and play with them,” she said.That said, she said many of the rules will be applied, including disinfecting toys and surfaces.Despite her reservations, she said she approved of France re-opening schools in particular out of “solidarity for families whose parents have to work”.Paris’ town hall expects 600 of its 652 primary and nursery schools to open this week to welcome a quarter of its 130,000 pupils. Nation-wide, most will re-open but classes will be small - a maximum of 10 in nursery schools and 15 in elementary schools.“There are more risks in staying home than going to school,” insisted education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer.The return to school is on a voluntary basis and the vast majority of children remain at home. Teachers are supposed to juggle with real and remote teaching.Secondary school children are not due back until May 25.Unions have criticised the decision to reopen the schools calling it “premature and pointing out that the government overruled its scientific committee’s advice to keep them shut until September, like the UK.Why have we started with the youngest children to end the lockdown when we know they\u0027ll be the hardest ones to make apply protective measures? said Francette Popineau, chief of the primary school union, on FranceInfo radio.Parents have mixed feelings. Bruno Timsit, 41, is keeping his three children away from nursery, primary and secondary school for now.“It wasn’t an easy decision but we decided there is no rush. We weren’t sure how schools were going to cope and were a bit worried about the kids contaminating each other and us,” he said.“I also with the idea of leaving it to parents to decide whether to take risk of sending they kids back to school. The government should have taken responsibility and either called everyone back or no.”However, Tarek Elachkar, 45, said he “decided to trust the official guidelines”. His nine-year old daughter Olivia will return to primary school on Thursday.“She misses school. We tried to tell her it would be different but she said she was happy to go back. That nailed it for us,” he said.Nursery headmistress Pascale Chartier said she was not worried about infections. “We have been looking after children of high-risk health workers throughout the confinement period and have had no infections of teachers or pupils,” she said. Studies suggests transmission from children under 10 is very low.“We are being careful but we are confident it will be alright,” she said.Dutch parents have been instructed to ‘kiss and go’ at the school gates, as primary children in the Netherlands began a staggered return this week.It would be normal for parents in primary school to take their kids into the classroom in the morning. But most schools are now asking parents to drop their children at the school gates or at the doors and stay out of the premises to minimise the risk of spreading infection.Audrey Verschuren, principal of the Leonardo Da Vinci school in Amsterdam, which admits half its children in the morning and half in the afternoon, said: “The parents have had to get used to it. It\u0027s a bit nerve-wracking for them to see their four-year-old child who has been with us for just two months walk into the classroom on their own! But children get used to new situations quickly and always find the fun side.Each school has come up with its own solution to keep the required 1.5m distance between staff and pupils.Ribbons mark out one-way routes and there are separate entrances for different age groups. Older or vulnerable teachers do not have to return to work, while some schools have taped off a ‘safe area’ for teachers at the front of the class, while children sit at a greater distance at their desks and play outside in their half-class groups. Some parents are still anxious. At the British School of Amsterdam a third have kept their children at home.But Paul Morgan, the schools’ Principal, told The  of the joy of welcoming back those who came.“It has been so heart-warming to see the children back in school: smiling and enjoying seeing their teachers and friends again,” he said.Denmark pioneered the start of the European return to school from May 4 by keeping its primary school children in small groups and with as little contact with others as possible.These micro-groups arrive at a separate time, eat lunch separately, have their own zones in the playground and are taught by one teacher.Dom Maher, head of the international section of St Josef\u0027s school in Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, said: There was anxiety in the community. A large percentage of parents were in two minds.But the Danish experiment appears to have been a success, so much so that the insistence on children washing their hands frequently has led to problems with skin irritation and eczema.Schools began to reopen in Germany last month, but parents and teachers have voiced frustration with measures to contain the virus.Most schools have reduced class sizes so social distancing can be observed, but many can only achieve this by iding classes and teaching children on alternate days. “It’s an absolute farce,” one parent in Berlin said, complaining that her child will only get four days of lessons before the summer holidays under the new timetable.Many parents say employers expect them to be able come back to work because the schools are open and don’t realise they’re still stuck taking care of their children three days a week.Pupils are expected to wear facemasks while entering and leaving but most schools allow them to be removed in the classroom.One school in a remote part of north-eastern Germany has won plaudits for coming up with an alternative solution. Henry Tesch, headmaster of the Carolinum School in Neutsrelitz, says iding classes and teaching on alternate days isn’t an option because of the long distances his pupils have to travel, with some travelling as far as 40 miles each way.So the school is offering coronavirus tests to pupils twice a week, in partnership with a local company.Switzerland has taken a radical approach to reopening schools because its government is convinced children are not at risk from the virus.Swiss authorities recently announced it was safe for grandparents to hug their grandchildren and they have taken the same attitude to reopening schools. “Young children very rarely get infected and transmit the virus to others even less,” Alain Berset, the Swiss interior minister said.Primary and secondary schools were allowed to reopen this week and in most regions they are teaching full classes as usual.A notable exception is Zurich, where classes have been ided in two to prevent overcrowding.Regions have been given considerable autonomy in deciding what measures to take.Authorities in Basel said iding classes “would not solve the problem of childcare for families and would pose additional challenges for teachers”. But there has been resistance to the government advice in areas which have been harder hit by the virus.In Taiwan, which has avoided a lockdown due to its successful pandemic strategy, schools were closed for the month of February, but have since functioned in a relatively normal fashion with some social distancing restrictions.Children have had to wear masks in disinfected classrooms, sit at least 70cm apart and wash their hands after every break. School assemblies were restricted and parents were not permitted to attend sports days but activities like swimming lessons have now resumed.Fergus Meiklejohn, a British filmmaker who lives in Taipei with his wife and two primary school age daughters, said: “For us parents we are happy that the school and government are doing their best. If we had the infection rates currently in the UK, we’d still be scared kids would bring infection back to the family even with these precautions.”.  Sean Kramer, an American teacher based in Taiwan, said: “Kids will be kids and interact with each other, their lives haven’t changed that much. But the school won’t take any chances if a student has a temperature. I’ve had noticeably more absences in my classes this semester.”China - where the coronavirus pandemic began - has been reopening its schools cautiously and in phases, running classes with a maximum of 20 pupils to allow children to sit a safe distance from each other. Some schools are even using video calls so that teachers can instruct classes from a separate room.Students now have shorter lessons and have been told to avoid public transport to and from school.In Hangzhou, children at one elementary school made their own bespoke “social-distancing” hats with metre-long wings to remind them to help them avoid getting too close to each other.In Greece, students in the final year of high school returned to school on Monday, with all other high school students, as well as middle school pupils, going back next week.Each class is limited to 15 to ensure social distancing regulations and break times will be staggered so classes.Schools are livestreaming classes so that they can rotate student attendance and keep classrooms at 50 per cent capacity or below.That decision has been criticised by a national teachers\u0027 union, which says it could infringe on children\u0027s privacy rights.By swiftly implementing a national lockdown, Greece managed to contain its coronavirus outbreak. So far the death toll is just 151 – compared with more than 30,000 in nearby Italy. Around 2,700 people have been infected.Austria was one of the first countries in Europe to lift its lockdown but it is taking a cautious approach to reopening schools.Classes resumed on May 4 for those facing school leaving exams, but for others they do not resume until May 18. Sixth formers who do not have exams will have to wait until June 3.Austria has formalised the practice of iding classes to limit numbers with a clear and simple system to be used across the country.All classes will be ided in two, with one half attending lessons from Monday to Wednesday, and the other on Thursday and Friday. Each week the two groups will swap over, so all children get the same number of lessons.Austria has also taken steps to get round the problem of childcare for parents returning to work.On the days they do not have lessons children will be able to study under supervision in school gyms, if parents wish.Facemasks will be compulsory while moving around the school but not in classrooms. Schools will be issued with “emergency masks” for pupils who forget to bring theirs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/27/16/sunak-crop.jpg","title":"furlough workers wage support rishi sunak announcement","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.As chancellor announces employers will have to start contributing to furloughed workers’ pay, employees are left with uncertainty about\u0026nbspfutureSome aspects of being on furlough have been pretty good for Charlie Curley, a 61-year-old chauffeur who was put on the government’s job retention scheme by his employer six weeks ago.He certainly doesn’t miss the 4am starts he can have a beer or two in the evening with no danger of feeling guilty about it and, thanks to all that extra time on his hands, the lawn is immaculately mowed and his patio is — he reckons — now among the cleanest in the country.But, like many others of the UK’s 7.5 million furloughed workers, some of the novelty of being paid 80 per cent of his salary by the government wore off a while ago.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe household tasks have run out, the daily walk has become the main event of his day, and now there is growing uncertainty about whether he will have a job to go back to.Does it give you worries? Yes it does, definitely. I don’t think I’m going to get any proper work until the end of JulyThe chancellor’s announcement on Tuesday that the furlough scheme will be extended was almost universally welcomed. However, the fact that employers will have to start contributing in August to the wages of furloughed workers will mean tough decisions for many companies. Some jobs will undoubtedly go, as government wage support is withdrawn by the end of October.Questions remain about how exactly that support will be withdrawn. Rishi Sunak has promised they will be answered by the end of the month. It’s at that time that many employers will face tough decisions.“After that I don’t know.“Does it give you worries? Yes it does, definitely. I don’t think I’m going to get any proper work until the end of July because the government is paying the 80 per cent.“I think the moment my employer has to put their hands in their pocket they will have a decision to make, definitely.”There are many variables in that decision, says Mr Curley. One option is redundancy\u0026nbspperhaps some staff could be brought back part time as the more flexible furlough rules will allow from 1 August.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut the upheavals wrought by the virus are likely to wrench entire sectors of the economy from their roots, leaving some occupations in doubt, including Mr Curley’s.He and his colleagues chauffeur well-heeled executives between the boardrooms and glass skyscrapers of the City of\u0026nbspLondon, and the hedge-funds HQs that squeeze into opulent townhouses in Mayfair and St James’s.Those CEOs have flown over — business class, or first perhaps — on financial roadshows, touting their companies to investors.“There is no way that type of business is coming back this side of Christmas,” says Mr Curley.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?“It’s an expense for any company to take executives out for days to go around London, Frankfurt, Edinburgh, maybe Madrid. That’s a long time for senior people to be out.”“Whether it comes back ever is the $64,000 question.”Given the switch that many companies have made to using video-conferencing software, the continued concerns about spreading the virus and the pressure to reduce emissions, executive travel is forecast to drop off drastically.So might his employer keep him on? He suspects that, come August, the government might pay 50 to 60 per cent of his wage while his employer will have to pay 20 to 30 per cent. It may consider it’s not worth it.But Mr Curley is philosophical: “Furlough can’t go on forever and everyone knows that.“If the government mandates that employers have to start forking out 30 per cent of the wage bill while a lot of things are still shut down that will bring pain, without a shadow of doubt.”It also raises the question of whether the government is effectively subsidising jobs whose long-term future is in doubt. And how it deals with those potentially large numbers of workers who — despite its best efforts — are left without work when the support is withdrawn.The job retention scheme has been widely praised because it keeps those ties between workers and jobs. It prevents the destruction of productivity that results when businesses go under, people are put on the dole, ties are severed\u0026nbspand skills go to waste.In short, it helps to prevent\u0026nbspa painful but relatively short-term shock turning into\u0026nbsplong-term depression.But if the economy that emerges from the global pandemic is radically different to the one that entered it, many of the jobs and skills that are needed will be different, leaving a very difficult set of tasks for the Treasury to navigate. The\u0026nbsplaissez-faire\u0026nbspapproach that previous Conservative governments took to shifts in employment needs is well remembered in what was once known as Labour’s red wall.A somewhat easier call for Sunak, and one that has been universally welcomed by businesses, is the renewed flexibility of the furlough scheme. Instead of having to stop working for an employer completely while being entitled to furlough support, people can begin to go back to work part time.Rishi Sunak’s furlough scheme reforms look reasonablePrivately, many people admit that they have already been doing some work for their employer while the government has picked up the tab for wages. It is an obvious problem with the incentives of the scheme that has now been fixed.It will also allow those sectors completely shut down, like tourism, to gradually reopen, testing the waters with limited staff as demand slowly picks up.For Janet, who works for a group of holiday homes in the West Country, the furlough has saved an industry that she loves.“Initially it was a relief. It was going to be for a month but it’s been extended. I would personally rather be back at work.“Some people I know are struggling to get by on 80 per cent of their wages, but it is a very generous scheme overall.”The option to bring people back part-time is hugely welcome, she says, because it means that an important part of the economy can prepare itself for when it is allowed to welcome visitors again.Every day lost of the crucial summer season puts the hospitality industry under additional\u0026nbspthreat. If parts of the industry do not survive, the damage could be long lasting in areas\u0026nbspof the UK where options for new employment are limited.“Businesses will need to start to get up and ready to welcome visitors again,” says Janet. “You can’t just open your doors one day and everyone comes through the door.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People have been staying at home and there will be more to come,” he told Sky News.“I think the most important thing is that all the measures that Chancellor Rishi has been taking have at least ensured that some protection has been brought about.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the first quarter fall was better than the 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspexpected by most experts and the 3 per cent\u0026nbspforecast by the Bank of England last week.“A quarter-on-quarter drop in the second quarter of about 20 per cent\u0026nbsplooks plausible,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Even if we make some allowance for a marginal recovery in output in May, as employees in the construction, manufacturing and real-estate sectors tentatively return to work, and then a more comprehensive recovery in June, when most shops and schools should reopen.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Reduced energy demand more generally also saw a drop in output from fossil fuel power stations.Recent data from multiple environmental organisations has revealed a massive\u0026nbspdrop in CO2 emissions in 2020, showing that the coronavirus pandemic has caused the biggest carbon crash on record.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveal the unprecedented\u0026nbspscale of the emissions decline, which is six-times larger than the previous record reduction that followed the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis.Projected figures for 2020 forecast the biggest ever percentage drop in CO2 emissions - more than any previous war or global economic crisis.There has also been a huge reduction\u0026nbspin air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions.NO2 is\u0026nbspreleased when fossil fuels are burned in cars, airplanes and other combustion engines, contributing to the formation of harmful smog that causes respiratory and other serious health problems.Stay at home orders that were in place across the UK throughout April saw NO2 emissions plunge, as people avoided driving, flying and using public transport.The reduction in NO2 and other pollutants as a result of the coronavirus lockdown has resulted in 11,000 fewer deaths from air pollution in Europe, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).A recent CREA report also revealed that reduced energy demand during lockdown resulted in power generation from coal falling by 37 per cent across Europe in April.

The complaints have been investigated by\u0026nbspLiberty Investigates, an arm of human rights group Liberty.The study aims to monitor the current rate of infection and find out how many people may have developed antibodies in the UK. Up to 300,000 participants are expected to be\u0026nbspstudied over 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLaunched on 23 April, the first stage saw 10,000 households asked\u0026nbspto take part, with participants providing\u0026nbspa nose and throat swab to test. Adults in a smaller number of households were asked to provide a blood sample to see if they had developed antibodies.The survey is billed as a representative study of the UK population and is being\u0026nbspled by the Department for Health and Social Care\u0026nbspand the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The University of Oxford, data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes\u0026nbspare also working on the survey.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?When the study began, IQVIA’s capacity to cope with phone calls was limited and members of the public invited to take part said that they could not get through to make appointments. Since then, participants have made other complaints.One participant told Liberty Investigates they had\u0026nbspconcerns about their own health after being visited by testing staff. Another said they made 77 calls to arrange appointments, with only one being fulfilled and three appointments being missed.These are not isolated issues. Complaints made via social media to IQVIA, which is responsible for the doorstep data collection, show participants complaining about poor sample collection, systematic no-shows by testing staff, and a lack of test kits, resulting in missed appointments.One survey participant, who did not wish to be named, said\u0026nbspthey waited\u0026nbspfor a first appointment and nobody turned up. When a second appointment was booked, the participant was “surprised and concerned that a nurse arrived at my doorstep without PPE, other than a pair of gloves, especially as she offered to come into my house and do the swabs”.The participant added: “We had to stand close to receive the testing equipment and sign and return the consent forms. This nurse is going from household to household without any protection for herself or those whom she visits.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe person taking part emailed their concerns to the team at the University of Oxford, the institution group overseeing the project, before the email was passed to ONS. The statistics body then replied stating that the nurse should have engaged in social distancing.ONS’s deputy lead on data collection and tracking emailed the participant, promising to look into the case. The official said they were “concerned that you state you had to stand in close proximity to receive the swabs and sign the consent forms”.They added: “There are clear guidelines that state the materials are to be bagged and left for the respondent to collect whilst the study health worker retreats to the requisite distance. I can appreciate why this made you anxious for the health of yourself, the study health practitioner and others.”The paperwork given to all participants states: “The study healthcare worker will use all the recommended precautions to protect you and other people in your home from getting the virus. The study health worker will bring all the necessary equipment, including PPE with them to your home for a visit.”No health worker turned up for the woman’s second test, which was supposed to be a week later – and she has not been contacted since.The apparent failures\u0026nbspraise\u0026nbspconcerns not only about communication, but the extent to which the data is useful if the weekly tests are not carried out as regularly as intended. Participants are supposed to be swabbed five times at weekly intervals, and thereafter every month for a period of 12 months.Paul Beauchamp told The Independent about his\u0026nbspexperience taking part in the infection survey, describing it as “a bit of a shambles from the start” because\u0026nbspthe test worker “clearly had almost no training”.Covid test results from commercial labs not shared with local NHS“I’m absolutely not blaming him. It was clear he’d been asked to do a job for which he hadn’t been properly trained or equipped.”Mr Beauchamp added: “Both my wife and I volunteered but he only had details for me so couldn’t also take samples from her. I was then told I’d get a call to make an appointment for the following week and have heard nothing a week later.”David Wilkin, who also agreed to take part in the survey, said that he and his family had made four appointments. It took 77 phone calls to get through. After one no-show and several more calls, a nurse appeared, wearing a clinical mask and gloves. However, the second and third scheduled visits did not happen.Mr Wilkin, who has now withdrawn from the survey, said: “I am absolutely disgusted by the incompetence. It is a sadly missed opportunity to collect important data. That opportunity has now been missed.”A spokesperson for the survey said: “Drawing on the proven research capabilities of highly experienced partners, this large collaborative study has been started at very short notice, during difficult and restrictive working conditions caused by the virus.“We have published initial estimates of the number of people in England positive for Covid-19, based on thousands of swabs and bloods already collected from across the UK in less than a month.”The spokesperson added: “We are unable to comment on inidual cases but are aware that our partners are working hard to deliver at pace whilst ensuring PPE and health and safety standards are observed by staff during swab and blood collection appointments. These are essential to protect the public and our partner healthcare professionals.“We’d like to thank everyone who has responded to our call to take part in this vital research. Over the coming months, the results of this work will be central to our understanding of how this virus spreads. By taking part they are helping with the international effort to understand and combat the impact of Covid-19.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We needed to know the seismic properties of the iron-sulfur alloy thought to make up the core of Mars.”The Insight probe is a lander that measures the planet’s “vital signs” such as its “pulse” (seismology), “temperature” (heat flow), and “reflexes” (precision tracking), Nasa\u0026nbspexplains.Previously, it has found activity of seismic quakes, called “Marsquakes”, which helps identify geologic layers in the planet.Space debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutes“The exploration of the deep interiors of Earth, Mars and other planets is one of the great frontiers of science,” said\u0026nbspNishida. “It\u0027s fascinating partly because of the daunting scales involved, but also because of how we investigate them safely from the surface of the Earth.”As part of the research, the scientists were able to calculate the seismic data that would be shown if Mars\u0027s core is made of an iron-sulphur alloy, or something else. Researchers now hope they can gather measurements from the red planet to compare, and so understand the truth of the inside of the planet, and whether it is made as scientists expect.Astronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsUS Space Force debuts first recruitment ad and secret space vehicle From a deep-space mystery to the longest creature in the ocean“If it isn\u0027t, that will tell us something of Mars\u0027 origins. For example, if Mars\u0027 core includes silicon and oxygen, it suggests that, like the Earth, Mars suffered a huge impact event as it formed. So, what is Mars made of and how was it formed? I think we are about to find out.” Nishida said.Simulations of Mars allow for research on its structure and details, without travelling the up to 400 million kilometres between us and the planet.The Earth and Mars were both formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago, and therefore comparisons between their cores can provide vital information about how they were formed – especially as the two planets are so strikingly different.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a mess, like listening to a cat walking on a piano.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, by using the data from Nasa, team was able to make sense of those pulsations, with the help of brightness measurements of thousands of stars.The incredibly precise data from NASA\u0027s\u0026nbspTESS\u0026nbspmission have allowed us to cut through the noise. Now we can detect structure, more like listening to nice chords being played on the piano, Professor Bedding said.Nasa asks private companies to start making lunar landersThe new findings will allow scientists to understand the stars using a technique called astroseismology. Just as scientists can learn more about the inside of the Earth from tracking the reverberations from earthquakes, scientists are able to use similar principles to study the inside of stars by watching their pulsations.The stars in question are known as delta Scuti stars, and are named after the first of them to be found, a star that is visible from Earth in the constellation Scutum. They are roughly 1.5 to 2.5 times the mass of our Sun.Researchers had detected a huge number of pulsations from the thousands of\u0026nbspthose stars they have discovered. But the pulsations seemed to have no discernable rhythm or pattern, making them unable to learn further information about them.Now in the new research, published in Nature, scientists were able to pick up regularly pulsations from 60 of the stars, which were between 60 and 1400 light years away. Those are thought to be younger stars, meaning that their pulsations happen more rapidly – as they age, the frequency of the pulsations slows and they become jumbled with other signals.This definitive identification of pulsation modes opens up a new way by which we can determine the masses, ages and internal structures of these stars, said Professor Bedding.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But it also takes regular images of the stars themselves, and it was in those pictures that the scientists could spot regular changes in the delta Scuti stars.The data from the telescope allowed them to gather a large enough dataset on the stars to watch their quick changes, over a long time. That allowed them to isolate the well-behaved examples, and conduct further follow-up observations using ground-based telescopes.This really is a breakthrough. Now we have a regular series of pulsations for these stars that we can understand and compare with models, said co-author Simon Murphy, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Sydney.It\u0027s going to allow us to measure these stars using asteroseismology in a way that we\u0027ve never been able to do. But it\u0027s also shown us that this is just a stepping-stone in our understanding of Delta Scuti stars.Astronomers have already used the findings to settle debate about the age of one recently-discovered\u0026nbspstar known as HD31901, which is part of a stream of stars that orbit within our galaxy. Some researchers suggested that the stream was about a billion years old, while others said it formed only 120 million years ago – and the new data suggests the younger age is correct.Delta Scuti stars have been frustrating targets because of their complicated oscillations, so this is a very exciting discovery, said Sarbani Basu, a professor of astronomy at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who studies asteroseismology but was not involved in the study.Being able to find simple patterns and identify the modes of oscillation is game changing. Since this subset of stars allows normal seismic analyses, we will finally be able to characterize them properly.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But he died alone in hospital\u0026nbspto the deadly\u0026nbspvirus that has stolen the lives of many thousands, with his loved ones unable to say a proper goodbye.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCompounding the grief is his family’s fear for their own future in the UK. Aylin has been in the country almost all her life, with Jose and his wife, Martha, having left Honduras with her in 2005 due to increasingly dangerous threats from gangs. They were granted leave to remain in 2015 with a no recourse to public funds (NRPF) condition attached to their immigration status, meaning that while they may work in Britain, they have no access to state support.This inability to claim benefits had never been an issue throughout their 15 years in the UK. Jose was a self-employed carpenter, much loved by many of his customers, and was the breadwinner of the family. Martha was a full-time house cleaner\u0026nbspand Aylin – while waiting to get indefinite leave to remain so she can go to university – worked part time in a shop while doing online education courses.But both Martha and Aylin have had to stop working due to the lockdown, and that, along with the loss of Jose’s income, has left them struggling financially. Unable to apply for public benefits, they have had to dip into the money they had saved for when they need to apply for their next visa extension in January next year, which will cost several thousand pounds.“For our whole lives, we’ve never asked for any help or benefits,” says Aylin. “My father always said as long as he could\u0026nbspwork and was\u0026nbspcapable of working, we wouldn’t need help. He was a very hardworking man. Now everything is just shattered. We are lost. In terms of\u0026nbspfinances, I just want someone to tell me what\u0026nbspI need to do. I can’t cover the rent myself.“I don’t know what the future holds. If we get denied access to public funds, I don’t know what we’re going to do. We can’t go back to Honduras, there’s nothing there. It would be like starting from zero. I want to continue with my education here. I need some help for my mum.”Boy left homeless because Home Office unlawfully refused him benefitsThe children going hungry during the coronavirus pandemicThe people left with nothing because of coronavirus lockdownThe Vasquezes are among thousands of families in the UK who are tied to the NRPF condition, meaning they are unable to fall back on state benefits – even in a time of crisis. There have been\u0026nbspwidespread calls for the Home Office to\u0026nbspsuspend of the policy during the coronavirus pandemic, but the department has argued\u0026nbspthis is “not necessary”, saying\u0026nbsppeople can apply to have it\u0026nbsplifted if there has been a\u0026nbspchange in their financial circumstances.\u0026nbspThe family has applied\u0026nbspto have the restriction\u0026nbsplifted, but this is known to be a long and complicated process.When contacted by The Independent, a\u0026nbspgovernment spokesperson said it\u0026nbsphad also\u0026nbspbrought forward\u0026nbspmeasures in response to the\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspoutbreak, many of which could\u0026nbspbe accessed by those with NRPF.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a former alcoholic\u0026nbspwho had been sober for 25 years, Jose took it upon himself\u0026nbspto set up the country’s first Spanish-speaking Alcoholics\u0026nbspAnonymous (AA) group –\u0026nbspand it is members of this group who are helping to pay for his funeral costs.“He was such a loved man, and we’re relying on his friends to get by, but it’s the future that worries me,” Aylin says, her voice trembling. “Mum keeps going outside and\u0026nbspcalling for him. I have to wait until she goes to sleep. It’s just awful being in this flat, you feel like he’s still here. My dad was the main support. It feels like it’s all on me now. I’ve not been prepared for this.“Maybe I’m asking for too much, but we have worked very hard in this country. My dad has done his bit for the community. I just want to get my education and graduate so that I can get a better job and a better life for my mum. I’m not looking to be supported by benefits all my life. But I need help now, that’s why I’m asking for help.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation. The service has made her life “so much easier”, she said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It captures the defining message of this time – that Londoners stand together. It is a powerful expression of thanks to all the Londoners who have helped distribute food as part of the Help The Hungry appeal.”The director of the National Gallery Gabriele Finaldi said the image was particularly appropriate because Sir Peter was a former associate artist at the institution.While it is closed, the gallery has been distributing images of its artwork via social media and providing free online talks by its experts.“We were delighted to help support The Independent’s\u0026nbspHelp The Hungry appeal,” Mr Finaldi said. “Thousands of Londoners have been helping to distribute the food and so we were honoured to get involved and help recognise their contribution.”Help The Hungry: Where our readers have led, the government followsWembley Stadium taken over by food charityThe projection was displayed after British YouTube star KSI had joined The Independent\u0026nbspat the Refettorio Felix at St Cuthbert’s Centre in Earl’s Court to help distribute food.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Rolls Royce owned and operated Core Production Capability facilities at Raynesway, where the department is replacing facilities so it can produce the latest nuclear reactor core designs at a forecast cost £474m, and\u0026nbspcompletion in 2026. And the BAE Systems owned Barros shipyard where work is taking place on the modular build of Dreadnought-class submarines at a cost of £240m and completion date of 2022.“The MoD said it ‘immensely regretted’ the huge waste of taxpayers’ money, which was caused by poor management of three nuclear infrastructure projects, resulting in a combined cost increase of £1.35bn and with delays of between 1.7 and 6.3 years,” the report states.“The contracts for the three infrastructure projects did not allow the department to share the financial risk. This means the taxpayer has borne the full cost of budget overruns, including those of its subcontractors.“The department accepts the National Audit Office’s criticism that its contracts were not well designed and says it would not operate in this way in the future”, said the committee.Meg Hillier, chairperson of the committee, said: “To utterly fail to learn from mistakes over decades, to spectacularly repeat the same mistakes at a huge cost to the taxpayer – and at a huge cost to confidence in our defence capabilities – is completely unacceptable. The department knows it can’t go on like this, it knows it must change and operate differently. The test now is to see how it will do that, and soon.”“We expect the MoD to report to us later this year, in its 2020 update on the Dreadnought nuclear submarine programme. We also expect a detailed assessment, of whether the current ownership arrangements for nuclear-regulated sites are in the best interests of the taxpayer, to be provided to us by the end of this year.”Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Boots says it is not making any profit out of the scheme.But legal expert Lucy McLynn, head of employment at law firm Bates Wells, said that treating the testers as volunteers “feels pretty abusive” and may fall foul of minimum wage legislation, which is policed by HM Revenue and Customs.The law exempts charities and fundraising bodies from the requirement to pay the £8.72-an-hour national living wage to people volunteering to help them, but does not allow companies to treat people as volunteers if they are taking the role of a worker, she explained.“I think Boots are in rather dangerous territory with this, because the time commitment suggests these people are more like workers,” Ms McLynn told The Independent.“HMRC has powers to enforce the Minimum Wage Act and this looks set to be a high-profile arrangement, so they may feel they want to look at it.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company says will be flexible about the times to be worked, but adds that it is\u0026nbsp”vitally important” that participants attend testing sites at the hours agreed. Volunteers are asked to give as much notice as possible if they\u0026nbspwant to stop,\u0026nbspso that rotas can be rearranged.Employment law barrister Nicola Braganza, of Garden Court Chambers, said the recruitment ads raised “a number of serious concerns”. Volunteer workers would miss out not only on pay but also on holiday entitlements and discrimination protections, she said.“They appear to be relying on the goodwill of people to agree to work without pay or the benefit of any employment rights protection,” said Ms Braganza. “Other companies are paying staff to do the same work.“Describing a person as a volunteer will not necessarily mean that they are in fact and in law a volunteer. The advert refers to a mandatory requirement to carry out specified contracted hours.“Volunteers are asked to work long hours in physically and mentally demanding roles and presumably expected to comply with whatever instructions they are given.\u0026nbspAll of this tends to undermine that the relationship is a genuine volunteer – one with no mutuality of obligation.”TUC employment rights officer Tim Sharp told The Independent that the company’s approach appeared to be at odds with the spirit seen when 700,000 people signed up to volunteer to help the NHS, at a time when many Boots employees were being paid by the state under the furlough scheme.“It seems to me to be out of kilter with the spirit of the volunteering initiative, which was all about bringing in people who wanted to help out the health service,” he said. “Here we have a large business trying to recruit people to do what seem to be skilled and important roles which should be paid accordingly.”In his letter to Mr James, Mr McDonald said he was “curious as to why neither Boots nor the UK government are offering pay and employment benefits to testers”.“I am keen to know whether Boots has been contracted and receiving government funding for recruiting volunteers or if Boots is just offering its services to the government for free,” he said.“Advertising these high-risk but crucial roles as volunteering would be to take advantage of the public’s goodwill. Whilst similar opportunities are offered as paid roles, Boots should be treating their applicants the same –\u0026nbspfairly and properly as the key workers that they are.”A Boots spokesperson said: “Boots stepped forward to support Covid-19 testing for frontline workers at the request of the government and we are proud to play our part in helping the NHS and other frontline workers return to work.“During this phase of the crisis, this has not been in any way a commercial activity, and Boots has not sought to make any profit, only to support the NHS and the country as we have done for over 170 years.“Our role in the UK testing programme, run by the Department of Health and Social Care, is to provide and train testers for some of the UK drive-through testing sites. Many Boots employees have come forward to take part and train as testers.“We have also agreed to help with the recruitment of additional volunteers where required. We have been really pleased with the response to our request, with hundreds of people stepping forward to volunteer to do this vital work.”A spokesperson for HMRC declined to comment on the inidual case, but said that enforcement officers were empowered to investigate minimum wage cases “if we have cause for concern either if we receive intelligence or our own records show that there is an apparent discrepancy which needs looking into”.HMRC guidance for officers states that people described as volunteers may in fact be classed as workers entitled to the minimum wage if they are unable to withdraw their services at any time, if they are subject to requirements, obligations or standards from the organisation involved or if they are receiving training or any payment beyond necessary expenses.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A five-year-old boy, a seven-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl, Mr Cuomo said. These cases are all across the state, predominantly where the population is.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?He added that 14 other states and five European countries were also looking into the rare syndrome to see if there was a link to those symptoms and the novel virus.About 60 per cent of the 102 cases in New York tested positive for the coronavirus. Of those cases,\u0026nbsp70 per cent\u0026nbspwere admitted\u0026nbspinto the ICU and 19 per cent resulted in intubation.The potential link between the coronavirus and these inflammatory syndromes has caused concern among officials because children are presenting symptoms far different from the typical Covid-19 patient. The novel virus often attacks the upper respiratory system, causing a cough or difficulty breathing. But symptoms related to the rare inflammatory disease instead show\u0026nbspswelling and redness in the body\u0027s blood vessels.An estimated\u0026nbsp3,000 children are diagnosed with Kawasaki disease in the US each\u0026nbspyear.“These are children who come in who don’t present the symptoms that we normally are familiar with with Covid. It’s not a respiratory illness, they’re not in respiratory distress. I think that’s one of the reasons why this may be getting discovered this far into the process,” the governor said last week.New York hospitals are now required to report to the state health department any children who are showing symptoms mirroring Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u0026nbsphas also asked\u0026nbspNew York to develop national criteria for other states and hospital systems to assist them in recognising similar patients.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People aged 60 or over and those with comorbidities are more at risk.Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for Covid-19 than adults, the CDC\u0027s site says. While some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.The department still noted, though, that severe outcomes have been reported in children, including three deaths.One of the few rays of good news was young people weren\u0027t affected. We\u0027re not so sure that is the fact anymore, Mr Cuomo added.Connecticut reported its first case related to the syndrome on Monday. In total, health officials in the state were investigating at least six cases related to the syndrome. New Jersey also announced it was investigating 10 potential cases, none of which were fatal.The UK, Spain, and Italy are among the European countries also investigating cases related to the syndrome.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Earlier this month, some 130 British MPs\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspurged the UK to do the same in a letter to Boris Johnson.Divisions have even appeared within the US administration on the matter, Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“There has been hesitation from the US recently,” he said, pointing out that Jared Kushner, Mr Trump’s son-in-law who co-authored the\u0026nbsppeace deal, suggested Israel not move too quickly with carving up the West Bank.“There is a ided US administration... does it want to be dealing with a major foreign policy problem at the same time as the coronavirus? There is no certainty that support for annexation is an electoral boost for the administration,” he added.He noted that a six-hour visit to Israel amid intense coronavirus restrictions and fears it could pose a risk to health was “crazy”.Addressing the secretary of state on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu hinted that the formation of his new government with Mr Gantz would allow Israel to push ahead with annexation.Under the terms of the new unity government deal, the government can begin pushing forward legislation allowing annexation from the 1 July.Mr Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has battled to hold on to power after being indicted\u0026nbspon corruption charges\u0026nbsphe vehemently denies.Following three inconclusive elections in less than a year and weeks of fierce negotiations, he managed to cement a power-sharing rotation deal with Mr Gantz.Under the arrangement, Mr Netanyahu remains prime minister for 18 months, before the Mr Gantz takes over for the second half of the term.Mr Gantz, less hawkish than Mr Netanyahu, previously insisted that annexation not be unilateral but instead implemented “in coordination with the international community”.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. The Palestinians seek these territories for a future independent state.Most of the international community considers these settlements a violation of international law and obstacles to peace.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He now needs to convince frightened Britons that we can safely overcome the pandemic’s brutal economic impact.Boris himself admits that we are entering a new danger zone. But there is little time left to get Britain back on track before the economy slides into meltdown.He needs to spell out when and how we can resume our everyday lives — without it damaging our health. The scale of the PM’s challenge is revealed in our poll today.Seven weeks after people were asked to accept unprecedented restrictions on their lives, a staggering  per cent are opposed to any easing at this time. The public’s response to this challenge has been magnicent, but there is an urgent need to get Britain working again.The cost of the furlough scheme alone is already an eye-watering £billion and is spiralling by an unsustainable £.billion a day.Our poll shows most people are far more afraid of a second wave of coronavirus than the risk of losing their jobs. Only one in  believe the measures should end, and just four per cent favour an immediateto work.Boris must use his address to the nation tonight to instil confidence that “unlockdown” will be measured and safe.But he must not underplay the uncomfortable truth: It is time people grit their teeth and get the economy going again.Give it to us straight, PM.CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak’s furlough scheme has thrown millions of British workers a generous leline during the crisis.But it is outrageous when the mega-rich take advantage of it at the expense of the taxpayer.The latest are the Hinduja brothers, worth £billion, who are using the Government’s hand-outs to pay employees at one of their firms.As Britain’s richest family, why can’t they pay staff out of their own deep pockets CHINA has an enormous stake in Britain, with investments worth over £billion.As one of the world’s most powerful economies, it will also be crucial to post-Brexit trade.But this secretive and authoritarian country must not be let off the hook over its role in the coronavirus outbreak.Britain has been too slow to join other nations in pressing for a full inquiry. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear. Yet alarmingly, research out earlier this year found that millions of women hid their efforts to slim for fear of being mocked or labelled “anti-feminist”.Saints preserve us. The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent. You can’t argue with that.BOREDOM at Moore Towers has reached such a crisis point that, on Sunday, I linked my iPhone to our portable speaker, put the songs on Shuffle and said we had to endure enjoy whatever track came up.At first there were plenty of goodies from Floyd, Bowie, Prefab Sprout and Talk Talk, but then Twinkle Twinkle Little Star popped up, followed by You Spin Me Round by . . . Alvin And The Chipmunks.For the record, our youngest is now .

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

House viewings are allowed from today in England to kickstart the market, despite a legal ban on visiting other peopleaposs households remaining in force. Cleaners, nannies and boiler fitters have also already been allowed to go back to work in peopleaposs homes, as long as they maintain social distancing. That all means people can look round a strangeraposs house - but not visit their closest relatives. Instead the law only allows a maximum of two people, one from each household, to meet in a public place while staying two metres away. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps today defended the policy - saying there has to be a line somewhere. More than , coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK including thousands of newly-announced deaths each day.While some lockdown restrictions in England have been lted, the bast majority remain in place. You cannot have gatherings of more than two in public, unless from the same household, and aposnon-essentialapos shops are still shut. Mr Shapps said while there would be strict rules around house viewings, that would break downvisits happen with family who are likely to have close contact. Mr Shapps told TalkRadio the previous lockdown was strict, and as soon as you start to unlock that, you’re going to get a ‘why can I do X but I can’t do Y’ situation.He added: “My parents who I have’t now seen for months who are in their s - I’m desperate to see them. “But there has to be a cutoff line somewhere. “If you go and look at somebody’s house because you move home, it’s a one off activity. Of course when I see my mum it won’t be a one off activity, I’ll be going backwards and forwards - and it’s very dficult to maintain social distancing in a case like that, because it’s your family. “There has to be a line somewhere.” Mr Shapps said a line has to be drawn in order to gradually release things. He added to BBC Breakfast: We must understand, we have done so well in the last eight weeks we cannot throw that all away, and so these are baby steps. If someone visits a home , thataposs likely to be a one-off,you are starting to visit your family again, thataposs likely to be many more times. Somewhere there has to be a line drawn where we say this is OK but this isnapost, in order to gradually release things. And this is where that line is at the moment.  The experience of buying and selling a home will be dferent from normal times, meaning people will need to be flexible and prepared to alter plansthey cannot keep to social distancing rules. Government guidelines indicate that more of the process will take place online and some, or all, moves may still need to be paused to limit the spread of coronavirus.

So far arrivals to the UK have not been tested for the virus - nor required to go into quarantine. But that is set to change under the Prime Ministeraposs plans for easing lockdown. In his address to the nation on Sunday evening, Boris Johnson announced that arrivals by air would be required to self-isolate. The figure works out as fewer than .% of people who arrived in the UK by plane last month.  Professor John Aston told the Commonsapos Science and Technology Committee that , people arrived in the UK by plane between April  and , including , UK citizens. Askedthere is an estimate of how many of those had Covid-, he replied: We believe that less than .% of those people arriving potentially had Covid-. Half a percent of , people is  people. He went on to say that less than .% of those arriving were due to the total cases of Covid- in the UK. Prof Aston told the committee that the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesused complicated modelling to calculate the estimate. It requires you to understand the prevalencewithin overseas countries as well as the prevalence within the UK, he said.  The  Covid- “road map”  published on Monday appears to contradict  Boris Johnsonaposs assertion that it would apply only to “people coming into this country by air”. The document says: “The government will require all international arrivals not on a short list of exemptions to self-isolate in their accommodation for  days on arrival into the UK.

The Commons Speaker said everyone on the parliamentary estate must be kept safe and social distancing rules must be complied with. The requirement for two metres between people means only  MPs can attend the chamber in person, while up to  can join proceedings remotely via Zoom. Sir Lindsay told MPs: My priority and the priority of all, Iaposm sure, is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated. Iaposm working with parties, the Commission, to ensure this duty of care is taken seriously. Nothing in the Leaderaposs announcement changes the position on social distancing in and around the chamber and throughout the parliamentary estate – only changes to the guidance from Public Health England can do that.”It came as Boris Johnson backed Jacob Rees-Mogg as he urged MPs toto Parliament despite the coronavirus lockdown.People have been told to work from home where possible – and MPs have been taking part in virtual debates over video link for weeks. But Commons Leader Mr Rees-Mogg infuriated opposition parties by they should “lead by example” in going back to Westminster. He said: It is clear that soon Parliament must set an example of how we move back gradually to a fully-ing country again. “Our constituents would expect nothing less. “So while we must move in step with public health guidance, it is vital that when we are asking other people to work and go to their places of workthey cannot do so from home we should not be the ones who are exempt from that.  “Indeed, we should be leading by example. Prospect union deputy general secretary Garry Graham branded the announcement “extremely worrying for all those working in Parliament who have as much right as anyone to be kept safe during this pandemic”. He added: “The example it would be setting by adopting this approach would be to undermine the Government’s first rule that those who can work from home should continue to do so. “Having more MPs on site would mean hundreds more staff who are currently working safely from home would be needed in Parliament there has so far been no risk assessment factoring in increasing numbers of MPs and staff.” But No backed Mr Rees-Mogg, with the Prime Ministeraposs spokesman saying: “Itaposs vital that Parliament can continue to scrutinise the Government and legislate to support the coronavirus response. “The existing, temporary arrangements limit some of these s – that is why work is ongoing by the House authorities in step with the public health advice to carefully move back to more ordinary business and have more political proceedings in the House.” “The Government supports those efforts and, in line with health advice, MPs should be encouraged to come back to Westminster once arrangements are in place.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what farce governments plan lift","story":"NewsopinionWhat a farce: the Governments plan to lt lockdown, in all its unutterable madnessFrom sitting in parks while ignoring your mum, to not looking people in the eye and letting Norwich take charge, Boris Johnsons strategy is a messShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  MAY Newsopinion\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

For £, reckons it can test each citizen in their own homes, and lt lockdown all the sooner. The government response is something to behold. We may end up engaging with the proposals but it is not something that will happen imminently, said a spokesman, giving the impression that pandemics are a matter of no urgency outside Norfolk.

Pooch Molly has developed such a special bond with owner Fliss she has been able to train her to find plastic bottles, ropes, spades, buckets, and toys. And the inseparable duo have become famous in Scarborough for their ongoing efforts cleaning up the coastline  days a year. Hailing her furry friend, Fliss, , said: I can’t take credit for her great work, she’s the best dog and it’s really just the way she is. She’s my best bud, we work together, live together, play together, she’s at my side literally all the time. If I spent this much time with a human we would have fallen out by now, but the bond between a dog and their owner just gets stronger over time.  She’s super chilled, always up for an adventure and has to say hello to every single person and dog she meets. Molly is just a brilliant dog, I often wonder how I got so lucky, she has a beautul, happy soul and has changed my le for the better. The funny thing is she still doesn’t know the dference between an empty discarded bottle and a bottle that is still full which has led to some interesting situations. She’ll sometimes come back to me with a full bottle and I’ll look across the beach and there’ll be a confused person wondering why this dog has just stolen their drink. Her intentions are good though, and she’s just trying to do the right thing. Thankfully no one ever gets angry because she’s so cute!  Fliss said Molly picks up so many pieces of litter every day, the items have started to take over her home and workplace. She explained: I could probably fill a wheelie bin every week or two with what we collect. At one point my garage was probably % filled with beach litter waiting to be distributed to local artists for use in artwork sculptures etc. I also save any buckets spades beach toys that can be reused, and let tourists borrow them for the day - so my shop also has a couple of hundred of these which takes up quite a bit of space.Fliss has shared her inspiring story as part of IAMSapos latest campaign celebrating the magic of pets and the iniduality of each animal. She said Molly loves tucking into her breakfast bowl before a busy day doing her extra special job for the community.  Itaposs so important to give dogs a healthy, nutritious and balanced diet, which will keep them going all day! she told us. Molly needs it when sheaposs up and down the beach - the exercise is great for her as well.  IAMS champion the joy of your pet’s healthy vitality. Itaposs not simply visible health or your dog’s happiness it is a powerful combination of the two together. And that’s why IAMS want to help the nation’s pets live healthy, active and happy lives through the expert nutrition they truly enjoy. No compromise. Fliss moved to the seaside in  where she opened a bath and skincare shop - but she couldn’t believe how much litter she found left senselessly on the beach and said she was shocked and appalled by the “unavoidable” amount of litter she found while taking Molly for walks She added: Mollyaposs such a good girl and she’s never had any issues unless she spots a tennis ball - tennis balls take precedence over everything.  We get stopped all the time by people who think it’s adorable that she’s cleaning. She gets so much attention and she loves it, she knows she’s a bit of a star. Unfortunately Molly can’t clean the beach on her own, but she’s trying. We want to get people involved or at least make them think twice before disposing of their litter so carelessly.

Doctors used a special oxygen machine to keep Joseph Nicholson alive while they waited for an organ donor. Called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, it uses a pump to circulate blood through an articial lung that oxygenates the blood. Doctors kept Joseph on it continuously until his operation – the first time that had been done in this country. In his nine-month stay at Freeman and Great North Children’s Hospital in Newcastle, Joseph celebrated his fth birthday with parents Fiona and Gary. Fiona, a teacher of Catterick, in North Yorkshire, said: “It’s been a rollercoaster. Throughout it, we’ve tried really hard not to think past the next day. “We didn’t want to panic, to think about worst-case scenarios. “Every time we spoke to the doctors we focused on what was the next step to getting Joseph better.” After receiving his new lungs from a donor in Europe, the youngster is ready to continue his “phenomenal journey”, according to paediatric respiratory physician Matthew Thomas. And yesterday Fiona and accountant Gary, both , enjoyed their first full day at home with Joseph, who is autistic, and his little brother, Henry. “We want to thank the hospital staff for everything,” they said. “All the team, Matt, [Dr] Malcolm Brodlie and surgeons – they have been absolutely wonderful, and are our heroes.”.” Until last summer, Joseph was a healthy boy who loved toy trains.  After developing what appeared to be mild pneumonia, he deteriorated rapidly and progressed to profound lung failure. Following aggressive and extensive treatment, it became clear Joseph would die without a lung transplant. ECMO is used at a handful of centres to care for babies and children suffering severe heart or respiratory failure. But it is rarely used as a bridge to lung transplantation, and the approach had not been successfully tried in the UK. Joseph’s story comes days before Mirror-backed Max and Keira’s law on organ donation comes into force. It means from May , all adults in England will be assumed to be donors when they die, unless they opt out. And Joseph’s parents want to raise awareness about donation, especially in children. Fiona said: “We never realised it could be months before a suitable donor was found but we were lucky and will always be thankful. It was a miracle, really.” With the country in lockdown, Joseph, who is still on ventilation and has a tracheostomy, will isolate at home. Both parents ided their time between hospital wards and the Sick Children’s Trust, which provides accommodation for families of poorly children.

A study has found one in five of those in the capital have already cancelled some of their non-essential monthly payments, and a further  per cent are thinking about it.Meanwhile, just  per cent of people in the east Midlands have put a pause on subscriptions like Netflix, veg boxes or National Trust memberships.Craig Tillotson, CEO and co-founder of payments service Ordo, which commissioned the study, said: The UK lockdown means many of us are having to take a much closer look at our personal finances. With growing uncertainty about their income, consumers want a tighter grip on money matters, and many are using this opportunity to undertake a much needed aposFinancial MOTapos. We know people are starting to cut back on those discretionary items or services as a first port of call, before they review essential everyday expenditure or charitable causes close to their heart. The research of , adults also found the south east is home to those most worried about their finances as the UKaposs lockdown continues. Londoners are much more likely than anyone  to try and get out of a car lease - due to living in a city where you are never too far away from a supermarket. Just over a thirdof people in the south west have binned their gym membership - or are thinking about it. And despite being confined to their homes, people in Scotland are most likely to have put a stop to their Spoty or other music streaming subscription.  It also emerged six in  Londoners plan on reinstating all direct debits they cancel during the lockdown period. However, just  per cent of east Midlanders will do the same, and only  per cent of people in the north east. The research also found people in the north east pay out the MOST in direct debits each month - on average, a huge £. per person. While the figure in the east Midlands is almost £ less - just £. per person on average. Craig Tillotson added: This research shows that the economic consequences of Covid- are magnying consumersapos existing need to be in control of their money.

The spread of Covid- and the measures to contain it are having a signicant impact on the United Kingdom and many countries around the world, a statement issued by the bank said at the time. Activity has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and unemployment has risen markedly. Economic data have continued to be consistent with a sudden and very marked drop in global activity.  Oil prices have been volatile.There have, however, been tentative signs of recovery in domestic spending in China, and this is likely to be echoed in other countries that have started to relax Covid-related restrictions on economic activity.

Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organisationaposschief scientist, told the FTaposs Global Boardroom digital conference: I would say in a four to five-year timeframe, we could be looking at controlling this. Influential factors include whether the virus matures, the containment measures put in place and the development of a vaccine, she told the conference. She said that a vaccine seems for now the best way out, but there were lots of s and buts about its efficacy and safety, as well as its production and equitable distribution, the newspaper reported. Asked about the comments during the WHOaposs tri-weekly briefing from Geneva, Dr Mike Ryan, who heads up the organisationaposs health emergencies programme, said no one could predict when the disease would disappear. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    But he also issued a warning about easing lockdown measures without appropriate surveillance measures in place adding: We should not be waiting to seeopening of lockdowns have worked counting the bodies in the morgue. He said: We have a new virus entering the human population for the first time, and therefore it is very hard to predict when we will prevail over it.  What is clear, and I think maybe what Soumya may have been alluding to, is that the current number of people in our population whoaposve been infected is actually relatively low. Andyouaposre a scientist, and you project forward in the absence of a vaccine, and you try and calculate aposhow long is it going to take for enough people to be infected so that this disease settles into an endemic traceapos  And it is important to put this on the table - this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities. And this virus may never go away. HIV has not gone away, weaposve come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods, and people donapost feel as scared as they did before and weaposre offering long healthy le to people with HIV.  He continued: I donapost think anyone can predict when orthis disease will disappear. We do have one great hope -we do find a highly effective vaccine that we can distribute to everyone who needs it in the world, we may have a shot at eliminating this virus. But that vaccine will have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone, and we will have to use it. But citing unvaccinated populations for diseases like measles, he went on: Forgive meIaposm cynical. But we have some perfectly effective vaccines on this planet that we have not used effectively for diseases we could eliminate and eradicate and we havenapost done. Weaposve lacked the will, we have lacked the determination to invest in health systems to deliver that. And therefore, science can come up with the vaccine - someone is going to make it and weaposve got to make enough of it so everyone can get a dose of it and weaposve got to be able to deliver that. And people have got to want to take that vaccine. Every single one of those steps is fraught with challenges. But he added: Itaposs a massive opportunity for the world.  The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic, and we could - with a massive moonshot - find a vaccine and give that to everyone who needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn, maybe what has been a tragic pandemic, into a beacon of hope for the future of our planet and the way we care for our citizens. Meanwhile, on countries reopening after lockdowns, Dr Ryan warned that surveillance systems must be in place or it could be days or weeks before officials know the virus is accelerating again. If that virus transmission accelerates and you donapost have the systems to detect it, it will be days or weeks before you know something has gone wrong. And by the time that happens, youaposre back into a situation where your only response is another lockdown. And I think this is what we all fear - a vicious cycle of public health disaster, followed by an economic disaster, followed by public health disaster, followed by economic disaster. He went on: If the health system gets time to recover, then it can cope with another rise in cases, and the health system can probably do that a few times. Iaposm not sure how many times the economic system can do that.

Howard Fisher, head of St Georgeaposs Church of England Primary School in Sheerness, Kent, said heaposd rather his pupils retake a year again than let one of them die.The heartfelt message has been shared more than , times on Facebook amid Boris Johnson aposs plans to reopen schools from June , Kent Live reports.The Prime Minister told the nation this week he expected early years, Reception and Year  children toto school from the start of next month. Mr Fisher told parents and s that in  years of leadership, he has learnt that being truthful and expecting the worst case scenario had served him well. So he continued by slamming the government announcement, saying he heard nothing that would put his mind at rest in regards to having four, five, six and -year-olds back in the school environment. The letter, dated May , said: We have no plans sent from the government before the announcement last night. No doubt they will arrive this week suggesting social distancing, less pupils in school, splitting them up, staggered lunches and drop offs, etc. I can be truthful here and categorically tell you there is no such thing as social distancing in a school it does not exist and would never exist. The reason childhood illnesses spread in a school is surprise, surprise, we are all in contact with each other. I can put two children in opposite classrooms and they will still get chicken pox because that’s how it is in a school. This virus we are lead to believe is a super spreader. Since then, the government has published a report of how it sees schools ing from June .  It cements Mr Fishersapos predictions, and encourages staggered break times, drop offs and pick-ups, and reducing numbers in classrooms. It also asks teachers to encourage regular  second handwashing, and for cleaning regimes to be ramped up. Parents who choose not to send their child into school due to fears they will contract COVID- will not be fined, it has since emerged. The letter continued: Do I want the staff and the children back of course. Are you at the end of your tether at home of course you are. However I am not going to sit here and write to you to say we can achieve social distancing in a school. We can always make things safer, we could perhaps reduce slightly the risk, but as soon as you open the school as far as my many years can tell you, the risk will be there. So that leaves us all in a quandary doesn’t it  How long can we go on like this for  Unfortunately I heard no answers last night, I heard no solutions. I heard that it is ok to put our youngest children back in a school and our oldest. I heard nothing that would put my mind at rest.  There will be some of you that say, ‘let’s just get on with it,’ I respect that, but get on with what  There is not a reliable test, a vaccine, an idea about what to do next, there is just the possibility that things will be ok that’s all we have at the moment and ‘ok’ is not good enough when it comes to the precious gt that is your child. The government policy says it has chosen to proceed with this measure because the scientic evidence shows it is the right time. Among the list of reasons, it says there is high scientic confidence that children of all ages have less symptoms than adultsthey contract the virus. It continues to say that there is a moderately high scientic confidence that younger children are less likely to become unwellthey do get infected. The evidence also suggests that limiting the number of children going back and then gradually increasing this number reduces the rate of transmission.

According to the latest Government figures, at least  people in Barrow-in-Furness, tucked away on the coast of Cumbria, caught the killer bug since the outbreak began in February. There are just , people living in the town on the Furness peninsula in the north west of England, so with a rate of  cases per , this means equates to . per cent. This means Barrowaposs infection rate is more than double that of Walesand over three times Englandaposs rateand Scotlandaposs . When compared to the rate in Northern Irelandaposs rate of  it is quadruple. Out of the cases in Barrow,  people have died after contracting coronavirus, giving it a death rate of  for every , – this is one the worst death rates outside of London. Officials are perplexed as to why the town has suffered so badly even though it attracts far fewer tourists than the number that visit the nearby Lake District. An Office for National Statisticsreport this month claimed that people living in the poorest parts of the country are dying at twice the rate of those in wealthier areas.  Experts say poorer people are more at risk as they are more likely to work in jobs that cannot be done from home, live in overcrowded homes and use public transport more. Lee Roberts, deputy leader of Barrow Borough Council, believes high levels of deprivation could be a factor of the high number of cases. He called the figures in Barrow a aposbig worryapos as lockdown measures are relaxed today.  He added: Most of Barrow is very compact:  to  per cent of Barrow is terraced housing and we’ve got a lot of flats, we’ve got a lot of deprivation, a lot of health inequalities. The poorest are also more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and have compromised immune systems - putting them at an increased risk. Barrow has high levels of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasecompared with the national average – both of which make symptoms of the virus worse.  Mr Roberts added: We have quite a lot of historic respiratory problems from people who worked in old industry, in the ship yards. Barrow also has higher than average numbers of patients with diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, which are all risk factors for Covid-. According to some estimates, over s are  time more likely to fall critically ill with coronavirus and Barrow’s population is also older than average, with . per cent of residents aged  to .  In England the average is . per cent. But some of the cases can be traced to a house party in Barrow which took place before lockdown in March. It was attended by a apossuper spreaderapos resulting in at least six people contracting the virus and the townaposs first ever death, according to . But how the disease infected hundreds more in Barrow is a mystery.  The figures show Lancaster in Lancashire has the second highest rate at  and Cumbria is also home to the area with the third highest infection rate as South Lakeland, which is east of Barrow-in-Furness, having a rate of  cases per , people. Experts are unable to work out why the North West has become a hotspot for coronavirus cases but local public health officials think it might be because more people are being tested.  The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trustcovers three hospitals treating coronavirus patients - the Furness general in Barrow, the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and the Westmorland general in Kendal in South Lakeland. According to NHS England the trust has recorded  deaths. Colin Cox, the director of public health for Cumbria, claims the NHS trust began mass-testing its employees and patients at the end of February and has done three times as much tests on average.  He told : The rate of testing in Barrow has been two to three times higher than in many other parts of the north-west, so that will explain a fair chunk of it, but I don’t think it will explain all of it. Ashford in Kent has the fourth highest infection rate of  cases per ,, followed by Gateshead , Sunderland , South Tyneside , Middlesborough , Carlisleand the tenth place has been named as Brent - the only region in London to feature in the top . ONS figures shows there have been  deaths around a small cluster of streets in Harlesden, which is in Brent, alone.  Hastings in East Sussex has the lowest rate in England with  in , contracting the virus. This is followed by Mendip, Somerset , Torridge in North Devon , Rutland in East Midlands , West Lindsey in Lincolnshire , North East Lincolnshire , Rother in East Sussex , South Hams in Devonand Arun in West Sussex . University Hospitals Birmingham has been revealed as the hospital trust to be hardest in the country by coronavirus with at least  deaths. Throughout England, every major hospital trust, except childrenaposs hospitals, has now recorded at least person who has died after testing with coronavirus but some have been hit harder than others.  The  worst-affected hospital trusts, in London, Birmingham, Derby and Manchester, have recorded , deaths. This equates to  per cent of the total death toll at just . per cent of the countryaposs hospitals. The figures also shows coronavirus is more prevalent in the big cities as  of the  worst affected hospitals have been in London, two in Birmingham, two in Manchester and the others in Liverpool, Leeds and Sunderland. The  people who have died at the hospitals in Birmingham make up . per cent of the , who are confirmed coronavirus death in Englandaposs hospitals so far. The death toll there is  per cent higher than Barts Health Trust in central London, the second most affected, where  people died. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible According to NHS England data London North West University Healthcare , Kingaposs College Hospital , Royal Free London , Imperial College HealthcareBarking, Havering  Redbridgeand Lewisham and Greenwichfill out the majority of the  hospitals with the most victims. The others have been named as University Hospitals of Derby and Burtonand Pennine Acute Hospitals in Manchester . Scientists say coronavirus is most likely to spread in cities because people live closer together than in more rural areas. They are more likely to come close to large numbers of strangers, rely on public transport and touch contaminated surfaces such as handrails or door handles. While  hospitals have recorded  or more deaths, and make up half of the entire victim count , there are only  which have recorded just one death each. Another  have recorded two deaths each and  have had  or fewer fatalities. Smaller, more niche settings such as community health partnerships, minor hospitals, private hospitals and childrenaposs hospitals, have recorded fewer fatalities.

Influenza killed , people in Europe in the - winter.  “The flu season ended earlier than usual this year and this is probably due to the measures taken regarding SARS-CoV-, such as social distancing and mask wearing,” Holger Rabenau, virologist at the Frankfurt University Hospital, told Reuters, using the scientic name of the new coronavirus. But laboratories have been so overwhelmed with COVID- and have had fewer flu samples at their disposal, meaning they “may not have the full picture of the virus circulating in the last part of the season,” said Pasi Penttinen, a senior flu expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control . Fewer data and delays in processing information could affect the quality of the vaccine for the  winter season in the southern hemisphere, whose composition is usually decided in September based on samples collected at the start of the year.

Although the government is beginning to gently ease some lockdown measures, salons and barbers are not currently allowed to open as it would be impossible to maintain two metres of social distancing. Salons and barbers will not be allowed to open until the start at July at the very earliest. However, the man from Leeds posted an Instagram story with the caption: Trims going down at a secret location tell your cousins, dads, neighbours, anyone and everyone. When asked about the validity of charging people for haircuts during a global pandemic, the man then says: Dw were [sic] keeping our  metres. He even suggests that the aposwork from homeapos motto applies to him - despite the government rules stating that no barbers are currently allowed to be open. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible He then appeared to post a separate Instagram story responding to criticism by saying: People getting @ me for my last snap cause I be making + bill a day whilst they sat on their ass. Capitalise whilst u can no ones [sic] gonna feed your familythey go broke. When he is pushed again on why he is charging people for haircuts instead of claiming money through the governmentaposs furlough scheme, he says: Dog eat dog in this world.

He went on to imply Mondayaposs guidance on safety was a “draft” and will be reissued after further consultation with Public Health England. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The adviser, speaking in a virtual Science and Technology Select Committee meeting yesterday, also said the re-opening decision had been made by the cabinet and not the Department for Education after modelling done by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . “The June  opening is dependent on a bunch of conditions being met as I think the prime minister announced, he continued.  So schools have been asked to prepare for that opening.” In relation to what the guidance is on when teachers will be required to wear personal protective equipment, Mr Rahman said: “I don’t know, I don’t think I was necessary at the PPE meeting. You’ll have to ask SAGE that.” The Government expects children in England to be able toto nurseries, and for Reception, Year  and Year  pupils to be back in school, from June  at the earliest. Mr Rahman went on to admit that it was possible hundreds of potential vectors for the virus could be brought together amid a wider reopening of schools, adding there is always a risk of transmission.  He also told MPs that he did not know exactly how many young people under  had died from Covid-. Carol Monaghan, MP for Glasgow North West, said: As a former teacher listening to this I donapost think the profession is going to be at all satisfied by what they are hearing at the moment. Addressing the chief scientic adviser, Tory MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Education Select Committee, said: Surely you must have the scientic evidence, youaposre able to tell me the base underpinning the Departmentaposs decision to reopen schools to Reception, Year  and Year  first   In response, Mr Rahman said: That was not a departmental decision. That was a Cabinet decision following advice from Sage via the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser and CMO. His comments came after an alliance of education unions called on the Government to step back from its plan to reopen schools from next month. The unions, representing school leaders, teachers and support staff, have accused the Government of showing a lack of understanding about the dangers of the spread of coronavirus in schools. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: When you have medical and scientic advice that is saying itaposs the right time to start bringing schools back in a phased and controlled manner, it seems only the right thing to do and the only responsible thing to do. He said: We continue to follow the best medical and scientic advice and believe that this phasedis the most sensible course of action to take.  Mr Williamson added he was more than happy to share all the advice that we have received from SAGE. He also revealed he’d asked scientic advisers “to give briefings for the sector” to “help them understand” the decision. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of parents have signed a petition asking for a choice about when their children shouldto school. It was started last Tuesday by mum Lucy Browne, , who has a five year old daughter in a reception class. On her petition, called: “Give parents the option not to send children back to schoolthey reopen in June”, she wrote: “As a mum I don’t want to face serious repercussions for making a choice I feel affects the safety of my daughter during a global pandemic.” Less than , had put their names to it before Mr Johnson addressed the nation about his plans on Sunday evening.

Travellers looking to venture further afield have also been putting their plans back until later. One company has even reported doing six months’ business in the space of last month as the crippled sector vowed to bounce back from the impact of the pandemic. Business chiefs say that, with government help and the ramping-up of testing, the industry can see a way through the worst crisis many can ever recall. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was “just a reality of le” that breaks abroad are off limits after the Government announced a -day quarantine for international arrivals into Britain. Package holiday giant Tui laid bare the scale of the crisis yesterday as it announced , job losses. Days earlier, PO Ferries unveiled , job cuts and British Airways is proposing up to , redundancies – more than a quarter of its workforce. Experts predict UK package holiday firms could lose up to £billion worth of sales this year. Research out yesterday from website GoCompare found nearly . million Britons have cancelled holiday plans because of Covid-.Tourism body VisitBritain forecasts visitor numbers from abroad will be down % this year, with a £.billon slump in spending.  John Hays, founder and chief executive of Sunderland-based Hays Travel, which bought collapsed Thomas Cook’s  shops last year, saving more than , jobs, said: “The whole travel industry is in absolute crisis. It is in the eye of the storm.” But we Irene, who chairs the business, is adamant the industry can “absolutely” recover. The chain, which has not made any redundancies during the crisis, says around % of existing customers are deferring their bookings to later this summer, rebooking or getting credit notes. Around , furloughed staff are back working on full pay dealing with refunds – Irene says some travel operators are “dragging their heels” – or handling a rush of new bookings. John said: “Some of our agents did in April what they would do in six months. We are seeing people wanting overseas holidays and even cruises, which is really strong.” The couple said their “peace of mind” guarantee – allowing customers to cancel or amend their holiday for free up to six weeks before departure – has helped. The couple, who have reduced their pay to minimum wage to cut costs, have no regrets about buying Thomas Cook’s retail arm.  Irene said they have an -month business plan that “doesn’t make for pretty reading,” but adds that no redundancies are planned. John says the one single thing that could help restore confidence is testing for the virus: “People could be tested before they got on the aircraft. “If there were good, reliable tests, it would reassure people. It could make a big dference.” Tui said it is ready to resume providing holidays this year, using new social distancing and cleaning measures. Chief executive Fritz Joussen said: “Demand for holidays is still very high.

Joanna Lewis, from Kent, purchased the run-down s style house in  with hopes to transform it from what neighbours called the ugliest house on the street to her dream home - and she didnapost disappoint. The mum-of-two spent two laborious years renovating it, and eventually moved in with her two young children and fiancé Adam. When they started the project the couple aimed to give the outdated house a modern twist, whilst trying to stay in keeping with the current square shape. They wanted to convert the downstairs kitchen, bathroom and bedroom into an open plan kitchen and nursery as well as swapping out the rectangle windows in the living room to make the area appear more spacious and airy.Once the restoration was complete, Joanna shared the impressive before and after pictures to her Twitter and Instagram and explained: The ugliest house on the streetapos as quoted by a neighbour... Well, not anymore. It was an upside down house. Bathroom and  bedroom and that it was... The once red brick house was given a new lease of le with sleek grey and wooden , as well as two glass balconies overlooking the sea. She continued: We took the wall down between the two and added an extension into the garden. Which is now the kitchen. We changed the windows in the living room, from rectangle to square. The house itself was square so we worked with what we had keeping the theme of the house square but modern. After all this is a stepping stone to our forever home. So working with what we had was key.  We created a hallway which would lead into one master bedroom, a second bedroom and a shower room. And, a year later they even added an extra floor to the house, so that they had four bedrooms, two bathrooms and two balconies with sea views.  Joanna added: Another nursery and our new bedroom [added to that floor]. The original master bedroom below, with the built in wardrobes is now a dressing room. This has been finished very recently, still working on furnishing the main room. Sky light above the bed means perfect star gazing at night. The house was rendered. Wood added to balcony areas.

In New York, about  suspected cases of the inflammatory syndrome have been reported with more than half of the children affected aged about -. Medics say the syndrome is similar to Kawasaki disease - a rare inflammatory disease which mainly affects children under the age of five - and which has also been linked to the Covid- outbreak. Early in the pandemic, children were thought to be less likely to be affected by the deadly virus, which is hitting the elderly and vulnerable populations with underlying conditions around the world hardest. But doctors in the UK have also uncovered the new illness, which they describe as causing high temperatures, swelling and a red rash, and is serious enough to require immediate hospital treatment. At least three children are believed to have died from issues linked to the new and rare syndrome in New York, state Governor Andrew Cuomo told US news media. Hospitals in the UK have also been alerted to what experts describe as a “new phenomenon” linked to coronavirus after a cluster of cases in the capital. One child in England appears to have died from the mysterious illness, according to leading medical journal the Lancet.  The -year-old boy, who had no underlying health conditions, died at Evelina London Children’s Hospital in London. The child who died was one of two children who had tested positive for coronavirus. At least  children have now been treated for the “hyper-inflammatory” disease after potentially contracting Covid- at the specialist hospital. Of the first eight children, aged four to , who were treated at the Evelina - seven required the use of a ventilator. Four of the eight were living in households with a family member suspected or confirmed to have had the virus. Some children had severe abdominal pain and had undergone operations for suspected appendicitis.  Some had shock with low blood-pressure. The “cluster” of cases of the new illness is focused in the Woolwich and Southwark areas of the capital. Doctors at the Evelina said they had seen the first case of the inflammatory illness in children in around the middle of March, which is shortly before the UK went into lockdown. They children had symptoms that overlapped with Kawasaki, and displayed high persistent fevers, red eyes, rashes and swollen hands and feet. The phenomenon has left doctors in the US, Europe and the UK with unanswered questions about the apparently new condition, which can have serious effects on childrenaposs hearts.

I can’t get over this, historian Laurence De Cock, who posted the picture on Twitter, said. This image is heartbreaking. We can’t call this aposschoolapos.Lionel Top, a TV journalist with the BFM news channel, took the photo on Tuesday and said the children had been told to stay in their zones. To ensure respect for distances, while taking advantage of recreation, the teaching team drew squares on the ground for the little ones, he reported. The children play, dance, jump, laugh together ... but from this square. From what we have seen, they do not view it as a punishment. But other commentators expressed their sadness and anger at a scene which looked like it was out of a ‘horror film’. I’ve never seen such a sad picture, said Myriam Cau. It’s horrible to subject children to this. Lily, another Twitter user, wrote: Just inhuman, shameful for children but also for teachers and institutes! What horror !!!!.Others said it was like a scene from the Halloween series of slasher movies.And Antoine Diot commented: The picture of the children in the chalk squares will eventually illustrate this very strange situation in the history books. A spokesman for the Ministry of Education in Paris said there were no ‘specic instruction’ for teachers to draw chalk squares for their pupils. But he confirmed that everybody was under instruction to ‘maintain social distancing’ and not to share anything.

It is claimed he has instructed North Korean hacker group, Lazarus, to use phishing scams to steal cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The secretive syndicate rose to notoriety in  after hacking Sony Pictures in revenge for the planned-release of The Interview - a comedy about assassinating Kim Jong-un. Along with two other hacking groups, it stole mof cryptocurrency from five Asian exchanges between January  and September , a US government report revealed. Now with North Koreaaposs economy rocked by the coronavirus pandemic and international sanctions, Lazarus has embarked on a new spate of APTattacks. The APT group Lazarus, which is allegedly sponsored by a certain government, is increasingly engaging in cybercrime activities in and out of South Korea, said Seoul-based EST Security. The government-sponsored Lazarus organization is conducting major APT attacks not only in Korea, but also in the international community including the United States.

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/717515-1-548x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc juan sara manager","story":"Juan Sara was heartbroken when he left Dundee as a player in  – now he’s eyeing up aas manager.Dens Park gaffer James McPake shouldn’t be too concerned by that statement, however, as the South American is still working his way up the ranks in Argentine football.Currently assistant manager at second-tier promotion hopefuls Estudiantes de Buenos Aires, Sara has great memories of his time in dark blue and hopes toone day soon.In an exclusive interview with the Tele, Sara said: “Dundee is one of the most important clubs in my le.“I would love to go back to Dundee. People always show they loved this time and always remember it. I’ve always said we’d love to go back but it is not easy with football to do so.“I am coaching just now and I have a hope that one day, one of my dreams is to go to Europe and, hopefully, be Dundee manager.”Sara arrived in the city as the Bonetti era got into full swing at Dens Park  years ago, coming in alongside fellow Argentine Fabian Caballero to form a potent front line.Immediately, the striker felt at home in Scotland.Speaking from his home in Buenos Aires, he said: “I have great memories. The people were great, I felt at home in Dundee. It was really comfortable.“The people in the city were very friendly and I made a lot of friends in the team. There were a few Argentines and Italians as well as Scottish guys.“I had been playing in Paraguay and doing really well for a big team. I had the same agent as Fabian Caballero and Dundee were looking for a striker. I had the chance to go to Portugal but I chose Dundee because I wanted to play in the UK and the football there suited my style.“Playing with other Argentines made it easy and to have an Italian coach when I spoke Italian was great for me, too. It was the perfect place for me.“We started the season well, I scored goals and it went well. I was one of the top scorers in the league in my first season with  goals.“Straight away I noticed it was a physical game, tough football with long balls and the ball in the air but we tried to play another type of football. We tried to play with the ball on the grass and more combination football.“I really felt good in that team and the way we played.”Then a -year-old, Sara made a strong start to le in dark blue with three goals in his opening nine games before etching his name into Dundee history books with a derby hat-trick in a - win at Dens Park.“The hat-trick against United was one of my best moments,” he added.“At that time I didn’t realise what I had done! It was the first derby I played in, we won - and I scored all three. I don’t know how many times that will have happened.“People always remember that match. I didn’t realise how big it was. For the fans it was so important and I still get messages on facebook from Dundee fans about it!“I scored at Celtic Park, scored against Rangers and a lot of goals but I think the hat-trick against United was one I will always remember.“It was a fantastic atmosphere. It was amazing with the stadiums so close and to be able to walk down the street was a great experience.”As was the chance to play with one of his heroes, Claudio Caniggia, after the Argentina World Cup star arrived as replacement for injured Caballero.“It was a dream for me to play with Claudio,” said Sara. “I didn’t believe it when he signed!“He knew Ivano and Dario and when Fabian got injured they brought him to Dundee.“I couldn’t believe I would have the opportunity to play with him. Both being strikers, we played together up front and it was a dream for me.“He was so easy to play with but not just him – Fabian, Beto , Georgi , Gavin , there were so many good players.”Sara’s departure, however, was more nightmare than dream as the club tumbled into administration in .Ending on a sour note, however, doesn’t taint the Argentine’s memories.He said: “Leaving was disappointing. I really felt at home and to leave in the way we did was very dficult for us.“We lost a lot of money and were very upset. My we was pregnant at the time and it was dficult being in a dferent country with no job and no living. I didn’t know what to do. There were a lot of players in that situation.“However, it was one of the best times of my career, in Dundee.

If you had to have them it would be in a final, but the draw was kind to us with Raith.“They’d been doing well under John McGlynn but it gave us an opportunity to go to Hampden.“One of the things that sticks in my mind is we had the Sunday game but on Saturday, Ross County were playing Celtic.“We were going to the Westerwood Hotel in Cumbernauld to stay overnight.“We’d trained at Tannadice and headed down. I was off to Falkirk to watch them play St Mirren but Gary Kirk and Paul Hegarty went with the team on the bus.“I was listening to the radio all the way and about half-way down Ross County went one-up.“By the time I’m in the car park at Falkirk, Ross County score again with minutes to go to make it - and it really hit me then.“That was the first time I thought to myself, ‘There’s only three teams left and we’re now the favourites for the cup’.“I felt a bit of pressure going into the Raith Rovers game that we had to go out and do our business.“We were nervous but, thankfully, I had a group of players behind me who were magnicent and we beat Raith comfortably after a slow -minute start.”Although they were indeed favourites at that stage to go on and lt the cup, Houston insists that wasn’t always the case.The -year-old believes the Tangerines still had to do it the hard way in beating Partick, St Johnstone and champions Rangers after a replay to get their shot at Hampden glory.He continues: “A lot of people say Dundee United had it easy because we played Ross County in the final but they forget about the journey.“The fact is we had an away game at Partick Thistle then we were away to Premier League St Johnstone in the next round. That’s never an easy fixture.“We went down there and I remember Gary’s father had died during that week.“The players decided they wanted to wear black armbands and dedicated the win to Bobby Kirk, who was an ex-Hearts league and cup winner way back.“It was a nice gesture for the players, that’s the type of boys they were.“We went to Ibrox after that to play a strong Rangers side, who were the champions.“That was three in a row away from home in the Scottish Cup so we didn’t have an easy draw.“We were - down after Rangers got a couple of penalties, the usual at Ibrox, but to our credit we scored goals.“To see Andis Shala and Mihael Kovacevic on the scoresheet was something unusual. We got a wee break as well with wee Morgaro Gomis’ volley being deflected in.“They thought the game was won at -. They had downed tools a bit and the crowd was away to miss the traffic.“That set us up for our only home tie, the replay at Tannadice. That was a memorable game for the supporters.“The treble-buster, as he calls himself, David Robertson scored with his backside in the last minute.“That was the best thing for us because there wasn’t much time for Rangers to go and put up a comeback.“We were the better team and deserved to win.”United would see off Ross County in the final thanks to a second-half strike from David Goodwillie and a Craig Conway double.Nearly , Arabs rejoiced in watching on as Houston  Co climbed the steps to lt the Scottish Cup for the first time since .He continues: “It hits you when you’re walking out prior to kick-off and it’s just a sea of tangerine.“There were , Arabs there and that was a sight to behold. It’s so colourful.“A lot of people thought it wouldn’t be a good atmosphere because it was Dundee United and a smaller club like Ross County but to be fair to them I think Dingwall emptied for that day.“It was a busy final and the pressure was on us that we should win this cup.“There’s an added pressure there because you’re desperately keen to not mess it up for the fans.“The Saturday night and Sunday celebrations at Tannadice and City Square were amazing.“It’s something you can’t take away from that group of players and it will never leave my memory.”The celebrations would go on for days after but it is only now Houston looks back at their win as greatness achieved not bestowed.He credits predecessor Craig Levein for laying the foundations and admits there is a special sense of pride at achieving Scottish Cup glory, something the man who started it all, Jim McLean, couldn’t do.“As you get older you start asking yourself, ‘Where did those  years go to ’” he says.“It brought joy to a lot of United fans who’d only seen them win it once prior with Ivan Golac.“It felt surreal that Jim, who was the best manager of them all, hadn’t been able to get it over line with the amount of times he took United to Scottish Cup Finals.“It was great for me, personally, being the manager of United then and doing that.“The big thing for me was we had a brilliant group of players.“Craig and I had went in a few years before and he deserves credit as well. Him and I worked really hard building a new squad.“We were bottom of the league when we went in back in . Wee Eddie Thompson’s only words to Craig and I were, ‘Just keep my team in the top ision’.“We managed to finish ninth that season then fth for the next couple of years.“I was delighted that when I took over and Craig went away to be the Scotland manager we finished third, won the cup and went into Europe three years in a row.“It had been a long time for the club since it had been on that stage and they haven’t been since.“A lot of people forget that, yes we won the Scottish Cup, but we finished third behind a very strong Rangers and Celtic, and nine points ahead of Hibs.“It was a magnicent achievement and turned out a wonderful season.”Dundee United#s Scottish Cup-winning boss Peter Houston hopes Robbie Neilson can lead Terrors to Hampden triumph\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-peter-houston-robbie-neilson embed # secretIXeWqxySKj\" data-secret\"IXeWqxySKj\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  . Due to the current situation, applications for deferred entry and a further funded year have now been approved. Following the full, national implementation of the expansion of early learning and childcare, we will carry out a review of our wider policy on deferred entry.Thank you for reading this story.

said drive-thru restaurants such as McDonaldrsquos are ldquomade for social distancing.At the Downing Street press conference on Friday, George Eustice said it was safe for takeaway food shops to reopen.Many familiar high street chains including McDonaldrsquos, Greggs and KFC chose to shut their doors during the lockdown.What did the Environment Secretary say When asked about fast-food stores reopening, Mr Eustice said: ldquoI think our view is that probably a McDonaldrsquos drive-thru is made for the social distancing situation we are in, in that people do not leave their car, they place their order and someone passes a bag of food to them at the end through a kiosk.Unlike many other businesses, fast-food outlets were not mandated to close during the lockdown.Some chains have begun to reopenSome restaurants have begun the process of reopening, with KFC opening around  of its branches for delivery or drive-thru.McDonaldrsquos has conducted trials on reopening stores, with  restaurants opening for deliveries from next week.Askedoutlets could have stayed open during the crisis, Mr Eustice said: ldquoWhile clearly restaurants and pubs had to close, we were quite keen to keep that capacity to be able to do takeaway food for people.He suggested reduced footfall in town centres, staff anxiety and a sense of what was ldquosocially acceptable given the stay-at-home message had led to places such as McDonaldrsquos and KFC closing.Mr Eustice added: ldquoI think it is quite possible for these venues to reopen and reopen safely, we never mandated that they should close.ldquoI think some of those food-to-go businesses will probably be seeking to learn lessons from what supermarkets have done as they consider tentatively reopening.New safety measures have been introduced at food outletsBefore reopening, the McDonaldrsquos restaurants will be deep cleaned, while new safety measures will be introduced such as Perspex screens and floor markings.Staff will also receive protective equipment, such as non-medical grade face masks, and have their temperatures taken with ldquocontactless thermometers before shts.Earlier this month Greggs pulled back on plans to reopen its first sites to the public next week over fears it could attract crowds.The highly popular bakery chain announced it would carry out the opening trial behind closed doors over fears

but both shows couldto screens with older cast members absent and actors six feet apart, ITV boss Kevin Lygo has said.The director of television at the channel said he is anxious to get the soaps back into production because ldquoITV without soaps is barely ITV, adding: ldquoThey are terribly important to get back up and running.Speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival, which took place online this year, he said: ldquoThey are working really hard now as to how, when,and when restrictions are lted a bit, how can we make the soaps in a safe way.ldquoThey are being inventive and creative about

production lines.Are there more details on part-time s and can I take a job where The details will be published later this month, but Mr Sunak stressed to MPs that furloughed workers can take jobs where while on the scheme.Government advice says: ldquoIf your contract allows, you may undertake other employment while your current employer has placed you on furlough, and this will not affect the grant that they can claim under the scheme.However, staff cannot work for their employer while furloughed.Will the Government continue covering the cost The Government will fund the furlough scheme, which has supported seven million jobs at a cost of pound billion a month, until the end of July.After that, companies will be expected to make a contribution to the payments, although the amount workers take home will not fall below the  per cent mark.How much will businesses be expected to pay towards furlough The details will be published later this month, the Chancellor said, but it is likely to be judged on a sector-by-sector basis, similar to the details published on Monday by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategyfor companies looking to reopen under new

The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

Mr Johnson had barely finished before the whingeing and backbiting started. Mondayrsquos airwaves, from the BBCrsquos news output to the glossier breakfast shows, were full of little .He said lsquonothing was rightrsquo for everyone - too fast for some, too slow for others which was, in many ways, inevitable.ldquoBy its very nature, the virus has ided us by age, race, gender and even class, he added. ldquoIt has also shone an unsparing light on the fault lines running through our political culture. To take merely the most obvious example, it seems barely believable that while the British government has moved on to the lsquoStay alertrsquo message, the Scottish government vocerously refuses to do so.Sandbrook claimed it was in Nicola Sturgeonrsquos nature to lsquofoster ision and rancourrsquo and that much of the same could also be applied to Labour leader Keir Starmer.He admitted that we cannot rush out of lockdown but also have to bear in mind the damage being done to the economy.ldquoIf we are fractious and ided even before we set off, then the journey will be a thousand times more dficult, he said.Caroline Molloy said that after Boris Johnsonrsquos address on Sunday many felt ashe was sending blue collar workers to their deaths.ldquoEven before the lockdown started to fray, only half of workers were working from home, and one in four were still travelling to work, she pointed out. ldquoThere was a widespread impression, given by some vague and rather unscrutinised talk by government ministers, that only ldquokey workers were allowed, or required, to go to work. And that every part of the economy, bar the ldquoessential parts of it, had been ldquoclosed down. But neither of these things were true.She said there was no law laying down who could and couldnrsquot work and government messaging was now lsquocatching up with the current legal reality.rsquoldquoThose of us lucky enough to still be able to work from home are now realising how ugly that looks. Take the call centre workers reported on by openDemocracy, travelling by public transport to workplaces with crowding, air conditioning and even hot-desking, carrying out entirely non-essential work such as telesales.She said many workers felt terried and furious that they were told to go into work while being able to work from home.ldquoItrsquos now clear that that these gaps in the protection for workers continue into stage two of the Covid- response, and will affect ever more workers, she added. ldquoA government spokesperson told me there would be ldquoa number of legal cases after this is over, about whether bosses were right to make people go into work or not. But that will be too late for some.The Andrew Lane, chairman of the National Pharmacy Association, said the importance of testing has been key from the outset in a message reinforced by the WHO.He pointed out that countries like South Korea which had tested early had come out lsquorelatively unscathed.rsquoIn the UK, only frontline workers, carers and patients can access tests, he said.ldquoIt is clear that ramping up to mass testing would overwhelm the current infrastructure and that new capacity must be found, he said. ldquoThere is a ready-made delivery network for testing that reaches into every part of the country, and that has been stepping up to the plate since day one of this crisis. This is our , local pharmacies, the oft-forgotten part of the NHS frontline.He argued that the pharmacies could be the key to unlocking mass testing, providing home tests to those who need them and, in the long run, even administering a vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-funny-hopeful-in-it-together-poetry-livestream-help-us","story":"The aim, says current Makar, Jackie Kay, is, for the sixteen weeks of its run, to deliver something that feels like a live gig. ldquoI wanted to create some stay-at-home culture where it does feel interactive. I wanted to bring culture into peoplersquos living rooms and to have a sense of everybody doing it at the same time, because one of the things that has been happening a lot is that people have been pre-recording these cultural experiences and sometimes they can seem dead on arrival ndash but I wanted this to feel very live.Beginning on Thursday at pm, Kay will launch this series of online literary and musical performances, produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and streamed on its YouTube channel. In its mix will be not only readings and singing, but conversation about art and poetry, as well as the strange times we are going through and the struggles they bring. Kay, who will host, hopes they will offer ldquofood for the soul.Having lost her father, pre-lockdown, and struggled with not being able to see her mother who is in a care home, she acknowledges that, like many, she has found these times hard. ldquoIrsquove been traumatised by lots of things. The last time I saw my mum I had to persuade the home to let me in just to say goodbye. Hers was one of the first homes in the country to go into lockdown, on March , and though at the time it felt shocking it was definitely a wise move. I know two homes, near hers, that have had many die just in the last few days. Itrsquos terrying. I find it worse, this situation, having my mum in the home at this time, than my dad dying. I know that loss canrsquot really be measured in scales butI had to say what was the most dficult experience I would definitely say this is the most dficult experience ever.One of the things Kay want to do is ldquoaccompany people through these times. That accompanying is partly what we have a Makar for. Itrsquos one of the reasons we turn to poets, singers and artists. In times like these we need such voices. ldquoI feel itrsquos important, now, to accompany people, she says, ldquobecause I think that this particular crisis has turned the volume up. Kind people have got kinder, anxious people more anxious. Itrsquos showed the huge problems we have in our society already. Poor people are more likely to die quicker of this virus, BAME people are more likely to die quicker ndash so I just wanted to create something that takes note of our time but also offers something up to them.The series is curated by Kay and produced by the National Theatre of Scotland in association with HOME Manchester and Edinburgh International Book Festival and School of Arts and Media, Salford. The writers and musicians are being paid in an attempt to support artists during this dficult period. The commitment to the four-month stretch of the series is also an acknowledgement that we will not be ing to social gathering, theatre-going and the live arts experience any time soon. Most of the summerrsquos live events, including Edinburghs festivals, are already cancelled.ldquoI think, says Kay, ldquoeven when people start trying to put their heads out of the door, theyrsquoll want to pull their head right back in. People are not going to gather publicly for some time. I donrsquot think theatres are going to be open till January next year, at the earliest, and even when things do open, people will be wary about gathering in public groups.Many artists, she observes, are shting to trying to deliver their work online ndash and this may be increasingly the way of the future. ldquoWe all needed to be travelling less, flying less, and so perhaps some of these new formats are new formats for our times and point the way to cleaner air.Makar To Makar will be part of the flowering of creativity that has already been happening online. ldquoWe know,\" says Kay, \"from reading about all dferent crises throughout time, that people will turn to poetry and music. During the siege of Sarajevo, they had years of no water, no electricity, very little proper food, bombs going off, but they still managed to erect these theatres and people still managed to come out and see shows.\"The Covid- crisis, she notes, ldquohas been musicrsquos defining hour\". ldquoPeople have been touched by things like the Italians singing on their balcony.But whats missing with much online art is that sense of us all coming together in a moment of time, as we would around a live event. This is what Kay hopes to create. ldquoRight now wersquove lost our communality because wersquore not able to do communal things together, like go out and eat together or go to the theatre together, and it seems to me this is one way of bringing the communal back.\" What she wants, she says is to give people ldquosomething stimulating, hopeful, thought-provoking, funny, sad, a whole range of things ndash and that people will get a chance to experience it all together."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-face-heavy-price-society-going-pay","story":"If everyone in the UK stayed indoors until a vaccine or cure is discovered for Covid- there would be no deaths attributable to the disease. Fact. However, as soon as one person breaks that restriction, the odds change, by however small a degree. Fact. Multiply that one person by any number and the odds of transmission begin to shorten exponentially. Fact. The now infamous R number is just a reflection of those odds.The obvious conclusion, however unpalatable, is that any move whatsoever away from total isolation, in whatever set of circumstances in respect of social distancing, PPE equipment, hand washing, masks, and so on, will cause that R number to increase. And such a scenario will remain the case until a vaccine cure is produced. Fact.An obvious corollary of this is that the virus will spread, the population will become infected, people will die. Therefore, current strategies, however well-intentioned, are merely ways of seeming to be doing something positive when, in fact, denying the virological evidence from the scientic community. In other words, no matter what Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon tell us, without a vaccine, any loosening of current restrictions in the direction of \"opening up\" the country will, without doubt, lead to fatalities. Fact. Perhaps, as in any struggle, this a price society is willing to accept. Who knows However, the political, economical, social and personal cost of any measures are, of course, quite a dferent matter. But they will not, cannot, change the facts of this pandemics reproduction trajectory. It is said that we are \"at war\" with this disease and we know that people die in wars. Yet apparently the first casualty of war is truth. So maybe a sad dose of truthful reality might help us all to grasp, to deal with, but most vital of all, to cultivate the patience required to defeat the horror that is coronavirus.Gerard McCulloch, Saltcoats.SCIENCE is simply defined as a body of knowledge acquired by measurement, repeated measurement, precise measurement. Mathematics is considered Queen of Science.Scientists giving advice about Covid- management are unable to measure, with laboratory support, incidence or prevalence in the living community. A further dficulty arises in the deceased community due to lack of precisionof definition of cause of death. Certied involvementof Covid- in causing an iniduals death may be a scientic statement, with technicalsupport, but may be no more than a guess which may be plausible rather than credible.Politicians who lean upon scientists for advice must bear in mind that the quality of the advice given and received is no better than the reliability of the sources of the data utilised. Those who lack scientic training, such as politicians trained in law, may demonstrate excessive trust in what a scientist unwisely alleges. Unfortunately, at the present time many politicians are experienced only in politics and are vulnerable to charlatans.Dr William Durward, Bearsden.The BBC Disclosure programme quoted scientists whose modelling suggested that more than , Covid- deaths could have been preventedScotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier .However, for that to have happened Scotland would have needed to be a normal independent country in control of finance, welfare plus our borders and air transport rather than be wedded to a bumbling and shambolic Westminster Government.On January  Boris Johnson ignored the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March  dismissed the pandemic as not medically rational, which has resulted in the UK having the highest number of Covid- deaths per head of population in the world and trashed the UK economy with the loss of one million jobs.We donrsquot know whether Nicola Sturgeon received the same medical and scientic advice as Boris Johnson, but she has certainly handled the situation much better and been more straightforward with the public.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.NOT very long ago, Nicola Sturgeon told us that she would enter into a grown-up conversation with the Scottish public about coronavirus. So far it appears to consist of \"shut up and do what you are told\", but we can hope that it will eventually begin.When it does, a good start would be to be informed whether Scotland is to have its own Covid Alert Level, which seems to be a useful tool in the battle to get out of lockdown. Crucially, it also would allow us to come to our own conclusions as to whether the measures in place at any time are necessary and proportionate.Or does the First Minister not think we are grown up enough to handle such information Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrrecommends to readers that during the phased release from Covid lockdownyou happen to live in Scotland we should listen to Nicola Sturgeon for national guidance.If there is indeed statistical medical evidence justying Scotland following a dferent exit programme from England and indeed other nations within the UK, an obvious question is raised.Where does the argument for the issue being directed by local circumstance end  There are fairly obvious and rational reasons why pubs and restaurants in Scotland should all reopen at the same time. However.the fall in the rate of contagion is consistently and signicantly dferent across areas of Scotland perhaps it should be left to local authorities to decide, on the evidence, when their own schools should reopen.The latest results from the National Records of Scotland indicate that in terms of deaths involving Covid per , of the population, people residing in Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board areas are the worst hit by the virus. However Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are relatively least affected. I would suggest that schools in these three areas could reopen before the schools in very badly affected authorities such as Inverclyde.Bill Brown, Milngavie.NICOLA Sturgeon determines that Scotland requires dferent, more restrictive Covid- lockdown criteria to England because the circumstances are dferent. Fair enough, but that same logic applies to areas within Scotland, such as the islands, where virus cases have been relatively light.Somewhat ironically perhaps, the new English restrictions are more relevant to the present situation in Orkney than the Edinburgh-imposed ones.James Miller, Kirkwall.READING Guy Stenhouses articleI was not surprised by the points made, coming from the financial perspective as they did. They followed neatly on from the UK Prime Ministerrsquos broadcast on Sunday evening and pointed to the direction to be taken on the Monday.I was, however, shocked by its later tone and lack of empathy shown towards a workforce thrown back at short notice to an environment which may not be fully prepared for this and social issues arising such as childcare. It went on, it seemed, to weigh and to evaluate the limited contribution of those most vulnerable to the virus by stressing the lower death rates in younger people who could nowto work and contribute to economic recovery. It alluded to lestyle behaviours among some of these vulnerable groups and apportioned blame for the consequences of these in the current crisis to those suffering from drug and alcohol dependence and even cake consumption, presumably in light of the consequences of obesity.At a point in our history when the positives arise from the care and compassion of those caring for those affected by Covid-, be it in the NHS, care at home or in homes and by that section of the workforce still involved in food production and delivery and sales, plus our postal workers and refuse collectors and many others, often in jobs which are not highly paid, statistics only contribute to one part of the whole picture and to the decisions to be taken in these challenging times.Margo Biggs, Falkirk.MARIANNE Taylor bemoans the fact that tone of lockdown debates constantly needs ldquoto judge the motives of others within an ideological context . As I pointed out recently, we have had, for a decade in Scotland and for almost a similar period across the whole of the UK, political leaders who have made ideological causes the central plank of their drive for power, and the bedrock of their policies once in power. In doing so, they have fostered an atmosphere where binary, ideological argument is the order of the day.It can surely be of no surprise to Ms Taylor that almost every issue in UK politics is thus framed  If, when discussing garden centres, independence or Brexit, one side says black, itrsquos an absolute given that the other will say white.I fear this trend may continue for a generation.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.I WONDER what the UK Governments response will be when the country finally emerges from this horrendous period.

When it came to creating the menu there was a scene in the with Hagrid and Harry before the dragons arrived. The starter I created, Dragon of the Wood, was a venison tartare with celeriac remoulade and a smoked mayonnaise. I used wood sorrel and mushrooms as well - things you might associate with a walk in the woods.ldquoIn the heats the judges asked for more theatre so for the final the starter was presented to them after a fire-eating display.

He also asked ministersthe businesses case would be reappraised in light of the impact of COVID- on air travel. In response, the transport secretary, Michael Matheson confirmed that the business case will not be reviewed and that work to implement the strategy “will continue in parallel with work to prepare the IIA ” rather than be deferred.As part of his answer to Mr McArthur, Mr Matheson said good air connectivity will continue to be essential to support economic recovery in all parts of Scotland and that recovery will benefit from having more reliable and sustainable air services.#The main argument for the centralisation of the ATC services has been that modernisation was needed and the use of new technologies at the airports affected, which includes Kirkwall, would maker services more reliable.After receiving the responses, Mr McArthur said: “This is a remarkable assertion by the Transport Secretary, which shows a blatant disregard for the provisions of the Islands Act. If a major procurement process can be allowed to continue before any island impact assessment is completed, it rather suggests that ministers have little interest in what that assessment might conclude.“At a time when the future shape of air travel is so uncertain, at the very least Ministers and HIAL should be taking stock. Instead, both seem entirely happy to press on asnothing has happened.“No-one disputes the need for investment in modernising air traffic control services at airports across the region. Yet, plans to centralise services was always recognised as the most risky and costly of the options available.  In light of current restrictions, the island impact assessment offered the perfect opportunity to review this decision. “Sadly, the Scottish Government and HIAL have chosen to pass up that opportunity, while also doing little to inspire confidence amongst islanders about the value of the Islands Act”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters..."},{"url":null,"title":"convener this isnt the time for national leaders to be playing politics ","story":"That was the call from Shetland Islands Council convener Malcolm Bell after Prime Minister Boris Johnson adopted a dfering stance on exiting lockdown than his devolved counterparts, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.But Mr Bell believes there is little distance between the prime minister and first minister on how best to progress, at least once the political posturing between the two is taken out of the equation.National media reports highlighted dferences of opinion in the two leaders after Mr Johnson set out plans to mody the lockdown south of the border with a broadcast on Sunday evening.He fleshed out the details in the House of Commons on Monday, amid criticism that there was a lack of clarity about the message emanating from Westminster.Officials and elected representatives are eager to keep the “R” infection rate below one, which means each existing infection causes less than one new infection, meaning the disease will decline and eventually die out.: “There’s maybe not as much distance between the prime minister and the first minister as the language suggests. The dference appears to be largely in emphasis and timing.“But this isn’t the time for our national leaders to be playing politics. It’s critical that we have a clear message that people continue to follow the advice and guidelines.”The convener said he was not too concerned that dferent parts of the UK were thinking about the lockdown exit dferently.“In one sense everybody talks about ‘the science’. There’s no such thing as ‘the science’. There’s ‘science’, and as long as they’re taking their evidence from the same science it could be perfectly reasonable for dferent parts of the UK to go at a slightly dferent pace.“You can find a scientist to back up whatever you want. I’m concerned they are now going to start using this to emphasise political dferences. I think I would expect more from our leaders at a time of national emergency.”Mr Bell stressed people had to get back to work at some time, especiallythey wanted to preserve things like the “world-class health service” which they benefit from.He added that, when that time comes, #we do have to show the same sort of courage and commitment that our key workers at the moment – our health workers, bus drivers, ferry crews, care workers and shop assistants – are doing.”Following the prime minister’s address, residents in England will be able to carry out more outdoor exercise as of Wednesday.Mr Johnson also said primary schools south of the border may begin to re-open in June, as well as non-essential shops, while the hospitality industry could see operations begin again from July.He added people in England should be “actively encouraged” to go to workthey were unable to work from home.Mr Johnson said it would “soon be the time” to consider imposing a -day quarantine on people coming into the country by air.But the prime minister’s comments came as official data showed infections had risen in Germany, just days after the country eased its lockdown restrictions.Mr Johnson was criticised for his new “stay alert” message which he was advising in favour of keeping the “stay at home” dictum that has been the key message in tackling the virus head-on.Ms Sturgeon said the “core principles” of the lockdown measures remained in place, although she was willing to loosen restrictions enough to allow people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.She told journalists: “The objectives now for all of us must be to consolidate and solidy that progress. We mustn’t squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that make people think it’s okay to ease up.”She added: “Let me be very blunt about the consequenceswe were to do that. People will die unnecessarily, and instead of being able to loosen restrictions, hopefully in the near future, we will be faced instead with having to tighten them.“We must not take that risk.” raquoAnd any way I don#t thing we voted her inOnly way Shetland will get a world class health system ishe is planning to sell it to one of the Nordics# once lockdown ends the community will be back to fundraising for equipment, longer waiting lists due to lack of medical and dental services for months, commuting to mainland Scotland for treatment etc. Faroes had  deaths,  cases in care homes, is covid free and out of lockdown..."},{"url":null,"title":"vulnerable shetland families set to benefit from 104000 food funding ","story":"Struggling Shetland families are set to benefit from a six-figure government grant to provide food during the Covid- crisis.The SIC has received £, to help those normally in receipt of free school meals or clothing grants, who will receive regular payments as apart of the Scottish Government#s £ million Food Fund.

Timcheall na bliadhna ceithir cheud deug, ochdad ʼs a naoi , bha dithis bhràithrean còmhla ann an caisteal ann an Srath Àrdail. B’ iad Alasdair Liondsaidh, am mac a bu shine aig a’ cheann-chinnidh – Iarla Chrawford – agus a bhràthair, Iain.Chaidh na bràithrean a-mach air a chèile gu dubh. Thog iad buill-airm an aghaidh a chèile. Bha Alasdair air a leòn. Bha e na laighe san leabaidh an dèidh làimhe, feuch faighinn seachad air call fala, nuair a chuir a bhean cluasag air aodann airson a mhùchadh. Mura b’ e sin, bha daoine dhen bheachd gun robh e air tighinn beò.B’ i a bhean Seònaid Ghòrdan, nighean aig Seòras, Iarla Hunndaidh, agus a bhean Annabella, nighean aig Rìgh Seumas I.

of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere’s only so much looking at a blank page on screen that’s possible before you have to admitdefeat.In the absence of any golf, indeed any sports at all, and with a pledge to try not to add to the news and commentary around the Covid- crisis already made sometimes it’s very much a case of panic.So I decided to head off around the world.It’s easy.Even with nothing much flying, huge restrictions on general travel, and ‘lockdown’ still very much in evidence it’s still possible with a bit of imagination.Lots of things are.‘Around the World in  Trains’ by Monisha Rajesh is the kind of adventure that most of us probably, deep down, only dream about.The notion of giving everything up and heading off on a , mile journey by train, most of the time certainly not travelling first-class, with only the confidence of your publisher behind you, might terry most.The dference here being that Rajesh has a ‘track’ record hereand already had managed ‘Around India in  Trains’ to considerable acclaim.The ‘gamble’ wasn’t so much that everything hinged on the possibility of a book-deal, that the house might have to be sold to pay for the trip, or that anything could go possibly wrong: this was the sort of adventure that comes with the kind of safety net that wannabe travel writers might only care to dream about.The ‘gamble’ was a sure thing.The best kind.She loves train travel.She knows she already possesses a charming style and wit .She is fearless, adventurous, resourceful and confident.She probably had the advance in the bank and a Bloomsbury credit card tucked away somewhere safe.She took her fiancé to sell for body parts, just in case.The bases were covered.But it didn’t feel like that and, despite being incredibly jealous, you easily get sucked into her world of ‘roughing it’ amongst strange farts, loud snores, despicable train ‘etiquette’, and uncomfortable travel bedfellows, depending on which rails you are traversing.These strange times provide a unique opportunity for those of us who, luckily, can get lost inside their own heads.Days of reading and Netflix, YouTube documentaries and Sky box sets can keep the madness at bay whilst you head into the sixth straight week of nightsht.That and doing the lottery.You can disappear, both into your own and somebody ’s fantasy adventures, safe in the knowledge that you will never have the cojones to even challenge yourself to anything more dangerous than a co-op ‘seafood selection’ a couple of days beyond its ‘best before’ date, nor less basic than a -star hotel in exotic, far-flung, hot-spots like Cyprus or Tenere .I find myself vicariously earthy and ‘real’ eating a ‘three squeaks’ aperit after haggling with a one-legged hawker on a street corner, before hitting the hay for the fth consecutive night with a fellow traveller who now smells sweetly ripe, despite washing his feet where I shave.I’m adventurous, but only in my own head.I can yearn for the real, authentic, deal, but would probably settle for a ‘Westworld’ or ‘Total Recall’ futuristic implant.I could pack it in and head for the opal depletedmines of Coober Pedy, or the aptly named Opalton in Australia.Following in the footsteps, and bore holes, of prospectors who either struck it rich or went broke trying I’m there with the jack-hammer, just praying for a glint of green.Sold the Mondeo and the golf clubs, bought my claim and a second-hand excavator, and will surely strike it rich where every other damned fool either failed or moved on.Claiming a redundant, abandoned, dangerous, tunnel to the centre of the earth is the stuff of the original ‘ers.Except they’d have got there first.I’d make a great Outback Opal Hunter: I’ve got the Drizabone hat, with corks, and am getting used to working in the dark with headlights.Maybe I’ll start digging around in the shed and see what I could find to take to auction.Become a Pawnstar or Auction Hunter, rather than just ‘flogging it’, whatever ‘it’ turns out to be, for a £.I’ll head to Vegas, spin Chumlee a great line about my cousin Donald, and cash in on the great-great-grandmother.Memo to self: check the lineage and silence Bill Lawson.Ach, I might even disappear up to Dutch Harbour for a while and see what the fishing’s like with my old pal, Sig Hansen on the ‘Northwestern’.The Barents Sea looks like a doddle compared to Broad Bay, although the weather might require an extra pair of Damart.I might watch Ricky Gervais’ ‘After Le’ again the first time was a bit ‘misty’ in parts.I recommend it to you.In between I’ll do the odd lottery, online naturally, just to add to the suspense when I get ‘lucky’.Lucky is a relative term.The ‘congratulations, you have a winning ticket’ email is one of the tricks le likes to play on us all in its huge panoply of crushing disappointments, dressed up full of promise.I like to leave it a while before checking, spending the £ million carefully, ensuring the family are sorted before I buy my own train.The accumulated £. may require pooling.I won’t let any win ruin my positive, cheerful, disposition.When it comes to big numbers, the latest book, Matt Parker’s ‘Humble Pi’ doesn’t take long to leave you whistling at how unprepared you were to comprehend something as ‘small’ as a trillion.He was asked once to go onto tv to explain when the UK national debt crept up to this figure.Can#t be far past a billion, right Wrong!He explained it thus.A million seconds is nearly  days.A billion seconds is nearly  years.Ok, so now you’re in the ‘ballpark’, aren’t you Nah.A trillion seconds would take us all to the year .Yup,  years into the future.So how long to the end of the lockdown and ‘things’ get back to what’s being called the ‘new normal’ As long as it takes to guarantee the safety of each and every one of us, especially the most vulnerable, should be the answer, but these are strange times.Don’t count the seconds.Count the sunny days and savour each and every one of them.And yes, I know it’s probably snowing this weekend.It’s peat-cutting season.I wasn’t going to mention the coronavirus crisis, but unfortunately it’s caught up with us in a very real and devastating way.No amount of books, tv and fantasy can hide us from harsh reality.It’s nice to digress, but my thoughts are with the families affected in Skye.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

carried out.Highland Labour MSP Rhoda Grant has asked NHS Highland to start daily testing of all staff and residents at Home Farm.In an email to NHS Highland interim chief executive Paul Hawkins, Mrs Grant also urged that concerns over staff movements at the home should be investigated.Mrs Grant has asked Mr Hawkins: “Did the health board know whether staff had been tested before they were moved in, and whether any contact tracing of staff had taken place to ensure staff brought in were not coming from other homes where patients had tested positive for the infectious disease ” reports.Mrs Grant has called on Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to disclose how all separate bits of government advice had been passed on to care homes by the Scottish Government.She added: “I understand the Home Farm Care Home has weak ratings with regard to infection control – was it identied by Health Protection Scotland as one which might need special attention or guidance before the outbreak occurred  If this is the case, what additional action was taken to protect residents ”Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Donald Cameron echoed calls for extra testing.He said: “The focus must be on testing care home workers to reassure them that they are free of the disease and to minimise the chances of care homes being infected.“It’s a sad fact that the proportion of deaths from Covid- in care settings in Scotland has been high and, as testing here has been carried out at a relatively low rate, it is right that there should be a great national effort to improve matters.“I believe it would also help to instil confidencethe number of care workers tested was published regularly and I hope that the Scottish Government starts doing that on a more regular basis.”Meanwhile, Skye councillors are urging NHS

come back for Budhmor and An Acarsaid showing no cases of Coronavirus in these homes at this time.“We need regular updates so that we and the wider community, who have been so supportive right across the island in responding Covid , receive the honesty and transparency we deserve so that we can all understand what is going on.Councillor John Gordon praised the courageous and kind service that the

from Shieldaig Primary School and nursery have brought a ray of sunshine to the local area by creating artworks in support of frontline workers and the most vulnerable members of the community.Thanks to a grant of £ from the North Highland Initiative, local group Shieldaig Coronavirus Community Support was able to provide arts and crafts activity packs to the  children from the local primary and nursery.Shieldaig Coronavirus Community Support is run by the five members of the Shieldaig Community Council in tandem with a resilience team of  volunteers who operate in dferent areas of the village.Natalya Revitt who chairs the Shieldaig Community Council, told the Free Press that the idea for the arts and crafts packs came about to help local children and their parents during challenging times. She said: #As the weeks of lockdown passed it became clear to us that the children in our village were finding isolation particularly hard, as were their parents.“We wanted to provide something for the children to do that would give them, and their parents, a break from the same routine.“As part of the packs, we also worked with Julia Boger, the Shielding Primary School teacher, and set little tasks for the children to do using their new arts and crafts packs.“These include writing a letter to, or drawing a picture for, an elderly or vulnerable person in our community, colouring a poster to thank all our postmen and women, bin men, delivery drivers, shop staff, NHS, and key workers, and completing a Covid- time capsule workbook which will be included in the village record of how Shieldaig community came together to protect and help each other during this pandemic.#She added: #Not to leave out our older young people, we also provided an Amazon voucher to each of the teenagers in our village which were very warmly received.#In addition to securing a grant for the arts and crafts sets, the community council members have successfully applied for over £, of funding to help provide fuel assistance grants, weekly care packages of essential groceries, household items, and compost and seed potatoes for anyone who has started to grow their own food.The community support group has also created a thank you banner for the local GP surgery, delivered random acts of kindness to anyone nominated in the village, and will this week launch its latest project # The Grub Hub.The Grub Hub is a new community food cupboard open to anyone living in Shieldaig and along the Applecross Peninsula.Built by a local joiner Keith McNicholl, The Grub Hub will be located outside the village hall and will be stocked with non-perishable groceries and household items.The simple message to the community when using The Grub Hub is, #give what you can, take what you need#.Ms Revitt, who become Shieldaig Community Council Chair just days before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK-wide lockdown, added: #With just five members on our community council, who were only elected in February, and met for the first time on th March , we are very proud of how much we have achieved so far to help our community.#The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dachaidh-c-1.jpg","title":"an t am coimhead as deidh ar seann daoine gu","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTha e air a bhith còrdadh rium bhith dèanamh sreath fon ainm ‘An t-Seachdain seo ann an Eachdraidh’ do BhBC Rèidio nan Gàidheal, oir chan eil seachdain air a dhol seachad nach d’fhuair mi grunn rudan a bha mi air diochuimhneachadh mu dheidhinn, no nach robh mi air cluinntinn mu dheidhinn, agus a tha làn airidh air an cuimhneachadh.An t-seachdain seo fhèin, mar eisimpleir, Murt na h-Apainne ann an  agus mar a thàinig Rudolph Hess a dh’Alba air itealan agus an uairsin parachute gu talamh ann an .Sgeul iongantach.Bha ùidh agam riamh ann an Eachdraidh: saoilidh mi gun tàinig sin bhon sgoil, oir bha am Maighstir Sgoile a bh’ agam ann an Sgoil Ghearraidh na Mòineadh ga dhèanamh gu math tarraingeach – ged is dòcha gun robh barrachd ùidh aige fhèin ann an Geography, no Cruinn-Eòlas, mar a their iad ris an-diugh!Co-dhiù, b’anns an sgoil bhig sin a dh’ionnsaich mi an Clàr-Eachdraidh ainmeil a bha tòiseachadh le #

Corona is incubated in the wider community.There are certain places where you do not want the virus to end up, because the death rates are bound to be very highit gets in there, and care homes are the most dangerous place of all.The failing in this case lies in the lack of oversight within Scotland, andwe are to learn anything from this, it is important that responsibility is fully and accurately apportioned.The Scottish Government have tried to say that care home owners themselves have been negligent.If this is the case, then anyone catching the virus since the outset must also be in some way negligent, orthey contracted it in a public institution, then it must have been negligent.Such is the downward spiral that arises when government chooses not to look at itself but wants to find some-one  to blame., Aberfeldy I would like to remind all reporters that Home Farm was a particular home at risk due to its persistent failure in even basic Infection Control Procedures.This has been evident since November . Their last inspection gave them a grade of  Where were the NHS and Social Services staff in making sure this home improved to an acceptable level before the outbreak  in relation to the horric impact the virus has had with a nursing home in Skye.I#m a little confused by some of your assertions, that suggest the UK Government are responsible.The National Health Service is  per cent devolved in Scotland and the private health care of nursing homes come under the regulation of the Scottish Government.Surely your points would be better addressed to the Scottish Government who are responsible and accountable for the support of care homes during this pandemic Kindly note that the SNP administration have admitted that patients were sent to care homes without the results of the Cov- tests being known.Ms Freeman was interviewed early by the BBC and admitted this point. It is also worth noting that the SNP have stated care homes will pay for the non-standard PPE issued by the Scottish Government.Not something I believe is entirely reasonable, given this being a global pandemic and the regulations enforced by the Government.Rest assured, our thoughts are with the victims of this horric virus. I hope accountability is aligned to where it resides here in Scotland. re Home Farm Nursing Home is not only inaccurate it is totally biased.I have a simple question for you#. the SNP and that woman Sturgeon are not responsible for anything why then do we need them So no doubt you will give them credit without hesitation but when truth and correct fact is required you cannot bring yourself to name and shame and there is indeed plenty to shame them for , including this.Perhaps your reporting needs closer scrutiny in future.I am disabled and use a rollator to get around. On Thursday last week I hurt my back and couldn#t walk even with the rollator.I needed to buy some food but discovered the co-op doesn#t do home delivery. They used to, but not anymore.I tried Skye community response and they put me on to the warehouse which is mainly vegetables.I found there was nowhere to turn to and was getting exasperated. Along with the pain it wasn#t doing me any good.My doctor suggested I increase the morphine that I#m already on to seethat helps.I#m angry that there is no help for people like me.The co-op could easily do home delivery. I don#t know why they don#t.The co-op could allow disabled people to go straight in and not stand in a queue and I mean disabled people # not the ones who can walk perfectly with a walking stick and have somehow managed to get a blue badge .There should be something in place to help people like me without having to go through reams of red tape.Meanwhile I#m just about out of bread and milk andit wasn#t for the kind actions of a neighbour I would be stuffed.Why isn#t there something in place for these who find themselves in a situation like mine. Andthere is then why is it being kept a secret last week reminded me that about  years ago, as part of the Their Past Your Future project, the Museum of the Isles at Clan Donald and the Archive Service in Portree collaborated on an oral history project relating to the second world war in Skye.One of the outcomes was a book The Crofters and the War, using excerpts from the many hours of recordings that were made, mainly by Mary Carmichael who was the project officer.The book included a chapter on the surrender. There were quotes from Annie MacLean of Raasay, and from Ruth Coghill, Vi Beaton, and Mary Black, who all remembered seeing the surrender, as well as a photo of German sailors at Kyle station which is in the Archive service collections.I seem to remember that Mary Carmichael located a film of part of the surrender, as I remember watching it, but I am afraid I can#t remember where it originated # maybe the Imperial War museum, maybe the Scottish Film Archive.There were probably many other references to submarine activity and the end of the war where in the book, and also in the actual recordings.I can#t remember whether both the Museum and the Archive service kept copies of the recordings, or whether it was just one of them.Every contributor got a copy of the book, as did local schools, and it was also for sale so you may have come across a copy. The museum at Armadale still have a few copies I think.Finally, thank you for keeping us informed online during this lockdown.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lockdown-pic.jpg","title":"news round up isles virus testing lockdown guidance and lifeboat call","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn line with Scottish Government policy, NHS Western Isles has this week started a new long-term approach to addressing COVID-, known as Test, Trace, Isolate, and Support.The principles of this approach are to:NHS Western Isles Chief Executive Gordon Jamieson welcomed this new approach.He said: “The Test, Trace, Isolate and Support approach is at this point our best chance of suppressing and preventing transmission of the Covid- virus.

He#s down there six nights of the week, has his half a dozen drams and gets a taxi home. He#s loved by regulars and visitors alike.#Everyone takes him under their wing # he#s a lovely man.#He took a turn after the new year and lost his confidence and ended up in a nursing home in Strontian. He then came back to Skye and went to Home Farm.“I contact him every Saturday to have a blether with him, but then Coronavirus struck.#However, I phoned and his nurse and carer said he was doing well. I then spoke to Norman and was chatting about this that and the other and said ‘you#ll be missing your mackerel and herring’, and he said #I#d rather mackerel’.#Norman#s request quickly sent his peers from the Pier into action and what would soon become known as ‘Operation Mackerel’ was up and running.#I put a blog up on the Pier Hotel Facebook page where I update people about how Norman#s doing,# said Sandy.#I mentioned that he was missing a bit of mackerel and the next thing I know I had several offers of mackerel from the village here all the way up to Uig.#I contacted Home Farm to seethey would accept some mackerel coming into the home for Norman and they said it would be no problem at all.#I expected two or three mackerel but Gordon McCririck gave me  fillets courtesy of Just Hooked fishmongers to take up to the home.#Sandy added: #Lo and behold I came home to see a photo of Norman tucking into his two mackerel and potatoes on Facebook.“It delighted a great number of people from the Pier Hotel to see Norman looking so well and sitting having what he asked for – and all thanks to the generosity of Gordon McCririck and Just Hooked.#Speaking to the Free Press, Norman#s niece Christina MacTaggart said: #The old man was absolutely delighted.“The nurse that has been looking after him has been fantastic, she took a fantastic photo of him and I had to share it with the ones from the Pier Hotel.#We had his th birthday party down at the Pier last year. I came up from Oban and when I walked in the place was absolutely bouncing.“It just showed how well thought of he is.“The staff and the customers there are like his family, they all look after him # I get up to Skye as much as I possibly can but they are fantastic with him.#Commenting on the love and care her uncle has received, she said: #He always wanted to come back to Portree.“He#s as happy as Larry there. The staff that have been looking after him have been absolutely amazing # because I am in Oban they have been an absolute god-send to me.“They keep me well informed, let me Facetime him so we can speak.#The girl looking after him # Claire is her name # she has gone beyond the call of duty and been brilliant.#He is in the home, and although all this has happened, it hasn#t changed our mind in any way or made us want him to be anywhere .#The staff have been risking their own lives and in a small community, it just makes it so much harder.”While Norman#s love of fish is well known, according to his great-niece, there is perhaps another key ingredient to his longevity.Christina explained: #My -year-old daughter was asked to talk at school about someone who inspired her and she told the class #my uncle from Skye, he has reached .

Michael McAdam said it was dangerous to mix sport and cinemas under the leisure banner, as each is dferent in its own right.The Executive launched its roadmap out of lockdown on Tuesday and under #sport, cultural and leisure activities#, leisure centres and other indoor leisure facilities, including cinemas, could open at stage four of the plan.Mr McAdam felt it was wrong to categorise every business and believes the decision on whether they should reopen or not should be judged on an inidual basis.It#s up to each of us who operate a business to convince those who make the decisions how we can operate our businesses. I think it#s wrong that every business is categorised, he said.It#s not just from a selfish business perspective, but I think it#s important for people to see something happening.In stage one, four to six people can meet up, but where are they going to go and what are they going to do Unless there#s going to be something that people can go to, I think people are going to become very depressed.In an effort to prepare his cinemas for reopening, Mr McAdam has installed sneeze guards at tills and ordered temperature scanners from China. He has also updated the chain#s software so customers can only buy tickets online, which will automatically keep patrons away from each other inside the screens.It#s all about trying to reassure customers.All in all, we have been looking at this the whole way through and even how we are going to get people to leave the cinema, he said.Speaking later on BBC Radio Ulster#s Evening Extra, Mr McAdam was asked about the feasibility of drive-in cinemas.When we knew the lockdown was coming I was investigating this, particularly at the Jet Centre complex in Coleraine.

Speaking to the committee, Mr Roberts said: The plan is progress, but we believe that there needs to be clear and indicative timings and dates in that plan.The recovery plan for the Republic has a target date of June for the reopening of non-essential shops - and we believe that is achievable for Northern Ireland, but we will also need appropriate childcare provision.He said footfall in towns and cities in Northern Ireland had all but collapsed during lockdown.It is now time for Executive to work on a reopening plan for towns and cities. He said such measures would mean provisions such as stewarding and cleaning would have to be put in place, and new arrangements made for car parking and public transport. But he added: It would start the ball rolling and preparation would now begin for reopening our economy in a safe way.Aodhan Connolly, NI director of the NI Retail Consortium, said the pandemic had ushered in the worst crisis for the sector in some time.Covid- is the biggest external factor to affect our business and consumers in generations. Retail has already had signicant challenges and a huge change, with more transformation over the last five years than in the previous .And he said that while the perception was that the pandemic had ushered in a boom period for grocers, that had not been the case.Sales were up % in the first part of March while people stockpiled even though there was really no need. But what they were stocking up on was the lower-profit margin, cheaper goods like cheaper toilet rolls, cheaper proteins and cuts of meat. Then in the second half of the month we had the lowest sales figures since .The committee also heard evidence on the plight of small businesses from executives in Enterprise NI and InterTradeIreland.Michael McQuillan, chief executive of Enterprise NI - which represents  enterprise agencies around Northern Ireland - said firms should receive grant aid to help them implement changes in the workplace to adhere to social distancing. Small businesses are having to put in screening to protect staff, as well as providing hand sanitiser and developing one-way systems within their premises, he said. We think firms should be able to benefit from a grant of say £, or £, to pay for equipment to make your workplace safe.Also addressing the committee, Aidan Gough, designated officer and director of strategy and policy at cross-border body InterTradeIreland, said the Government would have a part to play in economic recovery as well as in keeping companies going through the crisis. Large infrastructure programmes that are being planned should be brought forward as quickly as possible to help stimulate demand within the economy.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She added: We will of course look at the detail, but at first glance it will give help and certainty to employers around Northern Ireland.Ann McGregor, chief executive of the NI Chamber, said the extension was a welcome move. Over the coming months, the Government should continue to listen to business and evolve the scheme in line with what#s happening within the business environment, she said.Further support may yet be needed for companies who are unable to operate for an extended period, or those who face reduced capacity or demand due to ongoing restrictions.Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs that from August there will be greater flexibility to allow furloughed staff to begin ing to work.Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time, he said. And we will ask employers to start sharing with the Government the cost of paying people#s salaries. Under the scheme - which has already cost the taxpayer £bn - staff will continue to receive the current level of support through a combination of state and employer contributions. Details will be announced at the end of the month following consultations with business, but officials have acknowledged the state will continue to make the largest contribution. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said: It will be a relief to many of our members and the wider business community that the Chancellor has extended the scheme.Stressing the need for flexibility, South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said: While we await more detail, it is very welcome that workers will continue to receive %, at minimum, of their salary. While this is a very positive announcement and will provide clarity and relief to many across Northern Ireland, it is important that the UK government will be flexible with people and businesses, and to reflect the #phasing back# and part time working that many businesses will require, to ensure they we don#t face a new clf edge in October.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said further detail was needed on how it will operate from the summer.Meanwhile, Mr Sunak has said he is looking at the best thing to do with the coronavirus self-employment income support scheme. He was asked in a BBC interviewhe would extend the scheme enabling the self-employed to claim a taxable grant of % of their average monthly trading profits, up to a cap. He said: We#re looking at the best thing to do but ... the reason for that is slightly dferent in that many of those self-employed people are not in sectors which are necessarily closed or have an employer who has reduced their hours. It is a slightly dferent scheme which I was clear about at the beginning, but what I would say to those people, millions of those people who are eligible, ahead of schedule the scheme is now open, they can apply this week, they#ll be getting the emails and they will have the same amount of support based on their historical earnings ... by the end of the month.

The well-known local politician died after a period of illness. Observing social distancing, many lined the roads leading to St Mary’s Church, Drumagarner as the cortege made its way into a church that parish priest John Cargan said should be full. Many of his party colleagues were not able to attend due to the Covid- regulations and instead posted tributes online. John was hugely admired and respected throughout the community in East Derry over the course of his -year political career. googletag.cmd.push He became the first nationalist mayor of the old Coleraine Council in  and won the respect of fellow councillors with his forthright determination. SDLP councillors on the current Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where his daughter Helena serves, expressed their sadness at his passing. They said: “We have been privileged to have John as our mentor and role model. John worked tirelessly for everyone in our community and fought for justice for many. “He was a well-respected politician with very strong values and will be sadly missed by each and every one of us. “Our thoughts and prayers go to our colleague Helena her mum Anne and brothers Ronan and Diarmuid and the wider family circle.” googletag.cmd.push A teacher by trade, he taught at St Paul’s College in Kilrea for  years before being elected to serve in the Northern Ireland Assembly in . His commitment to the community was steadfast and he is widely credited with rejuvenating the Kilrea, Rasharkin and Dunloy Credit Union, which was in danger of closing. John was a champion for the underdog, something he said was ‘second nature’ to him while growing up. When a young African student was due to be deported after her visa had run out, he took her into the family home and supported her in extending her stay for a further two years. He was dogged in his pursuit of justice for what he described as the ‘dreadful murder’ of Inga-Maria Hauser, the German backpacker whose body was found in a remote part of Ballypatrick Forest, near Ballycastle, Co Antrim. When the family announced they would no longer be ing to mark her anniversary, John took up the mantle of remembering her every year at the forest park. John held the post of Deputy Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly for ten years and also served on the Public Accounts Committee with what Colum Eastwood described as ‘forensic skill’. “As a public representative, John struck fear into the heart of anyone who dared misspend a penny of public money,” said the SDLP leader. “I know I speak for everyone in the party when I say his good humour and wise advice will be sorely missed.” Following his death, tributes were paid across the political spectrum. First Minister Arlene Foster said he was ‘always to the fore in speaking up for his constituents’. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill also expressed condolences, saying she was a ‘pleasant and witty man’, while Alliance leader Naomi Long said his death was a ‘genuine loss’. UUP MLA and Deputy Speaker Roy Beggs said he spoke for all the assembly when he said John would be ‘sorely missed’. Family was fiercely important to John and Fr Cargan told his funeral that, despite the pressures he encountered, he never allowed it to affect them. He said: “He encountered those who preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil. “These threats put his family le under immense strain and it is to his credit that he never allowed this pressure to diminish the equality of le enjoyed by the family.” John’s family said they had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the volume of the support they had received following his death. They said: “We would like to express sincere gratitude to the many people who have provided comfort to our family at this sad time. “We wish to thank the hundreds of local people who observed social distancing and lined the route of the funeral cortege to St Mary’s, Drumagarner, Kilrea. There are no words to adequately describe how moved we were. “These are unkind circumstances to lay anyone you love to rest but so many people made it a lot easier and more dignied than it could have been. “We have been overwhelmed at the volume of calls, messages, social media posts and touching tributes to him. We thank everyone for taking the time to express condolences and for sharing memories and anecdotes. “We are indebted to the dedicated healthcare workers. We will be eternally grateful to so many incredible people for their support, in particular, Ciara our amazing NI Hospice nurse, our GP Dr McCormack, consultants Dr Stewart  Dr Mullan from the NW Cancer Centre and Dr Diamond from the Mater. “Our selfless district nurses who provided craic as well as first-class treatment, the very appropriately named “carers” and the Marie Curie nurses. All of them somehow make each family in their care feel like they are their only priority. “He put up one of the bravest and most humbling fights, in much the same courageous, tenacious way that he lived his le. We are filled with pride at the number of people he has touched.” Described by Fr Cargan as a ‘man of light’, John Dallat’s determination and passion for helping others has left a lasting imprint on the community in East Derry and on all who knew him.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

See Around Britain has built up a large gallery of photographs from venues across Britain, Ireland and Europe and is covering County Derry with the help of local volunteers. Chloeacute Taylor, who lives in Dungiven, is one of those who has been helping the service to improve accessibility to venues locally. “It allows people, especially those with an impairment, who might be worried about going out to go and view a place or go to a beach, or a library or museum,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “It gives them the descriptions and accessibility descriptions which is important in this day and age. It helps people that I know to go and get out of the house, and be more included. “I help with the social media side of things, producing content and bringing it to a wider audience. “I also help with venue descriptions for the website and take pictures of areas where I live and where I’m from. Originally from the West Midlands in England, Chloeacute has visited many places across the UK and Ireland, but things have slowed a little with the Covid- pandemic. She said: “Visiting places has become more dficult because you can’t really go too far with the requirements of the lockdown, but I am someone who takes a lot of pictures anyway. googletag.cmd.push “I have a lot saved from areas that I can use up and you can find the information quite easily, so it’s not a huge problem.” See Around Britain was formed in  by Marg McNiel, who has taken over , photos to help others with what to expect when they travel to a new venue. Marg suffers from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a neurological disease that affects all body systems and something he describes as feeling ‘constantly jetlagged’. The organisation is always on the lookout for more volunteers to increase their coverage of venues. “We have tried to do a comprehensive listing of Derry, not just the tourist sites,” he said. “We urgently need online volunteers that can sign up via our website. We think this will particularly help people during the current lockdown as they can use their talents or skills. “I aim to give skeleton coverage for more people to add to. It can include everyday things like pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, libraries, post offices and other shops. “Seeing is believing. It will help older people, people with impairments, or anyone really to know what to expect.” Much of the Marg’s early surveys were conducted from one of his three Morris Minor vans, which he admits are not in the best condition at the minute. “The last one had to be taken off the road in  because its chassis could no longer be patched to get it through an MOT,” he said. “There was nowhere to garage them undercover. The plan, as soon as we get them undercover, is to cut out the rust and replace it with steel  where necessary. “We want to convert them to electric motors because our present base is only rented and we plan to get a permanent base on a rural farm.” The vans will be used to ferry archives from the organisation’s current base when they source a new venue, but as with many projects, funding is proving to be an issue. He said: “We launched the website and its apps, which are free to download, in  and we’ve been building on it ever since. Each month it costs about pound,. “It’s hard getting revenue funding. You can get some through crowdfunding, but unless you’re like Captain Tom, it’s very hard. You have to have a high profile. “It’s very hard to get private sponsors, particularly because with the virus, most of the economy will be in deep recession. We’ve been trying to contact the actor Michael Sheen to help raise our profile. “Unless you provide something to help economic and social regeneration and we can play a vital role. “If people could see the worth of what we are doing, we could get a lot more volunteers and eventually, financial support.” “We’re trying to link up with an initiative in the Republic called Age Friendly Ireland. It was started by the former Chief Executive of Cavan County Council. “The Irish government has given funding for the Age Friendly Ireland offices in every county council as well as access and tourism officers. “We are trying to work with them to get a track record so we can go to the Ireland and Northern Ireland governments.” Volunteer Chloeacute also feels that the organisation could benefit so manyit received the right financial backing. “Disability also impacts on mental health and I definitely feel that government funding should be helping people to help others,” she said. “There is such a stigma surrounding disability and mental health, even now, and there shouldn’t be.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

The monthly Mayors tea dances at the Guildhall have been a highlight of their social calendar for many people in recent years. However, as with so many other events, the dances were cancelled because of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. While it will not be as a good as the real thing, an alternative tea dance will take place tomorrow afternoon. Mayor, Michaela Boyle, and her team are linking up with the Mark Patterson Show on Radio Foyle to create a special live virtual tea dance from pm to pm. googletag.cmd.push The show will feature music from local band Midnight Sun. Derry City and Strabane District Council will be providing a digital archive of some fascinating pieces from the Tower Museums Showbands Exhibition featuring old photos and stories from back in the day. There will be the opportunity to hear from someteadanceregulars, and listeners can phone in to share their stories and memories. Councillor Boyle said she was really looking forward to catching up with some of theteadanceregulars. Theteadancesare one of my favourite events and they have a dedicated following of lively members of the older generation who would put us all to shame with their energy and vitality. googletag.cmd.push This is a very dficult time for everyone – particularly older citizens – many of whom will be shielding at home, and perhaps feeling more isolated from family and friends. I wanted to do something positive to cheer people up by capturing some of the fun and memories from previous events, and reminding them that we will see ato normality and many moreteadancesto come.” BBC Radio Foyle ContentEditor Larry Deeney said they were delighted to be able to reach out through the show. The Mark Patterson programme draws listeners of every generation and when the council mentioned they were hoping to broadcast theteadancewe thought the show would be the perfect . “With social distancing measures in place, now people can enjoy theteadancesafely from their place of residence,he explained. “We hope theteadancehour will help reconnect some of the regularteadancersand allow people to share in some of the special memories from the event.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information.In particular they want to hear from anyone who was in the Church Avenue area during the early hours of Monday morning and witnessed any suspicious activity.Police also want to hear from anyone who knows the whereabouts of the missing Peugeot car.SEAFORDE ndash A Seaforde woman has been appointed to chair Northern Irelandrsquos conservation

that as chairwoman she wants to make the council more open and has invited the public to contact the council through its secretariat.ldquoIf people want to contact us with their ideas they can do so by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs Browne, who has an OBE for her work in the commercial environment sector, said: ldquoThe statutory duty of the council is to look after nature reserves, such as the Quoile Pondage and other areas of natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair,

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down. The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.ldquoWe will continue to review the appropriateness of this activity on a daily basis to ensure that it remains the best solution for the local area.Confirmation that Phoenix Gas is carrying out the work in the heart of the resort when it is anticipated that there will be less traffic, has been welcomed by two local politicians, South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said he appreciates that for many, the ongoing roadworks across East Down ldquohas been a complicated time, but is pleased that the company is now able to carry out additional works in the Newcastle area, much earlier than planned.Cllr Devlin said that while many aspects of le are currently dficult

in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help.

The two are irretrievably entwined.First, lost jobs and businesses do cost lives, not dramatically in a sudden endemic. It kills just as surely over a period of time and also eats up expensive health, social and welfare services that we may need to help fend off the next pandemic. Second, the economy is what pays for our health, social and welfare services. Poor economy means fewer resources both in terms of increased demand for those services whilst concurrently implying a lower tax yield and hence lower income stream for those services we are now so appreciative of. Of course it must be gratying for those concerned to see all the public appreciation, on a Thursday evening, for their services. However, I cannot help wondering just how long this will last after the emergency is over. How many will vote for higher taxes to pay for better services, especially social welfare which takes such a burden off the NHS  How many tax dodgers in off-shore funds will volunteer to repatriate their billions to pay tax on it to maintain the NHS  What effort by our politicians and civil servants to clean up their act and ensure no more RHI scandals so that the money saved can go into better care and health facilities. Fewer £,pa Spads and more nurses or bio-medical scientists might be a good start, then we would also need fewer multi-million pound inquiries. Quiz our politicians, now that they are back, on that one.Meanwhile, we still have to deal with the current pandemic, and here I wish to raise a, not unrelated, serious question: just how serious is the current pandemic  I am not trying to trivialise, but deaths happen all the time, it’s normal.Thus the question arises of: how big an increase in deaths over the normal rate is currently occurring  Here one has to turn to the statistics, which are always dficult to analyse adequately, hence imperfect, but all that the decision takers have to go on.Working from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales, week ending th March,  : .%deaths in the over  bracket involved Covid-: in - bracket it was .% : meanwhile no Covid- deaths were recorded in the under one and - age groups. Meanwhile, the total number of Covid- deaths was , out of a total of , deaths , thus  Covid- deathswere in the age group +. Meanwhile, .% of all deaths mentioned ‘influenza or pneumonia’ , Covid- or both. By comparison, the previous five year average for deaths involving influenza and pneumonia was .%.The foregoing is just an example of the kind of figures decision makers will have to grapple with. First this seems to be a virus that particularly affects the elderly and those with underlying respiratory conditions. When placing Covid- related deaths in perspective, the majority appear to affect those who have already reached, or nearly, the modern average le expectancy . More recent data since that cited above confirms that the median age of people who die is over .Is it just that a new disease is carrying us off rather than an old one If that is the case, then what is the justication for closing down an entire economy, which will also involve many premature deaths, perhaps of much younger and potentially more productive people.This is not an easy or comfortable question, and I am not proposing any answer, but it is one that needs asking and should be the basis for proper public debate, both in the media and politically.As the News Letter editorial ‘The world’s oldest daily newspaper is reporting this pandemic as it has reported other global health crises over the centuries,’ April  reminds us, in  , died from plague in Constantinople – that would cause panic, but we should not. Covid- is serious, but just how much in the great scheme of things has yet to be fully appraised and we need to keep calm and, especially, think rationally of how and where we limit the worst effects.• Dr James Dingley is chairman of Francis Hutcheson Institute"},{"url":null,"title":"how many people have tested positive covid  your local area today ","story":"Tragedy for PSNI widow Kate Carroll after son Shane found dead at same age stepfather Stephen was murderedBallycastle tragedy: Father who lost his we and three year-old daughter is at the bedside of surviving daughter wee HannahNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsPeopleThis is how many people have tested positive for COVID- in your local area - as of todayThe Department of Health has revealed the number of people infected with COVID- throughout NI.By Gemma MurrayWednesday, th May , : pm\"\"ALSO READ: Another two people die in NI after testing positive for coronavirus bringing death toll to  - find out how many people have died so far in your local areaIt is broken down into Local Government Area’s - Belfast - ,Coronavirus COVID- swabs : PA Wire PA Images \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

This scheme is a leline for them, but they need to get enrolled.Clearly in hastily setting up of the system, the necessary back office database was not built to process or accept these two forms of ID.”The Lagan Valley MP added: “We welcome the commitments from both the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and Mr Norman that the matter will be resolved. The computer may say ‘no’ but the Government certainty says ‘yes’.“The important issue is that no man or woman is excluded because of this administrative matter. If anyone has run into this problem and cannot get any other form of ID, they should contact their local DUP MP who can raise matter with Treasury and ensure it is resolved.”Responding to a News Letter enquiry on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for HMRC said: “We want to reassure those in Northern Ireland that they will not be excluded from the scheme. Anyone can check their eligibility for the scheme using our eligibility checker, andthey meet the criteria, can apply.“Anyone who has engaged with us online before, to file theirfor example, should be able to use their existing credentials to claim online.

We’ve seen some retailers doing delivery numbers they thought they’d be doing in eight years’ time.“But there’s a big, big thing here - there are people out there, disabled, elderly, and we’re asking the public to think before they click. Quite simply, delivery slots should be for the most vulnerable in society.”Instead the public should either get their own groceriesor get click-and-collects.The whole surge means that “here in Northern Ireland our retailers are hiring proportionately... some are permanent contracts, some are temporary”.He said they were “hiring for attitude, and training for skill” - meaning people with few qualications can still find roles in the supermarkets.He also said that “one of the laziest  narratives out there is that retailers are making a killing”. Rather, their margins have been squeezed by people buying cheaper ‘own brand’ goods instead of treating themselves.Lastly, he voiced “pride” in how day-to-day staff are handling themselves in the crisis, adding there is a “zero tolerance” approach to people shouting and becoming confrontationalasked to socially distance themselves.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
