If the sun sets in the evening with a rosy glow, then there is likely to be sunshine the following morning.The saying is most reliable when weather systems predominantly come from the West as they do in the UK.So, if it’s fine in the West, then beams from the sun — as it sets in that direction— can stream unhindered through the clear skies and light up any clouds drifting off to the East.Meanwhile, the saying, ‘red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’ is also usually right. A red sky appears early in the day as a result of the high-pressure weather system having already moved east. This means the good weather has passed, most likely making way for a windy low-pressure system and rain — falling on the shepherds’ flocks.PLANT PREDICTORSWhen the air gets humid in the hours before rain, many wild-flowers protectively close their petals.Typical are daisies. If the white petals are closed and you cannot see the yellow middle disc, it is not wise to hang out your washing.WHY STEMS SNAPMost plants are naturally stable enough to withstand heavy rainfall.However, so many varieties that we grow in modern gardens are unnaturally made to grow faster by being given artificial fertiliser. This leads to tall, fragile stems that are insufficiently woody. It is little wonder that they snap easily under stress.ALL HAIL A STORMYou can learn a lot about the life-story of a hailstone by slicing it in half.It has a layered structure similar to the rings in tree trunks — both showing their age. Hailstones are formed in storm clouds. As they are pulled up several miles into the sky by strong wind currents, more water accumulates on their outsides and they freeze, making them bigger.When the strength of the wind drops in the highest altitudes, the hailstones fall back down into the stormy zone, where the updraught again thrusts them upward.Each time they do this they get bigger until, finally, they become too heavy to be kept in the air by wind currents and they drop to the ground.Each layer of ice is created by a single ‘up and down’ journey through the storm cloud. For example, five rings correspond to five loops of this natural rollercoaster.THE BEAK-ING CLOCKEvolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned out.So, in order to warn off rivals, or to woo a mate, different species tend to start at different times in the morning.The skylark begins while it’s still dark — one and a half hours before sunrise. Next, redstarts begin their chorus.    Evolution has led birds to sing at different time of day so as to give themselves a better chance to be heard rather than being drowned outBlackbirds then perform exactly one hour before sunrise, with chiffchaffs following 30 minutes later.Then, as the sun appears on the horizon, all the birds join in the dawn chorus. From then on, if you want to determine the time without aid of a watch, you’ll need to turn your attention to flowers.ANT AND TREKHave you ever puzzled over why flowers that have grown for years in a certain area of your garden suddenly appear in another part the following spring? It may be because ants picked up the seeds to gorge on fleshy, oil-rich appendages (called elaiosomes) which are found on some seeds and then they drop them up to 90 feet away from the parent plant.Plants which make use of this free delivery service include wild strawberries, dog violets, wild garlic, dead-nettles and forget-me-nots.WATERING TIPSBritain averages 133 days of rain or snow a year, totalling 885 millimetres.Plants adapt to deal with these downpours in different ways. Watch, for example, how, when it rains, rhubarb uses its large, funnel-shaped leaves to catch the water and guide it down its stems to the roots. The same technique is used by dandelions.Water management in your gardens depends on the soil type. Sandy soils allow a lot of water to trickle into the deeper layers, meaning that the groundwater is well replenished, but plants can dry out quickly. On the other hand, loamy soils — a mixture of sand, silt and clay — retain moisture from which plants benefit even over long periods with low levels of rainfall.There is a simple trick for checking whether your soil is sufficiently moist: push aside the humus (the brownish black matter on top, usually just one to two centimetres deep) until you see the pure soil.Press a clump of this between your index finger and thumb. If it sticks together, it is moist enough. But if it crumbles as soon as you release your fingers, it is too dry.Of course, you can provide remedial action by watering — but don’t mollycoddle your plants by watering your garden every day. By over-watering, they get used to having moisture around their roots and spread them out close to the surface.The fact is that plants thrive when they have to make an effort to find water and therefore grow much deeper roots. By doing so, they can always meet at least part of their fluid requirements even when the topsoil has dried out. The best solution during dry periods is to drench plants thoroughly. This simulates natural precipitation and ensures the water reaches the plants’ lower roots.Since the plant then has no incentive to direct its roots upwards, this encourages resilience and allows you to go away for a fortnight without your entire garden drying out.CLUES IN THE CLOUDSThe presence of condensation trails of aeroplanes (called ‘contrails’) are an early sign of bad weather.If these don’t dissolve, it means humidity is on its way and the sky will soon cloud over. The movement of real clouds also gives clues.As a rule of thumb, the weather will always change when clouds are moving in a different direction to the direction of the wind at ground level.Tall, towering clouds on the horizon herald rain. And clouds puffed out at the top, or forming an anvil shape, mean a thunderstorm is on the way.INSECT INDICATORSThe behaviour of creatures in your garden will give you a good idea of the temperature. At 0c many cold-blooded insects have a form of anti-freeze in their circulation systems to stop them being affected by the cold. This means they are happy to fly around at temperatures just over zero degrees.For example, ladybirds and winter crane flies (also known as winter midges) produce the chemical compound glycerol, a substance once used in car anti-freeze, to stop themselves getting too cold.          When spring temperatures reach 5c, it is the trigger for toads and frogs to start spawning.Bees only leave the hive at temperatures above 12c. Also, you’ll never hear the chirping (technically called stridulating) of grasshoppers and crickets below 12c.Honey bees cluster together in hives in the winter, maintaining a core temperature of 25c.They manage to maintain this level with the energy provided from their stores of honey.TELL THE TIME, PETALDifferent plants open their flowers at different points in the day.Pumpkins and courgettes (both from the cucurbits family of plants) kick things off by opening their flowers at 5am. From 8am, marigolds spread out their golden petals and daisies follow at 9am.When the sun’s at its peak at noon, the bedding plant Mesembryanthemum opens its blossoms.Between 2pm and 3pm, after a morning’s work, dandelions start to close their heads, and by 3pm, gourd flowers have finished for the day.After doing the longest shift, poppies shut up shop at around 6pm.But it’s after sunset that certain flowers open, attracting flying pollinators — such as moths — which are on the wing for a sip of nectar at this late hour.Many plant species have adopted this late-opening strategy, including evening primrose.Others remain open all day but only start to emit their seductive aromas after dusk — common soapwort and the perennial phlox among them.If you like to sit outside on a warm summer evening, plant a few specimens of these night bloomers in your favourite spot.You’ll be well rewarded by the opportunity to observe some shy visitors, including many you may have never seen before.FEATHER FORECASTERSThe ancient saying, ‘when swallows fly high, the weather will be dry’ is not accurate. In fact, swallows fly higher than normal when the wind picks up before a storm.A much better guide to weather changes is the chaffinch (Britain’s seventh most common species of bird). It has an idiosyncratic way of warning us. In fine weather, males usually trill a melody that goes ‘chi-chip-chirichirichiri-chip-cheweeoo’.However, if rain is imminent, it sounds a monosyllabic ‘raaatch’.FLIGHT RISKSMoths orientate themselves by flying at a constant angle to the Moon.Unfortunately, they often confuse artificial street lights and domestic light-bulbs for the lunar glow.Sadly, they often crash into these man-made lights and are killed.Inevitably, predators have taken advantage. On warm summer nights, bats cleverly patrol street-lamps in the hope of easy pickings.If you want to help save insects from such a fate, close your blinds and curtains as soon as you switch on your lights after dark so as to reduce the artificial glare through your windows.The same applies to lights in your garden, which attract spiders and woodlice.SMELLING DANGERResearchers have recently discovered that plants talk to one another via ‘scent messages’.Trees, for example, warn each other about insect attacks by giving off a chemical distress signal. This is the cue for others of the same species to produce defensive chemicals that are then stored in their bark ready to give off themselves if necessary.Similarly, plants emit warning signals when under stress — for example when they are lacking food or water. Conversely, when happy with their location and have enough food, pine trees give off a sweet, aromatic fragrance.

Pictured: Michael Crawford at 11Actor Michael Crawford was an 11-year-old schoolboy when he watched the occasion with his family in The Mall. He tells the programme: ‘This brought our country together – it’s very stirring, moving and brings out great pride.’Looking at his scrapbook from the time about the Coronation he admits: ‘It was a passion. Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round. I remember how glamorous the Queen looked, this radiant figure.\u0027In one sequence, a line of carriages in the Palace courtyard prepare to transport members of the Royal Family and VIPs including Winston Churchill to the Abbey.The Prince recalls the journey in a carriage with his mother, Princess Marina, his sister, Princess Alexandra, and brother, the Duke of Kent. \u0027There was an enormous crowd and they had periscopes, a lot of them, which were strange-looking devices where you looked through a viewer, and it then went up and you could look over the heads of the people in front of you… \u0027So you had a forest of these strange-looking things which were sticking out from the crowd.\u0027The sight of the Queen\u0027s four-ton Gold State Coach with eight grey horses also transfixed him.\u0027I don\u0027t think there are very often occasions where eight greys pull a coach. You have to have as many as that because the Coronation coach weighs so much.\u0027The Prince, 75, adds: \u0027It was a wonderful occasion and it\u0027s amazing to think we are here all these years later.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Coronation In Colour is on ITV tomorrow at 9pm.

By Damian Green Amid the cacophony of claims and rival claims over our departure from the EU, there\u0027s one fact we can all agree on. Brexit Day itself is now just nine months away and time is not on the UK\u0027s side.This period will shape the future of Britain\u0027s relationship with Europe for decades to come.As we approach the second anniversary in a few weeks\u0027 time of the fateful referendum, the negotiations with Brussels – already difficult – are about to become even tougher. So last week I went to No10 with colleagues Amber Rudd and Justine Greening to assure the Prime Minister that, far from being isolated in her search for a pragmatic, workable solution, she does in fact have widespread support from her party.That may surprise readers used to the clamour from arch-Brexiteers and die-hard Remainers alike on the Tory benches. But it is time for those two camps to face reality.          Damian Green: Amid the cacophony of claims and rival claims over our departure from the EU, there\u0027s one fact we can all agree on. Brexit Day itself is now just nine months away and time is not on the UK\u0027s sideAt this crucial juncture, any politician who wants a successful outcome for Britain needs to choose their words carefully.Every Minister who goes to Brussels is struck by how closely domestic British arguments are followed there – and how they can be used against our vital national interests.Many of us have had the experience of warning European leaders that just because an anonymous \u0027senior figure\u0027 is quoted in the press predicting doom and failure, or citing hopeless isions within Government, this should not be taken as gospel truth.This is a danger at the moment because the British negotiating team, from the Prime Minister down, has to be able to reach agreement on two separate fronts.They have to come up with proposals which they can agree with the EU leaders. Then these proposals need to gain the approval of Parliament.Of course, the EU side knows this only too well.So the more the British side is restricted by domestic noises off, the tougher the stance the EU side will feel confident in taking. This cannot help Britain\u0027s case. One very damaging and misguided line of argument is that Britain is all-powerful in these negotiations, so the mere threat of our walking away will bring the Europeans promptly to heel. This is not just a misnomer: the fact that it is so clearly unrealistic has the effect of making Britain look even weaker.          I am afraid that even my friend, the intelligent and energetic Jacob Rees-Mogg, who runs the European Research Group inside the Conservative Party, occasionally lapses in this wayI am afraid that even my friend, the intelligent and energetic Jacob Rees-Mogg, who runs the European Research Group inside the Conservative Party, occasionally lapses in this way.Last week he overstated our negotiating strength in an obviously misleading way by claiming that the EU was under pressure to strike a deal \u0027because we buy more from them than they do from us by £100billion a year\u0027.All that tells us is that there are 450 million Europeans wanting to sell to us and only 65 million Brits selling to them.We all buy and sell to each other. While, indeed, 18 per cent of their exports come to us, a whopping 44 per cent of ours head across the Channel to other EU countries. No wonder British manufacturers are nervous. However, it is still clearly in the interests of both sides to strike a deal.The steel tariff war with America highlights the need to retain strong pan-European ties – the better to flex our combined trading muscles. However, a deal is essential not just to keep trade flowing but to ensure our mutual security. Without the UK contribution to policing and anti-terrorism, the whole of Europe would be less safe.If, for example, the European Commission continues to insist on removing the UK from the satellite communication system Galileo, then Europe as a whole will have a less effective and more expensive GPS tracking system. How exactly does that serve the people of the EU? So we do have some cards to play.The Europeans should not be over-influenced by those who make the most noise at the two extremes of the argument in the UK, from some of Jacob\u0027s followers – who would be happiest if we made no deal at all – to those who want to rerun the referendum.From the amount of heat generated by these two viewpoints, you would be excused for assuming that everyone in Britain either wants nothing to do with the EU ever again, or wants to carry on as though the vote never happened.I believe this is a misreading of the public mood, and I know that this is not an accurate picture of the majority view inside the Conservative Party.          Certainly, if you are working in a car plant that depends on daily deliveries of parts from around Europe, or in an insurance company that wants to sell policies to other EU citizens, you mainly want to know that your job is not at riskThe centre of gravity on the issue is that we took a decision in 2016 and the Government\u0027s job is to make a deal that returns the powers people wanted exercised at home while minimising any damage to our economy that would come through barriers to trade.If that means deciding to keep some of our rules the same as the EU rules for pragmatic reasons, then as long as we are taking that decision ourselves, it\u0027s fine.As to what this means in detail, I am afraid that at this point we are in danger of moving on to arguments about different customs arrangements – and for most people this is understandably the moment to tune out.Certainly, if you are working in a car plant that depends on daily deliveries of parts from around Europe, or in an insurance company that wants to sell policies to other EU citizens, you mainly want to know that your job is not at risk.Politicians making grand warnings in Churchillian-sounding phrases about becoming a \u0027vassal state\u0027 don\u0027t help pay the bills.The British people have always been a practical breed.This will be a source of strength for a supremely pragmatic Prime Minister who can face the European negotiators across the table safe in the knowledge that her instincts are in tune with the people.A country that voted 5248 per cent to leave clearly wants Brexit but a Brexit that leaves us in a close and friendly relationship. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/18/4CD7C23100000578-5798719-image-a-21_1527962184297.jpg","title":"Confessions deliciously indiscreet QC","story":"    The press raved over Amal Clooney’s outfit at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

The High Court judge who first heard her claim asked me to represent Bryce Taylor, which would mean cross-examining the ‘People’s Princess’.I would need to explore under cross-examination Diana’s two-faced attitude to privacy – she had told the tawdry secrets of her marriage to journalist Andrew Morton for a book which blackened Charles’s name.However, on the evening before ‘the trial of the century’, there was a deal, and Diana’s lawyers withdrew her claim, reportedly after depositing $1 million in Bryce’s Swiss bank account.This was all swathed in secrecy, of course, so the Princess could claim to have ‘won’.I was somewhat deflated, as always when a big case settles at the door of the court.It’s a condition my witty wife Kathy Lette called ‘courtus interruptus’.  ... and the time I hid James Hewitt in my London atticI also once advised Diana’s lover, James Hewitt.The press was in full pursuit after the story broke of his royal romance with the Princess, so he hid in a converted pigsty in the South of France and then prevailed on an Army helicopter pilot to fly him to North London, where he hid in our attic for a few days while I mulled over the 1351 Treason Act, which still punished with death any party to adultery with the wife of the monarch’s eldest son and heir.If James was bang to rights, Diana would have been guilty as an accomplice, although I had to doubt whether she would suffer the same fate as Anne Boleyn.

So last week I went to No10 with colleagues Amber Rudd and Justine Greening to assure the Prime Minister that, far from being isolated in her search for a pragmatic, workable solution, she does in fact have widespread support from her party.That may surprise readers used to the clamour from arch-Brexiteers and die-hard Remainers alike on the Tory benches. But it is time for those two camps to face reality.          Damian Green: Amid the cacophony of claims and rival claims over our departure from the EU, there\u0027s one fact we can all agree on. Brexit Day itself is now just nine months away and time is not on the UK\u0027s sideAt this crucial juncture, any politician who wants a successful outcome for Britain needs to choose their words carefully.Every Minister who goes to Brussels is struck by how closely domestic British arguments are followed there – and how they can be used against our vital national interests.Many of us have had the experience of warning European leaders that just because an anonymous \u0027senior figure\u0027 is quoted in the press predicting doom and failure, or citing hopeless isions within Government, this should not be taken as gospel truth.This is a danger at the moment because the British negotiating team, from the Prime Minister down, has to be able to reach agreement on two separate fronts.They have to come up with proposals which they can agree with the EU leaders. Then these proposals need to gain the approval of Parliament.Of course, the EU side knows this only too well.So the more the British side is restricted by domestic noises off, the tougher the stance the EU side will feel confident in taking. This cannot help Britain\u0027s case. One very damaging and misguided line of argument is that Britain is all-powerful in these negotiations, so the mere threat of our walking away will bring the Europeans promptly to heel. This is not just a misnomer: the fact that it is so clearly unrealistic has the effect of making Britain look even weaker.          I am afraid that even my friend, the intelligent and energetic Jacob Rees-Mogg, who runs the European Research Group inside the Conservative Party, occasionally lapses in this wayI am afraid that even my friend, the intelligent and energetic Jacob Rees-Mogg, who runs the European Research Group inside the Conservative Party, occasionally lapses in this way.Last week he overstated our negotiating strength in an obviously misleading way by claiming that the EU was under pressure to strike a deal \u0027because we buy more from them than they do from us by £100billion a year\u0027.All that tells us is that there are 450 million Europeans wanting to sell to us and only 65 million Brits selling to them.We all buy and sell to each other. While, indeed, 18 per cent of their exports come to us, a whopping 44 per cent of ours head across the Channel to other EU countries. No wonder British manufacturers are nervous. However, it is still clearly in the interests of both sides to strike a deal.The steel tariff war with America highlights the need to retain strong pan-European ties – the better to flex our combined trading muscles. However, a deal is essential not just to keep trade flowing but to ensure our mutual security. Without the UK contribution to policing and anti-terrorism, the whole of Europe would be less safe.If, for example, the European Commission continues to insist on removing the UK from the satellite communication system Galileo, then Europe as a whole will have a less effective and more expensive GPS tracking system. How exactly does that serve the people of the EU? So we do have some cards to play.The Europeans should not be over-influenced by those who make the most noise at the two extremes of the argument in the UK, from some of Jacob\u0027s followers – who would be happiest if we made no deal at all – to those who want to rerun the referendum.From the amount of heat generated by these two viewpoints, you would be excused for assuming that everyone in Britain either wants nothing to do with the EU ever again, or wants to carry on as though the vote never happened.I believe this is a misreading of the public mood, and I know that this is not an accurate picture of the majority view inside the Conservative Party.          Certainly, if you are working in a car plant that depends on daily deliveries of parts from around Europe, or in an insurance company that wants to sell policies to other EU citizens, you mainly want to know that your job is not at riskThe centre of gravity on the issue is that we took a decision in 2016 and the Government\u0027s job is to make a deal that returns the powers people wanted exercised at home while minimising any damage to our economy that would come through barriers to trade.If that means deciding to keep some of our rules the same as the EU rules for pragmatic reasons, then as long as we are taking that decision ourselves, it\u0027s fine.As to what this means in detail, I am afraid that at this point we are in danger of moving on to arguments about different customs arrangements – and for most people this is understandably the moment to tune out.Certainly, if you are working in a car plant that depends on daily deliveries of parts from around Europe, or in an insurance company that wants to sell policies to other EU citizens, you mainly want to know that your job is not at risk.Politicians making grand warnings in Churchillian-sounding phrases about becoming a \u0027vassal state\u0027 don\u0027t help pay the bills.The British people have always been a practical breed.This will be a source of strength for a supremely pragmatic Prime Minister who can face the European negotiators across the table safe in the knowledge that her instincts are in tune with the people.A country that voted 5248 per cent to leave clearly wants Brexit but a Brexit that leaves us in a close and friendly relationship. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c86c959dc1a445321ce116745743da9e5b6f67/0_1059_6200_3719/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60c96a8eab4fb6095d9333896caf1a20","title":"original observer photography","story":"Laura Linney, Lily Allen and Karen Gibson – the woman who rocked the Royal Wedding.

She, like everyone else, called it “the secret bookstore”. Except it wasn’t a bookshop so much as a small apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, deliriously overstuffed with paperbacks and presided over by a bearded guy named Michael Seidenberg. On certain nights Seidenberg, who exudes a maverick ingenuousness, might open up his treasure cave for late-night salons where a bottle of whiskey is generally understood to be the entrance fee. Perhaps a couple of books will be exchanged for a few dollars (I once bought a bright green, 1969 first edition of Renata Adler’s Toward a Radical Middle from him for about five bucks) but sales aren’t really the point. In a city like New York, a place increasingly beholden to money, it’s good to be reminded that there are other forms of currency. Not just the civility of a bottle of bourbon, but those other, priceless currencies, too, the ones that New Yorkers don’t like to invoke because they all sound embarrassingly earnest: community, human connection and the preservation of knowledge and ideas.Seidenberg, pictured kingly in his throne of a wicker chair, feet spread, pipe in mouth, is one of around 50 New York indie booksellers featured in a series of portraits by Philippe Ungar and Franck Bohbot, a pair of bibliophilic Frenchmen who met and befriended each other in Brooklyn. The two, writer and photographer respectively, have taken great pleasure in travelling across the city, to neighbourhoods in every borough, to meet and photograph booksellers in their habitats. Despite their ersity, the way their distinct personalities and passions are reflected and amplified in their shops, they are all, says Ungar, “looking for the same thing – a generous vision of sharing culture”. Ungar mentions Corey Farach, owner of the scruffy, adored and longstanding feminist bookshop Bluestockings. Farach, as Ungar recounts with admiration, encourages those people who can’t afford to buy a $40 book to take a seat, make themselves comfortable, and just read it in the shop. “That is to me,” says Ungar, “the spirit of the indie booksellers.” Because, as he sees it, “a bookstore is much more than a bookstore, it’s much more than selling books. It’s a public shelter. Whoever you are, you don’t have to buy anything, they won’t ask you for your ID. You’re free – you can stay for hours and browse. There’s a generosity, an optimism. And that’s what we wanted to enhance.”In this way, indie bookshops are outposts of idealism. And if they seem like the most romantic places in the city, it might be down to this – to the way their owners and customers (although “guests”, frankly, seems a more appropriate term) might all be engaged in the same project, a kind of sanctuary building in the unsheltered world. No one is getting rich from indie bookselling, yet everyone Ungar and Bohbot spoke to professed contentment. “Everyone,” Ungar stresses. “Every bookseller says: ‘I’m happy.’” He mentions Bonnie Slotnick, who runs Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks in the East Village, a small space crammed with vintage titles. Slotnick acknowledged to Ungar that she was not doing something vital, at least not in the way most people understand it. She was not a soldier or a doctor or a scientist curing disease. And yet she thought there was a place in the world for people who are just making other people happy.“They are heroes of their neighbourhood, monuments of their neighbourhood,” declares Bohbot, who sought to shoot them accordingly, with dramatic, dimmed lighting and cinematic composition in which the subject is alone, surrounded by their books. Often, there’s a poignancy to this heroism the photos are haunted with a question: how much longer can they last? New York, a city unsentimental about its past, endlessly, relentlessly revises itself. That extends to its bookshops, many of which have fallen to astronomically rising rents. St Mark’s Bookshop, for example, which opened in 1977 and became a sort of literary HQ for punks, was the oldest independent bookshop in Manhattan until it closed in 2016, despite celebrity support from Patti Smith and Salman Rushdie.Three Lives \u0026amp Company, an extremely charming West Village shop run by Toby Cox, a gentle, stooped guy in a knit hat, looked to go the same way as St Mark’s but narrowly escaped closure in 2016 after an upswell of neighbourhood support. Oliver’s Realty Group, which owns the building, provided a statement in a letter Cox sent out to his customers: “We know how beloved Three Lives is in the West Village and we’re thrilled to provide it with stability.”Like actual endangered species, independent bookshops induce a fiercely protective kind of love paradoxically, it’s often their precarity that saves them. Bohbot says he wants people to view his images and feel “we don’t know which year we are – we don’t know if it’s the future or the past”. He adds: “I want to stop time - I’m trying to keep them for ever, in this photo.”Like a bookshop, then, it’s an act of preservation.Hermione Hoby’s debut novel, Neon in Daylight, will be published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson on 26 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caab2748b3b41807aaab36ee5980dd88c86eed3c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1820b5396a25e2bfafb7f4ab566f058","title":"observer view islamophobia conservative party","story":"The Tories must launch an independent inquiry into anti-Muslim prejudice in the partyIn 2011, Sayeeda Warsi, then co-chair of the Conservative party, argued that Islamophobia had passed the “dinner-table” test that bigotry against British Muslims was becoming increasingly acceptable in polite company. It has become increasingly clear since then that that polite company extends to the Conservative party itself.The Observer is the world\u0027s oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by  News \u0026amp Media and is editorially independent.The most high-profile case raised by the MCB is that of Bob Blackman MP. In recent months, he has retweeted a message from Tommy Robinson, founder of the English Defence League, which cited an attack on a Hindu temple as “the reality of being surrounded by Islam”, which he later said was an error. He has shared a Facebook post from an Islamophobic website and has hosted Tapan Ghosh, a hardline Islamophobic Hindu nationalist, at an event in parliament. Not only has Blackman faced no disciplinary action, Theresa May chose to campaign with him in his constituency in March.There are several other incidents raised by the MCB, including that of a Conservative councillor who shared an article on social media that claimed that French Muslims were “content to live off the state and breed like rabbits”, a council candidate who said Britain should “revoke Muslim immigration” and another candidate who posted a photograph of a rasher of bacon hanging on a door handle, saying: “Protect your house from terrorism.” The MCB says it believes these cases could be the “tip of the iceberg”.Senior Muslim Conservatives, including Warsi and Lord Sheikh, have backed the call for an independent inquiry. Warsi says she has tried and failed to get these issues addressed by the party leadership and that she believes there is a “simmering underbelly” of Islamophobia in the Conservative party.If Theresa May continues to ignore these serious accusations, she cannot avoid the charge that Tories are unwilling to meaningfully confront racism in their ranks. Together with Labour’s deplorable failure to tackle its own problems with antisemitism, it creates the unedifying impression that Britain’s two main political parties are more comfortable making political capital out of calling each other out for bigotry than resolving the problems within their own houses.The Conservative party leadership must also acknowledge its role in encouraging Islamophobia. In 2016, Zac Goldsmith’s campaign for London mayor deployed a series of nasty dogwhistles implying that his Muslim opponent, Sadiq Khan, had links to Islamic extremists. Goldsmith faced no censure and his approach was effectively endorsed by the leadership. David Cameron claimed an imam whom Khan had shared a platform with was “a supporter of IS” in order to discredit Khan, for which he later had to apologise. Theresa May argued Khan was unfit to be mayor “at a time when we face a significant threat from terrorism”.This is not the only instance where the Tory party has shown its willingness to engage in racialised nods and winks to win votes. The government’s hostile-environment policy, in which private citizens such as landlords are obliged to check people’s papers, increases discrimination against people with foreign names and is ineffective at reducing illegal immigration. Yet it has pursued this policy to win support from voters it fears might otherwise back the far right.At a time when we have seen rising levels of Islamophobic hate crime in Britain, the Conservatives’ lackadaisical approach to tackling Islamophobia within their own ranks is utterly unacceptable. The party should urgently launch an independent investigation. But the prime minister should also question whether stoking prejudice and discrimination is a price the modern Tory party is willing to pay for attracting votes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fd18b92bcb072ec77cb7a7d148b03ee4559edc9/0_139_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cbb552b50e6fbcf1ae2e63e1c0275ad","title":"theresa may zombie prime minister difficult to finish off","story":"In the event of nuclear armageddon, it is said that the cockroach would rule the Earth. I have a growing suspicion that the hardy insects would find that they shared the post-apocalypse wasteland with Theresa May. She has demonstrated an ability to survive existential threats that has astonished scientific opinion.This week, she will have endured a year in Number 10 since the general election that was conceived in hubris and ended in disaster. This is not an anniversary the prime minister will want to linger upon. She went into that campaign with a double-digit lead in the polls and Tory dreams of a landslide and came out of it without a parliamentary majority. The consensus was that her credibility had suffered a fatal dose of political irradiation. Conservative MPs counted her longevity as prime minister in days, maybe weeks, months if they were generous. The spectacle of a premiership going to pieces before the nation’s eyes was magnified by a maladroit and frightened response to the terrible Grenfell Tower inferno. In the wake of that, one senior Tory, usually an astute reader of his party’s moods, offered me the prediction: “She is one more disaster away from being ejected.”He was right to suggest that there would be further calamities, but wrong to conclude that these would be terminal for Mrs May. She had a farcical party conference, followed by a flailing reshuffle that underscored the feebleness of her position. Four of her cabinet have been forced to quit, one of them the effective deputy prime minister. The entire 12 months have been dominated by the joyless grind of managing Tory isions over Brexit, while her earlier hardline rhetoric has melted on contact with the realities of trying to navigate an orderly withdrawal from the EU.Yet there she is, despite it all, still in Number 10. In the immediate aftermath of the election, I dubbed her “the zombie prime minister”. Do I now regret that phrase? No. I still think it an apposite description of a premiership that has never recovered its authority. But perhaps I should have added the caveat that zombies can be very resilient. That which is already dead is hard to kill.From disaster, Mrs May has derived a form of durability. Allies say that nothing else in her political career will match the feeling of abject failure that engulfed her at 10pm on 8 June last year when the exit poll was broadcast. She cried and came close to quitting as prime minister in the subsequent hours. However awful the humiliations that have followed, and whatever further ignominy destiny has in store, nothing will ever be as bad for her as that night.This is her inner personal fortification. Her outer shield has been the numeracy and the inadequacies of the candidates to replace her. During the year since the election, Tories have found it easier to find ways to describe Mrs May as useless than they have to agree which of them would make things better. One of her more successful calculations was giving a big job to Boris Johnson in the belief that this would expose him as fundamentally unfit for large responsibilities. Amber Rudd was sunk by the Windrush scandal. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid fancy their chances. In common with other potential contenders, they want someone else to arrange the disposal of Mrs May rather than get blood spilt on their own hands. Gavin Williamson’s spider has had better reviews from Tory MPs than its owner. Philip Hammond is said to be planning a speech on capitalism. Philip who? The chancellor has been the invisible man. He has adopted such a low profile that it is not so much a submarine strategy as a deep sea ing bell strategy.Not so Michael Gove, who is lurking in a rather obvious way and touting himself as half of a complicated double-headed leadership deal with Ruth Davidson. Before she succumbs to that offer, Ms Davidson would be wise to consult Mr Johnson about the perils of coupling her fortunes to the machinations of Mr Gove. Liberal Tories pant for the leader of the Scottish Conservatives to come south to be their standard bearer, but before anything can come of that she first has to acquire a seat in the right parliament. Then a self-described “pregnant lesbian” would have to take her leadership chances with a shrunken and mainly aged Tory membership whose social attitudes lag behind the country as a whole.These many contenders have something in common: the hunger of their ambition is tempered by caution about timing. There have been 12 months of conversations about replacing Mrs May, but they have all run up against the fear of unleashing a chaotic and vicious struggle for the party that could blow it up. Rivals for the premiership have flinched from that, as they have also shied from taking up the burden of delivering Brexit, an unwillingness to take responsibility for what they willed that is particularly pronounced among the Brexiters. Brexit is the water torture of the May premiership and also its life-preserver. Every Tory who craves the crown has concluded that it would best to let Mrs May perform the contortions necessary to try to hold the party together until it is done.The hard Brexiters have been exposed as bluffers. Jacob Rees-Mogg is all mouth and trousers, as we say in Yorkshire. If his cabal had the will to do so, they could easily assemble the 48 signatures required to trigger a no-confidence vote in Mrs May’s leadership. The regularity with which the Brextremists have threatened to collapse her premiership and then retreated from the deed has revealed the weakness of their own position.Labour has played a significant role in the preservation of Mrs May. She has had no better friend than Jeremy Corbyn, an unwitting and unintended saviour of her premiership. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Labour thought she was there for the taking. His admirers indulged themselves with talk of Mr Corbyn being in Downing Street by Christmas. Tories could also visualise a Corbyn premiership – and decided that this was an outcome more to be loathed than soldiering on with a zombified prime minister. Scared that a leadership battle would precipitate another election that would see Labour roll into power, the Tories clung on to Mrs May for fear of something worse.The Corbyn Terror among Tory MPs has receded since the turn of the year. Labour has become preoccupied with its self-inflicted troubles. The local elections last month did not result in the feared Tory meltdown. Despite everything, the Conservatives have edged into a modest advantage in opinion polls. Mrs May’s personal approval scores have recovered. Her ratings are still deeply negative, but all politics is relative and she bests a Labour leader whose grip on the loyalty of his party’s members makes him irremovable.None of this means that the Conservatives are going to permit Mrs May to lead them for as long as she likes. Some grudging respect for her dogged capacity to soak up punishment doesn’t translate into a willingness to let her front the next general election. The flaws that were pitilessly exposed by the 2017 campaign haven’t been forgotten. The Tory party has not revised its bedrock view that Mrs May cannot be trusted with another election.What it does mean is that the Tories are not panicking as much as they were six months ago. They are not sweating as feverishly as they would be were Labour sitting on a substantial poll lead. Tories have decided they can tolerate leaving Mrs May at Number 10 a while longer.By writing about her survival, I am aware that I tempt fate. Perhaps she will be gone this week. The fundamentals of her position have not changed in the year since she shredded her authority by throwing away her parliamentary majority. She is an enfeebled prime minister in a confined and brittle position. She lives hand to mouth, crisis by crisis. Looming parliamentary votes on Brexit could detonate the Tory party and put her premiership in jeopardy.She would struggle to survive a rejection by the House of Commons of whatever deal with the EU she eventually manages to come back with. Her premiership will never be better than a contingent one. There is nothing noble or inspiring about this status, but a contingent premiership is still better than the alternative, which is an ex-premiership. Each additional day that she endures in Number 10 is, for Mrs May, a victory of sorts. And an example that it is not only the cockroach that can survive apocalypse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ed743457062d6f707123fbf1aa1b700690b20/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcf81e447b84c22ef2fc2ccb109776e","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8781866df9fab27fa46c2eea36d77dc5d54a7efc/0_76_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25cabc602a8fcd16eae3ac88fc9ba23e","title":"benedict cumberbatch saves deliveroo cyclist london","story":"Sherlock actor said to have jumped out of cab after seeing Deliveroo rider being attackedBenedict Cumberbatch is reported to have saved a cyclist who was being attacked.

As a one-man cultural revolution, Burgess was as refreshing and down-to-earth as a pint of Pennine bitter. He raised common sense to heights of genius and curiosity to a fever pitch. Below, we republish one of his most typical and entertaining pieces, on “A movie that changed my life”, Fritz Lang’s polis.We do this to launch the 2018 ObserverAnthony Burgess prize for arts journalism. This unique award, now in its seventh year, has become a landmark in contemporary British cultural commentary. Once again, the Observer and our co-sponsor, the International Anthony Burgess Foundation, are on the lookout for a young writer who can follow Burgess’s inspiration, filing newspaper copy that’s never less than generous, entertaining, well informed, witty and wise. The competition starts here. Robert McCrumHas any movie ever changed anybody’s life? The art or craft of the cinema has had, like any other mode of expression, the chance to modify the ways we think, feel, see, hear, even believe, but it has missed it, muffed it, failed. Books are different so is music. Spend an evening reading the sixth book of Milton’s Paradise Lost, or listening to Mahler’s Resurrection Symphony, and you can feel your attitude to life being changed. This is probably because you are placed in contact with a powerful sensibility, allied to a towering intellect, that is unified and knows what it believes. But movies are not inidual works they are the products of a collective, and, as such, they bristle with compromise. Reputable scriptwriters weep to find their best scenes discarded. Great directors howl with rage at brutal cuts. The film is a commercial form, and it cannot permit genius to rage untrammelled, for the general public does not care much for genius. Originality is dangerous, so is the naked truth. We have had movies that approached greatness – like Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane – but always had to yield to what the box office would permit.I speak, of course, of Hollywood, the world centre, as it once was, of commercial cinema. Hollywood produced very efficient artefacts, but it was short on courage – which, anyway, would always be damped by the censors. The situation in Europe has been different, though the American philosophy of film, along with American finance, has finally prevailed. Things were different when Buñuel and Dalí concocted Un Chien Andalou and Jean Cocteau produced Le Sang d’un Poète on a shoestring. And, as long ago as 1927, before Fritz Lang emigrated to the United States, it was possible to approach greatness with the film polis.If any movie got near to changing my life, it was this. It cost a lot of money to make and nearly ruined the German organisation, Ufa, that financed it. But the expense was justified. I still look at it on videocassette and, in 1975, I had the chance to improvise music for it on the piano at a cinema club showing in Iowa City. My father had done the same thing professionally (that is, for enough money to buy a couple of beers) at the film’s first showing in Manchester, England. I remember that occasion. It is, as they say, etched on my brain. I was nine years old, and the publicity of stills and handouts affected me powerfully before viewing it in the sixpenny stalls. The movie itself was a revelation.In 1927, my generation drew its childish myths from two sources – the far past and the far future. The far past was really for the palaeontologists – the lost world of the brontosaurus, the tyrannosaurus, and the pterodactyl. This was explored in boy’s magazines, in a novel by A Conan Doyle, even in a crude film based on the latter’s The Lost World.The imaginary future was the other side of our mythical coin. We had been given the future long before, in HG Wells’s The Time Machine and When the Sleeper Wakes, and our boy’s magazines presented a cruder version of it, with spaceships, robots, skyscrapers and even the End of the World. If we British kids had been given the money for a trip to New York, we would have seen the skyline of the future, but we were stuck in dull suburbia, feeding on sub-literary trash and the trash of the cinema. But polis was not trash.The novel on which the movie was based was written by Fritz Lang’s wife, Thea von Harbou. One could buy it in Woolworths for five cents. It’s a pretty melodramatic story. Sometime in the future there is a great city, ruled by one man, a kind of super-capitalist named Joh Fredersen. The community is ided into the workers and the consumers. The consumers live in great luxury, while the workers dwell underground and shuffle to work at the blast of the whistle.A girl named Maria (played by Brigitte Helm) appears one day in the gorgeous gardens of the Club of the Sons – the sons, that is, of the ruling leisured class. She brings a group of miserable-looking children who gape in wonder at the peacocks and the flowers, and she looks Freder, the son of Fredersen, in the eye, saying, “These are your brothers and sisters”. She and her charges are bundled off, but young Fredersen has a moment of intense revelation. polis is founded on injustice, he realises, and he rushes to his father’s office to tell him this. His father is not pleased, and he sets a spy to follow him around to see that he does not get into socialist mischief.But the young man descends to the grim world of the workers, where he sees vast machines that appear to him to be incarnations of the god Moloch, swallowing human fodder alive. The technology is, by our standards, pretty primitive. It unloads a lot of steam, but the steam is appropriate to this vision of hell.In the medieval quarter of polis lives an inventor named Rotwang. He was once a contestant of Fredersen’s for the hand of Hel, a beautiful young woman who died giving birth to Freder. He has created a robot, all metal body and metallic brain, and this he proudly shows to Fredersen. The two men hate each other but are bound together in a kind of hostile symbiosis: inventive brain and autocratic power are joined in mutual need. But Fredersen’s visit to Rotwang concerns a matter of pure politics. Rotwang’s cellar leads to the old catacombs, where Fredersen suspects subversive meetings are taking place. The two men descend into a region of old bones and, hidden in the shadows, they observe such a meeting.Joh Fredersen tells Rotwang that the workers must by confirmed in their servitude, with no nonsense about human feeling (which might mean strikes and machine-smashing) and that the robot must be given Maria’s face and form and programmed to preach obedience to the Master of polis. So Maria is captured and, in an impressive but implausible Frankenstein sequence, we see the metal robot take on the appearance of flesh and the face of Maria. Then she tells the workers to smash the machines. This was never in the program. A robot can, apparently, go mad.It is a melodramatic plot, and the implausibilities stick out like sore thumbs. Some of the acting would be booed even on an old-time barnstorming circuit. But realism is not wanted here: Fritz Lang is working in the German tradition of Expressionismus. The aim of that movement was to thud home a thesis, usually political, with every possible device – symbolism, song, choral chant, stylised movement, decor – and a total abandonment of such traditional dramatic properties as character.The film is, for all its faults, one of our few cinematic classics, and this is because it provides icons. The visual exaggerations are metaphors that stick in the mind. Lang first saw the towers of polis when he approached the New York skyline from the sea, but his own imagined city borrows only the Babel aspect – “Let us build a tower that will reach the sky”. His pasteboard architecture chills because of its beauty: the Paternoster Tower has, in its structure as well as its name, a biblical resonance, a cathedral-like quality which announces a new religion. The worship of power and money is seen in New York not in an architectural philosophy: the skyscrapers are not bound together in an urban plan, they are each a monument to inidual thrust, and, in New York, inidualism is rampant. But in Lang’s polis inidualism is the property of one man only, the Master. We are in a totalitarian state, and the architecture is totalitarian.Lang’s vision is, of course, prophetic, but the prophecy has never been fulfilled. Hitler came to power seven years after the film was completed, but his tyranny took a form different from Joh Fredersen’s. Fredersen’s power is at least sane in the American manner. It is based on money and is totally American. There is nothing militaristic or racial in it.Film is a visual medium, and, if the task of literature is to stud the brain with quotations, cinema’s job is to cram it with images which transcend story line and feed the need for myth. There are very few films which have done this. We are told by the French post-structuralists that the writer doesn’t write: the writer is written, is controlled by the language he uses. And so Lang was controlled by the limitations of black and white, by mocked-up urban landscapes which never pretended to be real, and probably by the strange ambiguous beauty of Brigitte Helm. The film was never meant to be propaganda. Lang admits that he was primarily fascinated by machines, above all perhaps by the huge machine which is the film-making complex.When I say, though with many reservations, that polis is a movie that changed my life I perhaps really mean that it changed my childhood. “In the lost childhood of Judas,” wrote George Russell, “Christ was betrayed.” Perhaps our adult lives are nothing more than sophisticated replays of our extreme youth. The myths which nourish our childhood are implanted for ever.

I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston.

Two-nil ahead at half-time, Southgate’s team looked on course to bid farewell to Wembley in style. As it was, the England manager must have been startled by their deterioration as Nigeria, such obliging opponents throughout the opening 45 minutes, pulled one back through Alex Iwobi and had enough of the ball thereafter to think they could have saved themselves.That period was a stark reminder that England will fly to Russia on Tuesday week as very much a work in progress, pinning their hopes on a relatively inexperienced group of internationals.Overall the good outweighed the bad but it was a close-run thing at times and Southgate must wonder why his players lost their momentum after such an impressive first-half performance, featuring goals from Gary Cahill and Kane and the clear impression of a team capable of playing slick, joined-up football.They could not keep it up and that meant a rather awkward atmosphere after the final whistle when Southgate’s players gathered in the centre of the pitch for a choreographed show of togetherness.Most of the crowd had already left although the ones who had stayed behind did return the players’ applause and, on the positive side, Southgate was so encouraged by the first-half display – “an excellent performance with the ball” – it is still perfectly conceivable this will be the team that starts against Tunisia in Volgograd on 18 June.Southgate, in other words, has chosen not to employ orthodox wingers in a 3-5-2 system – or 3-3-2-2, to be entirely accurate – with Sterling operating in a central attacking position alongside Kane. Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young will be expected to provide the width as attacking full-backs. Dele Alli was chosen ahead of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, most probably because of the Tottenham Hotspur player’s understanding with Kane, and Jesse Lingard’s selection was another sign that Southgate wants two attacking midfielders who will make it their business to enter the opposition penalty area. Alli and Lingard have better scoring statistics than Loftus-Cheek and that counted in their favour.Trippier, in the right-wing-back role, demonstrated his ability to deliver pinpoint crosses with the seventh-minute corner for Cahill’s headed goal and here, too, was evidence that Southgate’s preferred system allows Sterling to exert more of an influence than if he was playing on the wing.Southgate admitted afterwards he gave serious consideration to dropping Sterling from his starting line-up because the Manchester City player reported a day late for training. Southgate decided against it because he did not want to add to the blizzard of headlines surrounding Sterling and the player looked determined to justify that decision. Sterling played as though he did not have a care in the world – a constant menace to the Nigerian defence with his speed, direct running and ability to create space for others. In the first half, anyway.Unfortunately for Sterling, he is going through one of those periods in which he seems to have a magnetic attraction to controversy and, as Southgate has acknowledged, not all the criticism is unjustified. This one came in the form of a penalty-box e seven minutes into the second half and, justifiably, he was shown a yellow card for his troubles. Sterling’s intention was to make it look as though the Nigeria goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, had brought him down when, in reality, it was the England player trying to initiate the contact. It was poor on Sterling’s part and the Italian referee, Marco Guida, did not fall into the trap.Perhaps that moment summed up England’s nervousness at the start of the second half. Nigeria were so overwhelmed during the opening 45 minutes that their manager, Gernot Rohr, brought on four substitutes straight after the interval, as well as switching to a three-man defence – and that, according to Southgate, threw his own players.Dealt effectively with most of what came his way but Ighalo’s shot for Nigeria’s goal had the 24-year-old well beaten leaving him prone for\u0026nbspThe most composed of England’s back-three despite centre-half still being an unfamiliar role. Drifted effectively into a full-back role when the opportunity allowed.\u0026nbspDidn’t inspire confidence. Nigeria’s gameplan was to float the ball over his head and it caught England short each time. Not great in possession, either.\u0026nbspA thumping header opened the scoring and gave England early confidence. Effective with his back to goal but, like Stones, he looked vulnerable on the turn.Assigned corner duties from the right, the Tottenham full-back set up England’s first goal while his delivery was also typically effective from open play.\u0026nbspAcquitted himself well as the sole central midfielder worthy of the name. Stayed cautious and read the play well, but also played a part in Kane’s goalOn the front foot in the first half with one superb through-ball to Sterling. Nigeria’s change of shape put him under pressure in the second and he was substituted.Busy in the first half and timed his forward runs well. Failed to finish two decent opportunities though and faded in the second period. Substituted late on.Looked sharp. Effective in going beyond his front man, was also comfortable receiving possession. Played through the defence numerous times.\u0026nbspFlattered to deceive. The ideas were right and the pace electric, but the final moment remains Sterling’s biggest hurdle for England. Booked for simulation to boot.\u0026nbspBarely in the game, but still scored (though his shot should have been saved). With Alli and Lingard overlapping him, the captain was often to be found dropping deep.Ruben Loftus-Cheek (for Lingard 67): Helped to solidify the middle of the park after Nigeria’s comeback. 5Danny Rose (for Young 67): Effectively shut down Nigeria’s outlet on the right. 5Danny Welbeck (for Kane 73): Bustled his way through for one half chance, but had ball picked off his toe. 5Marcus Rashford (for Sterling 73): Headed over from a Delph cross during his brief cameo. 5England had looked entirely comfortable until that point but the complexion of the game changed when Odion Ighalo, the former Watford striker, cracked a shot against the post and Iwobi fired in the rebound.England had plenty of defenders in close proximity. None could get to the ball ahead of Iwobi and suddenly the boisterous hordes of Nigerian fans behind that goal started to turn up the volume.Kane had doubled England’s lead in the 39th minute from Sterling’s pass, firing in a right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area and fortunate that Uzoho a made a pig’s ear of keeping it out.In the second half, however, England’s front two were never so threatening and, as Southgate pointed out, if they lose their focus so badly in the World Cup “it might put you out”. At least England held on, but the game drifted rather aimlessly to its conclusion and Southgate will hope for a less erratic performance when Costa Rica are the opponents in Leeds on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4d4c49634c679d2aab4402e184890a4c7b5c1d1/6_37_2209_1325/master/2209.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f938dcf2c69bd70c2fd811a48845fcb1","title":"two sides to crying game champions league final paul scholes","story":"A week on from a Champions League final that proved remarkable on many different levels and the tears have, presumably, dried. When they had been seen streaming down the faces of Loris Karius, Mo Salah and Dani Carvajal, among other grief-stricken footballers, it was intriguing that Paul Scholes found himself at something of a loss. A star guest at a viewing party in London, the former Manchester United midfielder wasn’t so much critical of these grown men being so publicly reduced to sobbing wrecks, as generally bemused by their ostentatious displays of emotion.Salah and Carvajal had left the field weeping after suffering match-ending injuries that instantly put their hopes of playing in the World Cup in jeopardy. Carvajal has since been given the all-clear for Russia, while Egypt’s star player is commendably bullish about his chances of being involved. Karius, not selected by Germany, faces a long, lonely summer of introspection following two disastrous goalkeeping blunders that cost his team the game.He was inconsolable at the final whistle and it was difficult not to empathise with him as the tears flowed and he begged for forgiveness from Liverpool’s fans. While many at the game seemed genuinely sympathetic, their keyboard-tapping counterparts were in less forgiving mood.“I can understand Karius, I suppose, he’s devastated at what’s happened, but injuries are part of the game,” said Scholes, when pushed for his views on those who had been weeping. “If you go back years and you saw somebody crying on the pitch, they’d have had a whole load of stick for it. Now it’s a different game, players are sensitive and they get upset easily.”Although Scholes stopped short of suggesting modern footballers should “man up”, the implication seemed fairly clear. However, it is worth reiterating that his comments appeared to be prompted by total bafflement by the behaviour he was witnessing far away in Kiev rather than any obvious lack of compassion. Because sporting misfortune and humiliation are not the kind of traumas that would drive him to tears, Scholes seemed mystified by the notion that it might have a more profound and tortuous effect on somebody else.Scholes was a relative stranger to humiliation throughout his illustrious career as a highly decorated midfielder but he did suffer notable misfortune. He famously missed Manchester United’s thrilling last‑gasp victory over Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final through suspension. Asked whether he had been close to tears upon seeing Urs Meier produce the yellow card that would rule him out of the final, Scholes was matter-of-fact. “No,” he said. “What’s crying going to do. It’s not going to make the booking go\u0026nbspaway.”Although the man undeniably has a point, one cannot help but wonder if he believes mourners crying at funerals do so deliberately in the faint hope it might make the body in the casket come back to life.Scholes would be completely mystified by my behaviour as somebody who cries at the drop of a hat, often in the most ridiculous and embarrassing circumstances imaginable. I have cried watching Neighbours. I have cried at the funerals of people I don’t know. I regularly cry watching movies and remain incapable of watching the closing scenes of E.T. the Extra‑Terrestrial without being reduced to a sobbing, heaving wreck. I have cried over relationship break-ups, news of a loved one’s illness, news of a loved one’s recovery, global injustices and sad montages on Comic Relief.I regularly weep at weddings and the big reveal of renovated houses on DIY\u0026nbspSOS. I once broke down over a broken-down car after burning out my clutch. I would prefer not to make a public spectacle of myself over often ridiculous things, but I simply can’t help it and that’s fine.In stark contrast, Scholesy, who is clearly made of sterner emotional stuff than me and my blubbering ilk, is better able to keep a lid on things and not given to public displays of sadness. And that’s fine, too.In an important, stirring and eloquent piece about depression and our urgent need to acknowledge it published on the Football 365 website recently, John Nicholson made the very valid point that it is perfectly acceptable to be weak. “It is part of being human, not a failure of your gender or sexuality,” he wrote. “You are no less of a man for not being able to cope sometimes, for crying at the nameless existential pain in your soul.”And although it is unfair to suggest Scholes was criticising Salah, Karius or Carvajal for succumbing to their existential pain on Saturday evening, he is undeniably part of a wider football culture in which such emotional outbursts are regularly and unfairly greeted with an unhealthy derision, and that needs to be addressed.In The Class of 92, Scholes and some of his former Manchester United team-mates spoke at length about the bullying culture prevalent at the club when they were apprentices. One horrifying tale detailed the time an adolescent Scholes was locked in an industrial‑sized laundry room tumble dryer, an experience that rendered him so traumatised that he suffered an asthma attack.One suspects he was probably not too far from tears on that occasion, even if they wouldn’t have opened the dryer door and helped him to catch his breath.Tellingly, it was he and his team-mates who made a point of putting an end to such cruelty once they had attained the necessary dressing‑room clout.For all Scholes’s bewilderment at the tears of today’s more sensitive footballers, it is hard to shake the feeling that underneath that gruff, no-nonsense northern exterior there lurks a sympathetic soul that is commendably soft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/372146211741ad64481a5c99757c95e463d18a49/4_645_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3490b1240bed7679ab48d16d096fbfa","title":"geri horner the spice girls just reflected what a lot of yong girls were feeling","story":"The singer, 45, on other people’s stories, emotional eating and finding ‘the one’ Everything I have done has been about connecting with people.

Torn rather than sliced, those jagged edges are sharp enough to grate a cut clove of the new season’s softly fragrant garlic, something I like to do when there are good tomatoes in the house for pan con tomate.I was brought up on tomatoes on toast made with sliced white Wonderloaf and tinned tomatoes, so the first time my friend James made it for me the way his grandmother did in Spain, the idea suddenly made sense. The thick, open-pored bread was baked until thoroughly crisp, rubbed with a clove of new, sweet garlic, then moistened with grated tomatoes, olive oil (we used Nuñez de Prado) and flakes of sea salt. I begged for basil, but he said no. At home, his family would probably use pan de cristal, similar to ciabatta but thinner and more crisply crusted, and with a chewier and larger-holed crumb (infinitely superior in other words). It is almost impossible to find here, but pretty much any bread is fine, as long as isn’t too dense, or brown, too crusty or too fresh.As with everything so simple, the details need to be carefully thought through. Stale bread is lighter and more airy than fresh, the olive oil needs a peppery kick and the tomatoes are best when verging on the over-ripe, so they collapse into a juicy dressing. A simple thing, perfectly executed.On a slightly more complex note, I’ve been baking this week: a savoury apricot and rosemary-scented foccacia made specifically to go with goat’s cheese. It was worth taking 10 minutes to cook the fruit before adding it to the dough, the result being silky fruit but also a fantastic apricot and rosemary-scented oil with which to moisten the baking bread. As a fruit and herb bread for a sharply lactic, snow-white cheese, it proved easy to make and difficult to beat.ciabatta or pan de cristal 200gcherry tomatoes 400g, ripe but not too sweetolive oil 4 tbspgarlic 3 or 4 cloves Split the bread lengthways. This is easiest with a very long, slim-bladed knife, but tear rather than slice if possible. Cut each half into pieces roughly 7cm x 9cm.Using a coarse-toothed grater, grate the tomatoes into a mixing bowl, then stir in the olive oil with a good pinch of sea salt.Place the bread, cut side up, on a baking sheet and brown lightly under an overhead grill, or else cut side down on a hot griddle.Peel the garlic and cut each clove in half. Rub the garlic over the surface of the toast, discarding each piece as it loses its juice, then spoon the tomato and olive oil over the toast. Trickle with a little more olive oil and serve, with more salt for those who wish it.I have long been an advocate of the baking stone – a thick piece of stone or chunky unglazed tile left in the bottom of the oven to heat up, on which to cook bread or pastry. The extra heat held by the stone ensures a crisp base to pies, loaves, tarts and foccacia. My own has done years of service both as direct heat for a pizza or loaf and as something on which to sit a baking sheet or tart tin. If you are thinking of picking one up for your oven, may I suggest the heavier the better? Whatever, they do wonders for a foccacia.For the dough:strong white bread flour 500geasy-bake yeast 1 7g sachet sea salt 1 tspolive oil 2-3 tbspwarm water 350mlapricots 400golive oil 4 tbsprosemary 3 bushy sprigsRub the bottom of a baking tin, approximately 22cm in diameter, with a little of the olive oil. Set the oven at 230Cgas mark 7.Put the flour and yeast into a large mixing bowl and crumble in the sea salt, then the olive oil and the warm water. Mix thoroughly, adding more water if necessary, to produce a soft, but not sticky dough.Generously flour a board or work surface, tip out the dough, then knead or fold gently but firmly for about 5 minutes. If you wish, use a food mixer with dough hook.When the dough feels elastic, transfer to a lightly floured bowl, cover with a cloth or clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour, until it has doubled in size.Cut the apricots in half and remove their stones. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, add the apricots and let them cook for a few minutes until they have softened. Pull the rosemary needles from their stems and add to the apricots, then set aside.Gently remove the dough from its bowl and push it into the oiled tin, pressing it out to reach the edge.Place the apricots on top of the dough then spoon over the rosemary and oil from the tin. Cover with a cloth and leave to rest in a warm place until the dough has risen almost to the top of the tin. Scatter lightly with sea salt.Bake for about 30-35 minutes until the fruit is starting to brown here and there and the dough is springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes before removing from the tin.

Tousle-haired busts gaze at gilded frames and silvery mirrors keep company with Susi’s own designs: velvet cushions, tables or lampshades in deep oranges, Borgia reds and Medici greens. Even the architecture of this five-bedroom apartment carved from a vertical slice of an Edwardian country mansion is classical: the colonnaded portico and pilasters grounded in Renaissance proportions.It reminds Bellamy of Florence, where she lived with her family for six years when her husband, an energy consultant, was posted to Italy. “I’d taken a career break to bring up our children so I had time to absorb the city… It’s that mix of old and new which I loved: the contrast of a Pucci pattern against a crumbling palazzo wall the coffee bars and the traditional shops selling gilded frames and marbled papers. It really did feel as if I’d died and gone to heaven,” she laughs.Returning to the UK in 2010, Bellamy was keen to bring some of that “ancient meets modern” combination to her home, near Newcastle. Set in a former shipping magnate’s rural pile, the apartment sits in the central section of the building. From the double-height entrance, a staircase swirls up to the first-floor sitting room, main bedroom and guest bedroom. There are three more bedrooms tucked under the eaves, a layout that suited a family with three grown-up children.But there was work to do. “I’d looked at lots of architecture in Italy and realised that some elements of the apartment didn’t work. With historic buildings you sometimes have to move on – sympathetically.” So Bellamy called the architect Ike Isenhour, who she had met in Florence. “He came to stay and we bashed out ideas in the pub.” Isenhour’s “simple” changes brought symmetry and light. The old utility room is now a corridor drawing your eye towards the new door into the sitting room. Underfoot, the original floors were oiled to a dove-grey and the oak “gentleman’s club” panelling painted taupe as a foil for evolving wall schemes: oranges, yellows, or the deep-plum of the sitting room.Bellamy had planned to use the entrance hall as a dining room – “But Ike took one look and said, ‘You’ll never use it: it’s too cold.’” Now it functions as a light-filled second sitting room where a sofa from Bellamy’s past offers a comfortable spot for the Sunday papers. Next door, the kitchen was redesigned to echo the proportions of the Edwardian architecture. The round table, a Tuscan souvenir, sits by the bay window with views across landscaped lawns to the Tyne Valley. This is where Bellamy, who launched her design business in 2016 (to the approval of buyers from Liberty and Heal’s), works using pens, paints and inks to create distinctive prints and patterns.The peaceful corner is a world away from her first job as fashion editor at Brides magazine, zipping Kate Moss into nuptial whites and chasing Jimmy Choo for heels (“He’d turn up with a pair he’d made that morning, smelling of glue.”) That team spirit of collaborating with designers is echoed in pieces Bellamy commissioned for the house. “I love ping-ponging ideas about to produce something different,” she says. She designed the abstract rug in the hallway with her friend, the interior designer Eve Waldron. Raskl, in Newcastle, made the leather-clad wardrobes in the bedroom and colourful mirrors which bounce light into the sitting room. On the top floor, where bedrooms are lined in Bellamy’s marbled wallpapers to evoke the feel of jewel boxes, the hallway glows with gold-stencilled motifs inspired by Lanvin’s 1920s bedroom in Paris.The art, too, “has a meaning a personal connection”. There is a painting by Bellamy’s cousin, Vivien Geddes, which once hung at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and drawings by her émigré aunt and uncle who taught Bellamy, “a nice Jewish girl from Cardiff”, how to paint. In 2015 she did an MA in fine art at Northumbria University: “I was the 49-year-old surrounded by 21-year-olds. It forced me to throw out preconceptions and experiment.” But it was in Florence that she “served her apprenticeship”, practising life drawing, copying Old Masters like the Van Dyck which hangs in the bedroom, or making her Madonna collages, “reappropriated versions” of Catholic street shrines.At 54, Bellamy is experiencing something of a midlife renaissance with orders from designers and stockists in Japan, Scandinavia and Russia. “Even now I am still very ambitious but I’m aware that I need to move forward before it’s too late,” she says. In September, she is back in Florence for a solo show at the Palazzo Tornabuoni. On days off she has earmarked her favourite coffee bars and paper shops there will be trips to gaze at triptychs and educational window shopping on piazzi where, one day, she dreams of opening her own store."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d448314f1fd55ae5a409a072141edf81c543d2f3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c86556758fb74fd0b2207b1fdb798332","title":"the 10 best terrazzo items for the home in pictures","story":"Chip in.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f03cbc57766d6fd01351b3481d35e44ea003237/0_86_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaed485f901db6506f8d94cdf8437145","title":"low paid face decade wage squeeze","story":"The wages of 10 million low-paid workers have stalled for two decades and face pressure for a decade to come, according to a bleak assessment of Britain’s future jobs market.Global economic competition, automation, the shift to the gig economy and a widening regional ide will see further pressure placed on the incomes of those earning between £10,000 and £15,000, it warns.The analysis by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) thinktank, which is on the political right and chaired by the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, also blamed a chronic national failure to boost skills and education. It will be seen as another warning to Theresa May from Conservative figures to kickstart her domestic agenda. There have been concerns within the party that the focus on Brexit has led to inaction in other crucial areas that could hold Britain back after its exit from the European Union.The analysis, co-written by Boris Johnson’s former economic adviser and Brexit supporter Gerard Lyons, concludes that wages of those on the lowest salaries stalled long before the 2008 financial crash. It warns that the current evidence shows that most never escape a life on low pay. The centre’s support for action on low pay shows that it is now an issue of concern across the political spectrum, with automation expected to place further pressure on jobs in some low-paid sectors unless new skills and opportunities are developed.Britain does not compare well with other developed nations when it comes to low pay, it states. Taking data from manufacturing, and giving the US a score of 100, Switzerland topped the table with a pay rate of 155, followed by Norway on 126, Germany on 111 and France on 97. However, the UK was much further behind, on 73.While the report shares concerns about low pay, it argues that the UK should prepare for automation by stripping back taxes and regulation. “The biggest opportunity for the UK is to unleash the potential of the private sector, particularly small and medium-sized firms, helped by lower regulations and taxes,” it states.“The wider macroeconomic environment has driven some of these changes. Globalisation has added to intense competition, suppressing costs and wage growth.”It warns of the reliance of the UK economy on the financial sector, Britain’s continuing budget deficit and the regional imbalances between London and the rest of the country.Half the people employed in so-called elementary occupations, such as bar staff, clerks, care workers and labourers, are on low pay, as defined by two-thirds of the median income of £25,000 a year.It urges a skills overhaul to deal with the coming pressures. The authors conclude: “The British labour market has changed significantly in the last 20 years. There are more people in work than at any time on record, driven partially by a growth in the number of women entering the\u0026nbspworkforce, the increase in the number of people working part-time, people working far longer into old age, and a large influx of workers from abroad.“This far more erse workforce is\u0026nbspincreasingly employed in the service sector, as manufacturing has continued to cut the number of workers, and mobility between low-paid, low-skilled jobs and high-paid, high-skilled jobs seems to be decreasing.”Other research suggests there is better news for those on low pay. The Resolution Foundation thinktank recently found that a smaller proportion of UK workers are low paid now than at any time since the early 1980s, due to above-inflation increases in the government’s national living wage. The national minimum wage has risen from £6.70\u0026nbspin 2016 to £7.50 in 2017 and £7.83 from April 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0927bb150b128ceea9ac7a7f4c9e8a549c509e63/0_125_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57962b7fbf3c0921ad61e15959de4a01","title":"david miliband i would join any campaign against any brexit deal","story":"The former foreign secretary says there should be a second vote on BrexitDavid Miliband has said he would take part in any campaign to vote against the terms of any Brexit deal but has no plans to return to the cut and thrust of UK politics.Miliband, who has been based in New York as president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) since 2013, is still seen as a future leader of the Labour party and has never categorically ruled it out.He was asked at the Hay literary festival in Wales whether, if there was ever a public vote on the terms of a Brexit deal, he would be part of a campaign to reject it. “Of course,” he said. “I tried to campaign last time, I hope I’d campaign more effectively next time.”Miliband, the former foreign secretary, said it was important to him to be in a job where he could make the most impact.The 17,000 people working for the IRC also needed to know, he said, that he was focused “on doing my job today for them”.Miliband argues there should be a second vote on Brexit, partly on the grounds that what people voted for is not going to happen.He said the first referendum should not have taken place and reminded the Hay audience that it was Margaret Thatcher, quoting Clement Attlee, who said a referendum was a device used by “dictators and demagogues”.The remain campaign leading up to the 2016 vote was a flawed one. “David Cameron became the leading cheerleader of the remain side, but he had spent the previous 20 years attacking the European Union,” said Miliband.He said the government, 780 days after the vote, still had no policy on trade, regulation or market access. “The negotiations to unscramble the eggs of social, of economic, of environmental integration with Europe are going to go on for five or 10 years.”Miliband said Brexit was squeezing the life out of politics in the UK and preventing “the social and economic reform we desperately need”.He criticised Theresa May for not setting up a cross-party coalition to campaign to get the best outcome for the UK but also said it was not enough for the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to stand aside and “let events take their course.”Miliband was asked about accusations of antisemitism in the Labour party – the “purest and oldest and most disgusting” example of racism, he said – and called on people to stay and fight. “It completely grieves me,” he said. “I never believed I would see the day when antisemitism and the Labour party were in the same sentence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e274792cb07b3f3d3ac8ef01c1549431ffc4f16/29_184_4312_2589/master/4312.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f25a537e50236aae66337ef1a51616","title":"replace theresa may with michael gove tory donor says brexit uk news","story":"Government should be bolder in talks with Brussels, Leave campaign backer Crispin Odey claimsMichael Gove should be installed as the new Tory leader because Theresa May has shown that she cannot “carry Brexit through”, a major party donor has publicly warned.In a stark sign of the frustration among prominent Brexit supporters over the government’s handling of negotiations with the EU, Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who backed the Leave campaign, said he believed the environment secretary had the skills to make a success of Britain’s exit and appeal to voters.Odey, whose most recent donation to the Conservative party was a £50,000 gift before last year’s general election, said the government needed to be far bolder in its attitude to Brussels. It should be learning from the new Italian populist coalition government, which has plans that would defy EU rules on debt, he said, suggesting that Britain should start breaching EU rules by pursuing policies such as signing trade deals. He also backed a change in leadership.“We’ve got to have that self-confidence to make breaches,” he told the Observer. “There’s no point in voting for freedom if you don’t know what to do when you’re free. What is true is that you have a whole lot of people who didn’t want this to happen who are in charge of it happening.“I would go to Gove. He’s the only minister who is still being a minister. Michael has got lots of attributes that make him a non-traditional Tory. He is very aware that he has to appeal not just to the wealthy, but also more broadly. I don’t think May can carry Brexit through any more.”He added: “Italy has confronted the EU – they’ve said they will go ahead and be in breach of its rules.“We should say, ‘we’ve got to have life after this, so we’re creating that life. We are creating trade agreements which are in breach of everything, because we won’t be in breach by the time you come to take us to court’. That’s how Elizabeth I would have been leading with this.”His backing for Gove risks reigniting the Tory debate about May’s leadership, with some Brexiters worried that Britain could end up being locked into a customs union with the EU that would prevent it pursuing an independent trade policy. In reality, few Tory MPs want an unpredictable leadership election which could further destabilise the party. However, a challenge to May’s leadership could emerge should pro-Brexit MPs conclude there is a better alternative.Gove was one of the figureheads of the successful Vote Leave campaign. His botched attempt to succeed David Cameron in 2016 saw him widely condemned by Tory MPs for betraying Boris Johnson, whose leadership bid he had been supporting. He was then sacked from the frontbench by May. However, he has been enjoying something of a renaissance since returning to the cabinet as environment secretary last year. “No other politician could have made such an impact in that job,” said an ally.A source close to Gove said the environment secretary was “fully supportive of the prime minister and will continue to be so”. He added: “He believes it’s vital we get behind our prime minister to deliver the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.”Odey, who has also donated to Ukip in the past, said he believed that May was a gifted technocrat, but questioned her handling of Brexit. “The European Union are not good at hitting a moving ball,” he said. “The problem is, Theresa May is not good at hitting a moving ball, either.“As someone said about May, she should have joined the civil service, rather than becoming a politician. She is perfect for that, but she can’t make a decision. So there is no leadership.“We should be reaching out to Italy. We should be saying that we have so many of the same problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd3e78403ab8bd2b68a74f7dbb596df4d80ceec/0_446_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=445cc95fabb8716f2a9b176bfab9f277","title":"doreen lawrence grenfell tenants faced institutional indifference","story":"Doreen Lawrence has attacked the “institutional indifference” faced by the residents of Grenfell Tower and others living in social housing.The campaigner, whose son, Stephen Lawrence, was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, writes in the Observer that the indifference of the authorities to Grenfell residents meant “they had no right to safety and no right to be heard”.She adds: “Very few people in positions of power understand what this experience is like. I doubt they’ve ever had to live in poor housing or know what it is like to feel invisible, like no\u0026nbspone cares.”Baroness Lawrence fought for years against a discriminatory and complacent police response to her son’s murder. In 1999, a public inquiry concluded that the police were institutionally racist, in a report which was expected to reset race relations in Britain.Now Lawrence has drawn a “striking parallel” between that inquiry and the public inquiry into the Grenfell fire, which is due to begin hearing evidence this week. In both inquiries, she says, “race and class play an undeniable part”.For the past two weeks, relatives of the 72 people who died as a result of the fire have been giving testimony in a preliminary session of the inquiry. In the presence of Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the chair, painful accounts of the lives of those who died have reduced many to tears.Lawrence says she has “listened intently” to the heartbreaking stories. “I understand acutely the pain of those speaking out about their loss. Sitting in a public inquiry day after day, talking about your own grief while the world watches, is a very difficult thing to do. I know it really took its toll on me.“But these people are doing something essential: they are finally putting names, faces, hopes and dreams to the 72 victims who, until now, have otherwise been a number. For that bravery and truth, we are all grateful.”She commends the relatives for harnessing their anger, saying: “It was the same for me when I was fighting for justice for my son Stephen, after he was murdered. My anger became my motivation it kept me driving forwards for years.”The institutional indifference faced by the Grenfell Tower community spreads to all residents of social housing, she says. “It’s the same indifference which too often sees dismissive landlords protected by a system that allows them to ignore social tenants’ fears and concerns.”Stigma towards social tenants is “still very much alive and well, and it’s the main reason these tenants can end up being ignored”.Recalling her own years in social housing, she says: “We need to look again at the basic deal which those who need social housing are offered. A social home should be a home and an opportunity to get on – as I did – and somehow we have lost sight of that.”Lawrence is serving on a commission established by the homelessness charity Shelter to scrutinise the state and role of social housing in the aftermath of the fire. The panel includes Edward Daffarn, a resident of the tower, whose blog predicted a catastrophic fire Ed Miliband, the former Labour party leader and the Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi.Chaired by Mike Long, the minister of the Notting Hill Methodist church, close to the tower, the commission’s recommendations are expected to be presented to the prime minister before the end of the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc4e87b652521547b5423877168e33e17c52e0d/9_424_5459_3274/master/5459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50549c0ba720c14bbef393d6a2ef26ed","title":"obesity food poverty cheap bread","story":"Cinnamon Square craft bakery, in a historic building in Rickmansworth, near Watford, has been full of children on their half-term break learning the ancient art of proving and kneading dough.Its owner, Paul Barker, likes to set a test to help them see how different “real” bread is from the white, sliced factory loaf most of them are used to. Take a piece of white sliced and rub it in your hands it quickly turns in to a grey, tacky ball that looks as unappetising as old chewing gum. Try the same with a well-made loaf and it just breaks in to crumbs. Think about the chewing-gum-like lump in your stomach. You may be able to buy a large loaf of that for as little as 45p in the supermarket, but how much good will it do you?“We focus on time – it takes anything from 27 hours to 152 hours to make one of our loaves. The bread is more nutritious, more flavoursome and more digestible. The children are so not used to it, but they are converted,” Barker said. He has passed on his award-winning bread-making skills to more than 12,000 children to date, visiting primary and secondary schools as well as giving classes in his bakery.This inequality gap has grown much bigger in the past decade. Obesity is a disease of poverty, much as cholera was in the 19th century. It does not exclusively affect the poor, and rates are going up across the board, but those who live in deprived areas have far less chance of escaping it – or the catalogue of diseases that come with it, from cancer to diabetes.Researchers studying this “social gradient in overweight” across different countries see a pattern emerging. Obesity is a form of malnutrition, they argue, and the greater the structural inequality within a society, the more that people living under financial and social constraints lack the opportunities for an active, healthy life.Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, says: “The simple matter is that obesity is usually the province of socio-economic grades D and E, who cannot afford fruit and vegetables even when they know about good diet, so they feed their families highly processed food, which is less nutritious.”How we now make our bread – a staple for centuries – sums up the problems of a society where healthy eating comes at a price that is just too high for many. “I don’t touch white sliced bread myself,” said Fry, “but it’s cheap, and you can stuff something cheap between it, which may also be highly processed and unhealthy, and call it a sandwich, a meal. There is a distinct difference between the lower and the middle-class larder.”Barker makes bread the way it has been made for generations, using just well-milled flour, yeast, water, and a little salt. Bread like this is called the staff of life because it contains so many vital nutrients: essential fats, fibre, protein, more than 20 vitamins and minerals, and carbohydrates. Since staples by definition account for a large proportion of our intake, if the staple of the diet is healthy, it is much easier to ensure that the diet overall is healthy. But the nutritional gulf between a well-made wholemeal loaf and a white-sliced factory one is enormous.When whole wheat is milled into white flour, the vitamins and minerals are reduced by more than half. The essential-oil-rich germ, which has the greatest concentration of nutrients, is sold off as animal feed. Concern that over-refining might be leaving humans malnourished compared with their livestock was first raised in 1919, and eventually governments required millers to put back a few of the vitamins and minerals through fortification, although they are not restored to the levels found in wholemeal flour.It was in the early 1960s that scientists at the British Baking Industries Research Association in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, developed a way of making bread that dispensed with the time required by traditional methods.They found air and water could be incorporated into dough if it was mixed at very high speeds in mechanical mixers. It needed double the quantity of yeast to make it rise, and chemical oxidants to get the gas in, and hardened fat to provide structure – without the fat the bread collapsed, in early experiments.Since flavour develops during proving, the new loaf needed more salt to make it taste of something. It also needed emulsifiers to plug the gaps, enabling the dough to retain more air. The process removed labour, reduced costs and gave much higher yields of bread from each sack of flour because the dough absorbed so much more water. The chemicals needed are now mostly incorporated into a premix of additives with soya flour, and labelled as “flour treatment agents”. Extra pure gluten is added to strengthen the flour so it can survive the factory process. This Chorleywood bread process is now ubiquitous, and just three giant baking companies dominate the British market.White bread like this has a glycaemic index score of around 70 (the GI index measures how rapidly food triggers a rise in blood sugar and the release of insulin). Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates over-stimulates insulin production, leading to blood-sugar highs and lows, which leave you feeling hungry and liable to overeat. Wholemeal bread scores only 50. Stoneground wholemeal is lower still at 30. The slower release of its energy keeps you feeling full longer.On health grounds the choice between the two should be simple. But Barker’s bread costs £2.45 for a large white, and more than £4 for a large speciality wheat and rye loaf. A supermarket white sliced loss leader can cost just 45p. And this is only one example of the poor being routinely priced out of healthier food.Whatever the government comes up with this week, Elizabeth Dowler, professor emerita at Warwick University, who has researched food poverty for the government, says better wages must be part of any solution. Which should mean less cheap bread in shopping baskets.“Obesity is the canary in the mine. It tells us there is something seriously wrong with not just the food system but the whole economic system. When you talk to poor parents about how they manage on very low incomes, you learn that they have so little that food is a long, long way down the list. Unless you address the social contexts in which people live, you’ll never really tackle obesity. What they are up against will continue to defeat them.”Felicity Lawrence is author of Not on the Label (Penguin, £9.99).The price of a basic sliced white loaf – fifth of the cost of a traditionally made white loaf from a specialist bakerNumber of vitamins and minerals in a non-processed loaf of bread which, with essential fats, fibre, protein and carbohydrates, make up what we need for good healthThe number of British four- and five-year-olds who are severely obese when they start schoolGlycaemic index score for a basic loaf of processed white bread its wholemeal equivalent scores 50 and stoneground wholemeal 30"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9403cef1235a1216b31a9eebb1511d869b33a83/0_82_3185_1911/master/3185.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2507d9798e035fdb2e9ce5db92688352","title":"cricket england pakistan second test match report","story":"• Second Test, day two: Pakistan 174 England 302-7• Bess top-scores with 49 as hosts take complete controlEngland ended a rain-shortened day in a dominant position on 302 for seven, even if they got there by an unusual route. When the sun finally made an appearance in the last session, the home team’s lead had been extended to 128 runs with three wickets remaining. Yet not a single batsman managed to post a half-century, the highest score being Dom Bess’s 49 in his first role as a nightwatchman.The highest Test score achieved without a batsman hitting 50 is 315, made by England in Trinidad in 1986 – though on that occasion the extras tally went beyond 50. Here the bowling was not so terrifying as that of the West Indians of that era and, unlike the match at the Queen’s Park Oval, England have a very good chance of winning at Headingley. Pakistan were frustrated on Saturday but only by a sequence of little partnerships.Joe Root and Bess had added another 32 together before England’s captain was caught behind. Mohammad Amir had passed his outside edge several times, eliciting an impish, eloquent grin from Root, which seemed to say: “A fine delivery, my good man but this is Headingley and I’m still here”. However, there were no smiles when he feathered an attempted cover drive off Amir.Root had given the impression that he was enjoying batting with Bess they scurried between the wickets mischievously, stealing singles, provoking overthrows and then smiling at one another between overs. No doubt Bess was on cloud nine to be batting with his captain while Root may have seen a glimpse of his own youth in the fearless zest of his young partner. They were not at work, but at play.When Dawid Malan joined Bess it was far from obvious who was the nightwatchman. In between the odd sweetly timed boundary, Bess was easily knocking the ball wide of mid-on for another single. Of course he is a bit of a fraud as a nightwatchman. Consider some of his predecessors – Jimmy Anderson, Matthew Hoggard, Pat Pocock and Derek Underwood – and we can admire their bravery under fire rather than the felicity of their strokeplay. Bess is in a different league to these doughty souls – as a batsman.After this impressive start to his Test career, the 20-year-old Bess is in danger of becoming another English spinner who is actually a better batsman than bowler. For the moment we can only conclude that he is a damn fine cricketer, who has that rare and wondrous capacity to enjoy himself out there without feeling any of the burdens that usually come with the intense scrutiny of a Test match. Bess’s batting is based on sound orthodoxy. He goes back, rather than across, as the bowler hits his delivery stride, but he does this rhythmically enough to get forward if necessary he scores freely square on the off side and likes to cover-drive. Occasionally he innovated once he walked down the pitch to Mohammad Abbas and nonchalantly clipped the ball through midwicket for three. At the other end Malan must have been impressed since he immediately wandered down the pitch himself before delivering a crisp straight drive, a sincere form of flattery from the older man.This was an important knock for Malan, whose most significant innings in Test cricket have been in Australia. He averages only 20 in England and his status is slipping. He started scratchily but his stiff-armed strokeplay began to bear fruit he deftly deflected leg-breaks from Shadab Khan in between the odd drive to the boundary off the pacemen. But he could not deliver a major innings. Amir was recalled after tea and his first ball bounced surprisingly Malan prodded and could only fend the ball to first slip.Meanwhile, Bess’s burgeoning reputation as a batsman was reflected by the fact Pakistan wasted a review against him when Amir struck a pad. Soon afterwards, when he needed just a single to record his second Test fifty, Bess edged a high-bouncing leg-break to slip, where Asad Shafiq held a fine catch.So there was the tantalising combination of Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler in harness, an alliance that was bound to keep bums on seats all around the ground. Their partnership flickered to the tune of 48 runs but, just before the new ball was due, Bairstow edged a fine delivery from Faheem Ashraf to the keeper.Buttler remained and was threatening after his rapid start. He hit three consecutive fours off Shadab, the second of which passed through the hands of Hasan Ali at midwicket. Soon afterwards Buttler was hit on the head by a Hasan bouncer but otherwise there were no dramas for him. In fact he played with commendable restraint against the seamers armed with the new ball.The Buttler experiment is looking very promising and worthwhile. We are witnessing him rediscovering how to play red-ball cricket in a Test match. Not many cricketers could contemplate doing that but such is his talent there is an increasingly good chance it might work. Whatever the outcome it is beguiling to watch this experiment unfold. He looked a class act as he ended up unbeaten on 34. Perhaps he can be the man to post that elusive half-century in this innings. Sam Curran, who in his first Test innings crunched two eye-catching boundaries in the final over, may have the same ambition."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc67fbc9e59e1b57c8e03ad5d5a4e661c7e7079/345_15_4131_2480/master/4131.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785755edff1d6dfa2cbf904847341cbb","title":"mako vunipola england south africa tour","story":"After a gruelling year the Saracens prop should be resting but instead is off to South Africa for England’s three-Test seriesA year ago this weekend Mako Vunipola was on the Lions’ bench for the opening match of their New Zealand tour and was pressed into action nine minutes into the second half to head off the prospect of an unthinkable defeat by a side scavenged from the lower reaches of the professional game in the land of the World Cup holders. The England prop has made 35 appearances since then and, in an age when player welfare is talked about constantly, he should be resting his feet somewhere unspoiled by rugby posts.He duly boarded a plane this weekend, on tour but not a tourist. His campaign has another month to run with England, in need of redemption in South Africa for a three-Test series after slumping to fifth in the Six Nations and conceding 63 points to the Barbarians last Sunday. And so Vunipola – who had two rest weekends last season, one at the beginning – trudges on, not that the 27-year-old is complaining.“I did not have the best pre-season and had a slow start with Saracens, understandably, but the year has been OK,” says Vunipola, the man of the match last weekend when Saracens defeated Exeter at Twickenham to reclaim the Premiership title. “What has pleased me the most is being involved and having the opportunity to play so many games. Fortunately I have been injury-free.“The hardest part of the season was midway through the Six Nations. It was not so much that I felt my tank was getting low but the disappointment at losing matches. It was hard to lift myself going back to Saracens and the transition back to club rugby was tough. We talked about it as a group of players and looked on it as an opportunity to get better which, I think, we did.”Vunipola played at the end of the season as if it were the beginning and was named the man of the match in the semi-final victory over Wasps and in the final when, in 30C heat, he lasted 75 minutes and covered more ground with the ball in hand than any other forward and made 18 tackles.His scrummaging, once perceived as a weakness that would stunt his international growth, has improved as the importance of the set piece has diminished. But his value lies in his contribution in the loose, where he acts like an extra back-row forward.“I would have given myself a seven out of 10 in the play-off matches,” he says. “I could have done better in one or two scrums and at times got back into the game quicker but overall it was pretty pleasing.”When it is put to him that he made the game look easy with his perpetual motion and constant involvement, he replies: “It is not. I am fortunate to have great team-mates. I just push hard in the scrum and whatever comes after that is a bonus.”There is likely to be some scrum pushing in South Africa, one of the few countries who still regard the set piece as something more than cosmetic. They have recalled Bismarck du Plessis, who was in South Africa’s World Cup-winning squad in 2007, when Eddie Jones was a consultant for the Springboks, while a survivor from the 2009 series victory over the Lions, Tendai Mtawarira, is approaching 100 caps at loosehead prop.“South Africans pride themselves on how physical they are,” says Vunipola. “That will be the first and foremost challenge for us as a team. They are a very emotional people who wear their hearts on their sleeves and we know we are going to have to be ready in the opening 20 minutes of the first Test when, with a new coach and a new team, they will come out with guns blazing.“I am fortunate at Saracens to have played alongside some great South Africans. They are the nicest people off the field but on it they will do everything to intimidate you and gain the upper hand. Schalk Brits and Schalk Burger have given me a few hints about what to watch out for, and they epitomise how rugby there is played: it is scary some of the things they can do, skilful but first and foremost they want to hurt you with massive tackles.”Vunipola will take his body into the fray for a final month before getting July off but, when he returns, he faces more than 13 months of rugby, with the World Cup in Japan looming in September next year. “When I was younger, I did not realise how much effort you have to put in at the start of a week to get yourself right,” he says. “As I’ve got older, I know my body better and what I need to do. I never go up to the coaches and say I am not quite up to it today because I would feel guilty watching other players work. I just enjoy playing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4fd4b42309ad44898e004c62c885712d225d68/0_49_1936_1162/master/1936.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8e5817e4872231c994e6f9029ff108","title":"maria sharapova blows away pliskova to lay down french open marker","story":"The cold war is over. Serena Williams, husbanding as much diplomatic warmth as she deemed appropriate, inferred strongly before her blockbuster match here on Monday against Maria Sharapova that her Russian rival had been indulging in fake news.Williams on Saturday beat Julia Görges 6-3, 6-4 to go through to the fourth round, not long after Sharapova had blitzed the sixth seed, Karolina Pliskova, 6-2, 6-1 in under an hour. Later, after batting away a couple of innocuous questions about her daughter, Olympia, Williams was confronted with a 14-year-old remark by Donald Trump that “Maria’s shoulders were incredibly alluring and ... you were intimidated by her supermodel good looks”. Pausing, she replied: “I can’t say I have been intimidated by anyone.”That became blindingly apparent as she opened up both barrels, ever so quietly. “We are both on a comeback for two totally different reasons. She’s been on her journey for over a year and I just started mine a couple months ago. It’s something new and different. I don’t know what else to say.”Yes, she did. Asked about passages in Sharapova’s recent book in which she intimated the reason Williams has dominated the Russian in 19 of their 21 matches over 14 years was because Williams was so distraught at losing to her in the 2004 Wimbledon final she cried in the locker room, Williams looked surprised.“It would be more shocking if I wasn’t in tears. I do have emotions and I wear them on my sleeve. I’m human. What happens there should definitely maybe stay there and not necessarily talk about it in a not‑so‑positive way in a book.”On Monday’s fourth-round match – the most anticipated of the tournament – she said: “Quite frankly, she’s probably a favourite. She’s been playing for over a year now. I just started. I’m just trying to get my bearings. This will be another test. This is one of her best surfaces, and she always does really, really well here.” Except when playing Williams, to whom she lost in the 2013 final.She continued: “I don’t have any negative feelings towards her. It was a little disappointing to see in that hearsay book. Especially having a daughter, I feel negativity is taught. Women, especially, should bring each other up.“A lot of people always assume that I feel a different way and it’s not true. You know, if anything, I feel like we should encourage each other and the success of one female should be the inspiration to another. I have said that a thousand times. I always get inspired by other women that are doing well.“Before her incident of drugs or not, I just feel she was doing good. Now she’s doing well again, and I have never had any hard feelings toward her. Whenever I play her, obviously I go out there the way I play everyone else. I go extremely hard. I don’t play anyone different. I play everyone so hard because they play me really hard, and I always have to be ready for it.“As a fan, I was really excited for it to come out and I was really happy for her. And then the book was a lot about me. I was surprised about that, to be honest. I didn’t expect to be reading a book about me that wasn’t necessarily true. I didn’t know she looked up to me that much or was so involved in my career.Without abusing the metaphor, Williams had the ultimate cornerman on court in Mike Tyson, who was there cheering for her on Saturday evening. “Seeing him there is always pretty cool. He was obviously such a great champion.”Whatever the verbal heat generated, Williams is probably right in her assessment of her next match. It would be one of her best career triumphs to overcome Sharapova again, at 36 and in the early stages of her comeback. For Sharapova, losing would be another devastating blow – and might underpin her extraordinary will to win against all odds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/421f3e51e67623ea9baaa122d3631b39751dccc0/164_103_4975_2985/master/4975.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5013a53c87052c4ff3b311c3a7f89a1d","title":"south africa wales summer international match report","story":"This was the match barely anyone in the American capital knew was happening, the Washington Post failing to carry a single word to preview Wales’s clash against South Africa. With both sides fielding youthful teams, critics had slammed the encounter pre-match as a money-spinning PR stunt which devalued international rugby.But there are always two sides to every coin and in time this game – which Wales edged thanks to Ryan Elias’s dramatic late try – will do the younger players on both sides the world of good in their career development. It was some finale.Wales scored tries through Hallam Amos and Tomos Williams, South Africa responding through their wing pair, Travis Ismaiel and Makazole Mapimpi. Gareth Anscombe and Elton Jantjies kicked the rest of the points but, with South Africa looking set to win late on, Elias ensured it was an American dream for Warren Gatland’s youngsters as he scored a third try after Williams charged down a clearing kick that then bounced off another South Africa defender before Elias ed on it.South Africa’s squad contained only 159 caps, with 13 of their 23 representing their country for the first time. Wales were slightly better off the scrum-half Williams was making his debut but George North won his 74th cap, at centre.A humid Washington afternoon gave way to the forecast rain pre-match, tricky conditions contributing to what was a woeful opening. Anscombe pushed an early penalty effort wide and although both sides seemed keen to throw the ball around the error count was high, boot dominated the game and Wales did not help themselves with sloppy errors.North needlessly tackled Ivan van Zyl in the air and Anscombe missed touch, and South Africa moved ahead when Amos was smashed by Jason Jenkins and Wales went off their feet at the ruck. Elton Jantjies kicked the resulting penalty to open the scoring.The first quarter would hardly have attracted any American fans to rugby such was its paucity of quality. As Wales struggled for continuity their wing Steffan Evans was tackled by his opposite number Travis Ismaiel and limped from the field.Hadleigh Parkes replaced Evans and made an immediate impact, shifting into the centre and pushing North into Evans’ place on the left wing. It soon paid idends.Wales went straight on the attack, Parkes making a lovely break with Ross Moriarty and the captain, Ellis Jenkins, involved before Amos sold the South Africa defence a wonderful dummy to e over. Anscombe converted and it was soon double trouble for the Springboks.Williams wriggled over from close range to mark his first game in style, Anscombe once again kicking the extras, and a 14-3 interval lead would have delighted Gatland, especially after his team’s struggles early on.Wales had won a vital penalty right at the end of the first period with South Africa on the attack, but they sloppily let their opponents back into the game when it resumed.Trying to play from inside the 22 Parkes shifted the ball to Amos whose pass was intercepted by the rushing Ismaiel who was left with a stroll to the line. Jantjies kicked the goal.Anscombe responded with a penalty of his own – the decision to go for the posts jeered by the American crowd – to give Wales some breathing room and then missed with another long-range effort, before the young centre Owen Watkin was shown a yellow card to set up a nerve-jangling\u0026nbspfinish.Jantjies chipped ahead and Watkin was adjudged via the TMO to have deliberately tipped the ball out of play. It was the right decision and also a possible penalty try.It nonetheless gave South Africa a one-man advantage which they utilised immediately the ball was spread left from the resulting scrum where Mapimpi ed over. Jantjies’ conversion from wide out tied the\u0026nbspgame.It was all South Africa – even with Watkin back on the field – but Wales’ young guns showed impressive game management and no little fight to stay in the contest.There was a dramatic conclusion too, as with replacements flooding the field, South Africa won a late scrum penalty in front of the posts. Robert Du Preez, who had only just replaced Jantjies, stepped up to kick the goal which looked to have won the game.But the drama continued and Wales promptly went up the other end and Williams charged down Du Preez’s clearance, the ball falling to Elias who scored his team’s crucial third try which his team celebrated in style."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce60288cd36a3fe7895dbe2a6f2a09822bd0c5c/0_14_3556_2134/master/3556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5598e42b89d6fbea7205dc5c33520a","title":"us national spelling bee facial expressions in pictures","story":"Competitors in the Scripps National Spelling Bee often struggle to contain their emotions when asked to spell obscure or complicated words.

(A cursory internet search revealed that she had been so described more than a dozen times in the last few years).I do wonder whether her ubiquity on television and radio might have had some bearing on this elevation. From an early morning yomping programme on Radio 4 on Saturday (a bit bloody hearty for 6.10), to seemingly every major sporting occasion, not to mention Trooping the Colour and Crufts, she’s more omnipresent even than the oleaginous Gary Lineker.Surely the BBC must have a “ersity agenda committee” to encourage different faces, different voices. Apparently not. I admit that my list of national treasures stretches to the Ashmolean, Ironbridge, the Victory and Wren’s St Bride’s church off Fleet Street (declaration of interest – I was married there). Ms Balding, fine though she is, is not fit to be bracketed with these gems.One man who would rightly blench if he were ever described as a national treasure is the incomparable Jonathan Meades, a one-man debunker of pomposity and cant. His BBC4 programme on jargon was gloriously bracing, acerbic, excoriating and coruscating. The advance notice promised lots of sweary action – he didn’t disappoint. Rather, it was full of aperçus - “slang mocks jargon crawls on its belly” jargon is for “people who can’t think for themselves, programmed morons, seething bubos”. Politicians have a “contempt for the language of the people they’re supposed to govern”.The richest parts dealt with the tabloid press, tabloid television and, most joyously, football, especially the effects of one player nutmegging another. I’m only sorry he didn’t address the ludicrous phrase “stonewall penalty”, coined, I’m convinced, by Alan Hansen. He reserved especial and welcome spleen for art curators and installation artists, a scabrous crew in his just estimation. As for his opinion on Nicholas Serota... reports of any recent sightings of the chair of the Arts Council will be welcome after Meades’s broadside. He must have gone into hiding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58b87f170970526fb6c238f1efe7ee971246c95/143_0_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63fb604512f473664eac481226fc3da7","title":"egypt abdel fatah al sisi sworn in second term amid crackdown on dissent","story":"MPs gather for pompous ceremony that follows arrests targeting opponents and criticsThe Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has been sworn in for a second term, following a fresh round of arrests targeting opponents and critics.“Egypt can fit us all with all our differences. Accepting others and creating common ground will be important for us in order to create political development,” he told MPs who had gathered to witness his oath of office, following a ceremony heavy on military pomp. Some interrupted his speech to shout their admiration of the president, including one MP who recited a poem of praise.Sisi’s inauguration follows a renewed crackdown on even the most benign opposition to his rule. In recent weeks, at least six prominent dissidents have been arrested and detained in pre-dawn raids. Twenty-two people protesting against a fare hike on the Cairo metro were arrested and investigated on terrorism charges, including joining a banned group. As Sisi took the oath of office, the arrests of recent weeks indicated that his second term may allow even less space for dissent than his first. Since coming to power in 2013, Sisi’s rule has been marked by efforts to crush all forms of dissent, with his government targeting Islamists, critics, activists, human rights organisations and journalists. But with almost no public opposition remaining, he is working to shore up support within an already compliant system. More than 200 MPs in Egypt’s rubber-stamp parliament have switched allegiances to a new political party, Future of the Homeland, founded to support Sisi and drawing comparisons with the corrupt National Democratic Party of deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Its creation is a possible precursor to an anticipated referendum that would alter the constitution to extend presidential terms, removing limits and allowing Sisi to become “president for life”.The opulent inauguration followed a wave of arrests of dissidents including the blogger Wael Abbas, labour lawyer and socialist activist Haytham Mohamadeen, satirist Shady Abu Zeid, activist Shady al-Ghazaly Harb and outspoken former Sisi supporter Hazem Abd al-Azim. It also includes activist Amal Fathy, who made a video discussing sexual harassment in Egypt. “Sisi is expecting a turbulent second mandate so he needs the opposition forces to be under control while unchecked voices are silenced,” said Fathy’s husband, Mohamed Lotfy, the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. The French journalist Nina Hubinet earlier this week said she had been barred from entering Egypt after arriving in Cairo for a holiday five years after she last reported from there. In February, Egypt arrested and deported British journalist Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times. “The inequality of growth is stark and the situation of most Egyptians is still quite dire,” said Michael Hanna, an analyst with the New York thinktank The Century Foundation.Adham Youssef contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614ef8bb0e0e09c10e48fa6ae4558fa50c0546c5/137_0_2727_1637/master/2727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c91c89118e444f80074bca3e7dfd470f","title":"juncker eu italy olive branch","story":"Jean-Claude Juncker has thrown the new government in Rome an olive branch, warning that Brussels and “German-speaking countries” must not repeat the error made during the Greek crisis by reading stern lectures to the Italian people.The president of the European commission said that, while he had been tempted to intervene during the recent political impasse in Italy, he was determined not to feed the populist narrative: that the EU is meddling in domestic affairs.Juncker noted that the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the rightwing League party had both recently dropped their policy of exit from the European Union, and he would judge them on their deeds and not their rhetoric.Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italian prime minister on Friday after a last-ditch coalition deal between the two parties ended months of political deadlock and narrowly averted the need for a snap election in the eurozone’s third-largest economy.Conte attended a military parade on his first full day in office, while his deputy Matteo Salvini, head of the League and an ally of French rightwing leader Marine Le Pen, was heading to Sicily as part of his campaign against illegal immigration.In an interview with German news service RedaktionsNetzwerk, Juncker admitted to “concern” about the recent developments in Italy, but insisted that the recent turmoil in the financial markets in response to the new government had been “irrational” and should not be seen as a guide to how the political story will unfold in Rome.“I think very highly of President Mattarella, but I have not spoken to him during this crisis. I have not interfered, although I have been tempted to,” Juncker said. “I do not want to feed the accusations spread by the populists that we are sitting in Brussels meddling in Italy’s affairs. I am certain the Italians have a keen sense of what is good for their country. They will sort it out.”But he went on: “By keeping out of it, I’m not helping. By getting involved, I’m not helping. I am caught between a rock and a hard place.”The commission president had flirted with danger on Thursday by suggesting that the EU should not be blamed for the state of Italy’s poorer regions, where there needed to be “more work” and “less corruption”. Rather than blaming the EU, there needed to be more “seriousness” within the country about tackling its economic and social problems, he said.In this latest interview, Juncker claimed that he had personally fought against those who wanted to launch an excessive debt procedure against Italy over the state of its finances, a process that would be designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome.Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, has a public debt second only to Greece’s and there was a negative reaction from the financial markets to the League-M5S coalition, which plans to significantly raise public spending.Juncker offered a more placatory tone, suggesting that Brussels and Berlin had learned the lessons of the Greek crisis. He also denied that the eurozone was set on a course for another economic downturn: “The Italians cannot really complain about austerity measures from Brussels. However, I do not now want to lecture Rome. We must treat Italy with respect. Too many lectures were given to Greece in the past, in particular from German-speaking countries. This dealt a blow to the dignity of the Greek people. The same thing must not be allowed to happen to Italy.” Juncker said that the financial markets’ reaction was “irrational”: “People should not draw political conclusions from every fluctuation in the stock market. Investors have been wrong on so many occasions.”Neither of the coalition parties in the new Italian government campaigned on leaving the euro or the EU, but both have backed such calls in the past and are scathing about the rules that underpin the eurozone.Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission and UK Treasury official who now works for consultancy the Eurasia Group, warned that as the cornerstone of the coalition government’s platform was fiscal expansion, it was liable to clash with the commission this autumn.“A significant deviation from EU-mandated fiscal targets may prompt the commission to open a new Excessive Deficit Procedure, a process designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome. Yet the symbolism of this move would only strengthen the Italian government’s domestic standing.”The size of the Italian economy means that a bailout in line with that given to Greece – should the financial markets turn on the Italian government – would be a huge and crippling endeavour for the EU. Rumours have emerged in Brussels that Berlin is looking at a plan B which would instead involve seeking to contain the spill over of future economic turmoil in Italy.Daniel Gros, a German economist, and director of the Centre for European Policy Studies think-tank, said: “The view is that it would be impossible to do a standard European Stability Mechanism programme for Italy because you would exhaust the entire capacity of the ESM. And Italy is not like Greece: it has a strong economy, it has a current account surplus and critically it has very little net foreign debt as a country. It would make no sense. Yet an ESM might be needed, if things get rough, to help Spain and Portugal.He added: “This is not an economic problem where economic measures are needed but just some crazy politics for which one does not understand the rationale... There is very little Brussels can do. I think they are still hoping that somehow they can bring Italy to reason, but I think that is a forlorn hope”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b3990c73370614aa406088b853adc8ae7512a56/0_31_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b558fa7e6776aefaaef5f636bd7a6e46","title":"lysette anthony welcomes start of harvey weinstein trial","story":"‘It’s all we ever wanted,’ says Hollyoaks star, before calling for women to stand togetherLysette Anthony welcomed the beginning of legal proceedings against Harvey Weinstein as she sported a #MeToo slogan on her wrist at the British Soap Awards.The Hollyoaks star is one of dozens of women who have made allegations against the movie mogul and said he needed be tried. She has said that she told the politan police she was attacked by him in her London home in the late 1980s. Speaking before the awards, Anthony welcomed the start of court proceedings against the producer in the US as she called for women to stand together. She told the Press Association: “Time is up – what I’m happy about is that it stops being trial by Twitter and justice gets due course. It’s what it’s all about, it’s all any of us, we’ve ever wanted. I’m telling the truth, but he needs the chance to be tried.” Anthony said dozens of other accusers had stories similar to hers. She compared the Time’s Up and Me Too movements to the Arab spring, adding: “I don’t mean to be disrespectful, because people died with the Arab spring, but that’s the purpose of Twitter – it is lone voices in the wilderness being heard, and that’s the most important thing.”Coronation Street star Nicola Thorp and Doctors actor Elisabeth Dermot Walsh supported Time’s Up on the awards red carpet, with the latter wearing a pin on her dress. Thorp said: “I’m so proud that actresses, not just in the UK but over the pond, have really been highlighting the issue with sexual harassment, not just in entertainment but in all lines of work. Weinstein has been indicted on rape and criminal sex act charges in New York. The film producer was charged in May on two counts of rape and one of a criminal sexual act for alleged incidents involving two women. He has repeatedly denied allegations of non-consensual sex and intends to plead not guilty to the charges."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3505689.1527087516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in praise of aphid eating pollinators","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA hoverfly at tomato flowers: drawing by Michael  VineyFor me, summer will be confirmed when I am stopped in my tracks by a glint in the air a step or two ahead of me: a spark of pure sunlight with just a hint of colour, a tiny whirr of wings that makes a space shift sideways, or up or down in a sudden, quantum bilocation.The insect is showing off, staking out a territory and hoping for a mate, and if I can track it to a flower, the hint of colour will no doubt resolve into the imitative, wasp-bright, yellow and black markings of so many of Ireland’s hoverflies.Stingless, most no bigger than a thumbnail, hoverflies are a largely unsung legion among our insect pollinators. Evolution has woven them into the ersity of wildflowers, and the past 5,000 years have recruited their Irish range of species, some 180 strong.While the pollinating services of bumblebees and honeybees deserve their headlines, gardeners value hoverflies for another great benefit. Their larvae, hatched on plants, eat sap-sucking aphid pests rapaciously: they are “aphidophagous”.Outstanding in this respect is the common and much-studied Episyrphus balteatus, whose glowing orange body bands make it “the marmalade fly”. Laying perhaps 4,500 eggs in its lifetime in the heart of aphid colonies, it is the aphids’ most effective natural enemy, to be welcomed into cereal crops and tomato and strawberry tunnels. Welcomed, that is, by growers who prefer aphid control by hoverflies than the toxic protection of pesticides.Last year, as the termination of neonicotinoids was finally played out in Europe, shocking news of major insect decline was reported in Germany. A 27-year record of insect biomass in 63 nature protection areas showed a midsummer decline in flying insects of 82 per cent – a drop inexplicable in terms of habitat or weather.This is part of the wider decline in flying insects that leaves our car windscreens and headlights unnaturally clean at journey’s end. It threatens to worsen as climate change disrupts the insects’ habitats and range. But more immediate threats are posed by the intensive farmland they fly across on long-distance migration.The marmalade fly, for example, while native to Ireland for thousands of years, is also a determined migrant. Like some of our butterflies, it travels in huge numbers from the Mediterranean, arriving in July and August and spreading across the island.The first scientific record of this came in 1995, when two biologists in a boat off Courtmacsherry Bay in Co Cork saw skeins of hoverflies heading for the coast in company with clouds of red admirals. The flies were so numerous that dead ones were forming drift lines on the sea. Such mass arrivals have sometimes caused public panic, as on coasts of southeast England during a heatwave in 2004. Mistaking the hoverflies for wasps as the insects settled on them for a rest, children ran screaming, prams were covered up, and so on.As for their return to the south, a memorable observation came from a British ornithologist, David Lack. Climbing to a high, narrow pass in the Pyrenees to check the passage of migrating birds, he found a torrent of hoverflies, chiefly Episyrphus balteatus, pressing on at ankle height into the wind. What caught his eye was “a shimmer of iridescent light, due to the reflection of the autumn sun on myriad tiny wings”. Given the dire decline reported from Germany, I have to wonder how far hoverfly migrations through Europe to Britain and Ireland have already been hit by neonicotinoids. The marmalade is among the hoverflies attracted especially to the nectar of yellow flowers, like the sulphurous shades of fields of oilseed rape, prime candidate for systemic pesticides. Such threats crop up in the scientific bible of Europe’s hoverflies, Syrph-the-net, the remarkable database compiled and maintained by Dr Martin Speight, long the leading entomologist of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and now with Trinity College Dublin’s zoology department.For example, accompanying the marmalade fly among the “anthropophilic” (human-friendly) species is another migrant, Eristalis arbustorum (no English name), common in urban parks and gardens. But its appetite for the nectar of hedgerow plants takes it on to farmland, where its larvae mature in cow dung.Like other insects involved in recycling manure, its progressive decline has been blamed on dosing cattle with systemic chemicals, such as ivermectin, to kill parasitic worms.There are few common names among hoverflies and a great variety in size, shape and colouring: several dark ones look more like bees. There is much more about them at the Irish Pollinator Initiative hosted on the website of the National Bioersity Data Centre (bioersityireland.ie).This also offers species photographs, gives access to their accounts in Syrph-the-Net and welcomes new records of local hoverfly species. These may begin with that memorable pause, a few mesmerising moments, watching a hovering hoverfly doing its quantum thing."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Labour leader says British parliament does not support government\u0026rsquos stance on the issueMan in his 30s is arrested following discovery of cannabis herb, cannabis resin and cocaineGarda\u0026iacute detain two men and recover a revolver during operation in Dublin 3Republic\u0026rsquos activists will back LGBTI rights and abortion reform in the North, event toldFirm\u0026rsquos payment system is back at \u0026lsquofull capacity\u0026rsquo after IT failure led to chaos across EuropeGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after man\u0026rsquos death following row at pub on Friday nightOregon Maple tree was planted in the 1840s, a sister tree in the square is being examinedDr Diarmuid Martin criticises the Church\u0026rsquos role in institutional care in IrelandCrowd gathers outside Nike\u0026rsquos flagship store in London to get hands on bright green kitThe 90s dance hit is an effective aid while carrying out CPR, researchers claimMajority of 5,000 customers that lost power overnight had their service restored by 2pmPensioner convicted of putting bomb on bus during Queen\u0026rsquos visit wants his appeal in IrishGarda\u0026iacute and HSE investigate how adult material featured on DVD for childrenGarda\u0026iacute recover MDMA and cannabis after searching man in Leixlip on Friday night\u0026lsquoInspiring and funny\u0026rsquo: Tributes paid to 15-year-olds Jack Kenneally, Shay MoloneyPew study shows 95 per cent of teens \u0026lsquonow say they have access to a smartphone\u0026rsquoThree fire brigade units dispatched to scene of blaze at home in SouthillYour questions answered about the debit and credit card problem that affected millionsBank Holiday weather: Met \u0026Eacuteireann predicts scattered thunderstorms and spot flooding\u0026lsquoI screamed and roared at his disappearance, and a nun slapped me right across the face\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516825.1527891655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government gives theresa may two weeks to solve border issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney: ‘If there is no progress on the backstop, we are in for an uncertain summer.’ Photograph: Cyril Byrne British prime minister Theresa May has two weeks to table written proposals on how to solve the Irish Border issue in order to avoid a Brexit crisis at a crucial EU summit later this month, the Government has said.Tánaiste Simon Coveney says the European Union taskforce, led by Michel Barnier, must receive detailed proposals in writing from the British government within a fortnight.This would allow time to debate and discuss the proposals ahead of the European Council meeting on June 28th and 29th. The Government has said substantial progress on the Border, including the so-called “backstop”, must be made by this summit.“In the next two weeks, we need to see written proposals,” Mr Coveney told The . “It needs to happen two weeks from the summit.”Mr Coveney’s warning reflects increasing exasperation in Dublin and Brussels that no firm proposals have emerged from London, with just weeks until the summit.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Coveney and other senior Ministers such as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe have repeatedly told their UK counterparts that such proposals are needed soon.“There’s a new idea or solution being mooted every week,” said a senior Government source, adding that Dublin was only “interested in proposals that are written down”.“On paper like. Or on a screen. We are at legal text stage. We need legal texts to draft and debate.”A leaked proposal on Friday from UK Brexit secretary David Davis – that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a “buffer zone” to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland – was dismissed by Government figures.The latest proposals were also dismissed by the Democratic Unionist Party which urged its Conservative partners in the UK government to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.On the buffer zone, one Government source in Dublin said it only moved a potential physical border, rather than ensuring that no physical border would be in place after Brexit.The UK and EU are due to agree a withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop, by October, but the Government has warned this will be thrown into doubt unless substantial progress is made this month.The backstop – which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border – was agreed in principle in December, although the UK has rejected the EU’s legal interpretation of it.“If there is no progress on the backstop, we are in for an uncertain summer,” Mr Coveney said. “At this point we need written proposals on the Irish backstop consistent with what was agreed.

File photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosLabour Party leader Brendan Howlin has said the Brexit position of Britain’s government amounted to “a very British coup”.Mr Howlin said he believed the British government does not have the support of its parliament for its Brexit strategy.He also called for prime minister Theresa May to demonstrate her mandate for her position on the issue.“It is entirely unclear that the positions being pursued by the British government have the support from the British parliament. What evidence we have suggests not. It appears too that the British government thinks so too. Having been defeated 15 times in the House of Lords the British government is yet to bring the EU Withdrawal Bill to the House of Commons ,” Mr Howlin said.Mr Howlin, who is also Labour spokesman on foreign affairs and Northern Ireland, made the remarks in a statement issued on Saturday.His comments come amid ongoing ridicule of a proposal from Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis to create a 16km buffer zone around the Border following Brexit. Mr Davis’s latest plan would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for Border checkpoints with the Republic. The proposals were roundly dismissed by Irish Government figures, members of the British parliament and the DUP, which urged the Tories to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on how to deal with the Border question. Pro-EU MPs have accused the British government of “making it up as they go along” when it comes to the issue.“The May government is refusing to advance its own Trade and Customs Bill in the House of Commons . . . because it fears defeat at the hands of Conservative rebels and Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats,” Mr Howlin said.“Meanwhile, the EU is obliged to engage with a British government whose extreme Brexit position draws no mandate either from the people in the referendum or Westminster.“If Ms May has a mandate for her position, let her prove it.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Photograph: REUTERSBEN NELMSFinance leaders of the closest US allies vented anger over the Trump administration’s metal import tariffs on Saturday and ended a three-day meeting with a stern rebuke of Washington ahead of a G7 summit next week in Quebec.In a rare show of ision among the normally harmonious club of wealthy nations, the six other G7 member countries issued a statement asking US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to convey their “unanimous concern and disappointment” about the tariffs to President Donald Trump.The 25 per cent steel and 10 per cent aluminum tariffs were imposed this week on Mexico, Canada and the European Union after temporary exemptions expired.“We’re concerned that these actions are actually not conducive to helping our economy, they actually are destructive, and that is consistently held across the six countries that expressed their point of view to Secretary Mnuchin,” Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau said at a news conference after the meeting ended in the Canadian mountain resort town of Whistler, British Columbia.The statement, written by Canada, also called for “decisive action” to resolve the tariff dispute at a G7 leaders’ summit starting on Friday in Charlevoix, Quebec.French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the United States has only a few days to avoid sparking a trade war with its allies and it was up to Washington to make a move to de-escalate the tensions.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Le Maire said the EU was poised to take counter-measures against the new US tariffs.Japanese finance minister Taro Aso said that direct discussions between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mr Trump may help resolve the issue, though Japan has refused to accept import quotas.“I’ve been to these meetings for a long time. But this is a very rare case where opposition against the United States was unanimous,” Mr Aso told reporters.Speaking separately after the meeting, frequently referred to as the “G6 plus one,” Mr Mnuchin told reporters that he was not part of the six-country consensus on trade and said Mr Trump was focused on “rebalancing our trade relationships.”Mr Mnuchin rejected comments from some G7 officials that the United States was circumventing international trade rules with the tariffs or ceding leadership of a global economic and trading system it largely built after the second World War.“I don’t think in any way the US is abandoning its leadership in the global economy, quite the contrary. I think that we’ve had a massive effort on tax reform in the United States which has had a incredible impact on the US economy,” Mr Mnuchin said.The US Treasury chief said he has already relayed some of the G7 comments to Mr Trump and added the president would address trade issues with other G7 leaders, but declined to speculate on any outcomes.Just before the G7 meeting ended, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that “the United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!”All six of the other G7 countries - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - are now paying the metals tariffs, which are largely aimed at curbing excess production in China.Canada and Mexico, which are embroiled in talks with the United States to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, responded to the move by announcing levies of their own on a variety of US exports.The EU is set to retaliate with tariffs on a range of U.S. goods, from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to jeans and bourbon. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3516834.1527886340!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup dismisses uk government s half cooked ideas on border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP MP Sammy Wilson said  none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. File image: Leon NealAFPGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has urged the British Conservative Party to stop coming up with “half-cooked ideas” on dealing with the Border and to provide clarity on its Brexit plan.Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis was reported on Thursday to be creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the Border that would be in effect for local traders, such as dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, The Sun newspaper reported.A 10-mile wide “special economic zone” would be created along the 310-mile border, within which local traders could operate under the Republic’s trade rules.The DUP, which props up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government at Westminster, has made clear that it does not want Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK.The party’s East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson said on Friday that none of the mooted proposals had been discussed with his party. He described them as “at best contradictory”.He said: “First of all, to suggest that Northern Ireland be tied to both EU and UK regulations, when one of the objectives of leaving the single market is to allow the UK to set its own regulations, raises the question which regulations apply to Northern Ireland if and when the UK and the EU regulations erge?“Secondly, who will make the judgement as to which regulations should apply? Will it be the EU or the UK Government? Will it be the UK courts or the European Court of Justice?”Mr Wilson said the purpose of the border buffer zone “appears to be even less clear”. He asked what would happen to trade from outside the buffer zone when it crossed into the zone and if checks would have to be carried out there.Mr Wilson said the British Government must make it clear that all of the borders that would exist as a consequence of Britain leaving the EU “whether that is between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, the Irish Republic and Great Britain, or Great Britain and Europe all present the same problems”.He concluded: “Instead of moving from one set of half-cooked ideas to the other it is now time for the Government to put down its foot and make it clear to EU negotiators that the Prime Minister stands by her commitment that no deal is better than a bad deal and if they want to avoid the consequences then they need to stop dismissing the perfectly feasible ideas that were put forward in August of last year.”Sinn Féin accused Mr Davis of trying to “hide a hard border in a buffer zone”.MEP Martina Anderson said: “Once again this shows the lack of knowledge of border areas and the concerns they face - David Davis obviously didn’t learn much on his flying visits.”Mr Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU did not deny that the proposal was under consideration.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has been absolutely clear that we cannot and will not accept a customs border down the Irish Sea, and that we will preserve the integrity of the UK’s common market.” - Additional reporting PANegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland

But Alex Hardiman, the company\u0027s head of news products, said in a blog post that users were shifting to consuming news on their phones and through video.So we\u0027re exploring new ways to help people stay informed about timely, breaking news that matters to them, while making sure the news they see on Facebook is from trustworthy and quality sources, she said.The trending section had been a headache for the company. It amassed notoriety in 2016 after a report that detailed allegations of the trending team suppressing conservative news. The backlash from conservatives led Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to extend an olive branch, holding a meeting at his company headquarters with more than two dozen conservative figures including Glenn Beck, Dana Perino and Tucker Carlson. Facebook eventually fired the editors on the trending team, replacing them with an automated process.But the curation of trending news in the absence of human oversight led to more embarrassment. The algorithms promoted 911 conspiracy theories, a false story about then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly, and a parody news article about magical iPhone features, which some say were early indicators of Facebook\u0027s misinformation problem. The company continued to modify the section, but Facebook said that over time it became less useful to users.Media analysts have argued that Facebook\u0027s reaction to claims of anti-conservative bias led the company to take a more lax approach to the Russian disinformation campaign. Facebook continues to face criticism from right-leaning circles. In recent months, Facebook has launched several initiatives to address accusations of political bias, misinformation and transparency in political advertising.The company has also been reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Lawmakers in Congress and in Europe have raised the possibility of drafting new regulations to address Facebook\u0027s privacy violations.In Friday\u0027s announcement, Facebook also said that 80 publishers are testing a breaking news label that they can pin to their articles in the news feed. The company is simultaneously experimenting with a breaking-news notification, a section dedicated to breaking local news, and a video feature for American users to watch live coverage and weekly reports.Ms Hardiman said Facebook will remove the trending section next week.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And a decision will have to be made as to whether we accept it or not.”It adds: “It cannot be right that 650 MPs alone decide whether to accept the deal, without any say for Londoners or people across the country. That’s why we think it’s essential that there is a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, so that 65 million people can have their voices heard as well.”The letter sets out the need to stop Brexit from damaging London’s status as “a cultural capital, a sporting powerhouse” and “a hub for international business, civil society and media”.While it accepts that the 2016 referendum gave the government a mandate to negotiate a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, it says ministers do not have a mandate to “force a bad Brexit deal on our city.”It argues that London, “represents all the most positive elements of being global, outward-looking, welcoming and tolerant. These values form part of the fabric of London. A bad Brexit deal risks tearing that fabric apart.”Up to now Mr Corbyn has doggedly resisted the idea of a public vote on the final deal, saying that the country should “respect” the result of the referendum in June 2016.Ten of the MPs went further\u0026nbspand backed a call for an option in any referendum to be remaining in the EU on current terms.Labour HQ declined to comment on Friday, but the Labour membership, which twice backed Mr Corbyn to lead the party, is believed to be largely against Brexit.While the exact geographical breakdown of Labour’s membership is not public data, insiders say numbers are heavily weighted towards London and other urban centres.Mr Corbyn and the most senior members of his shadow cabinet, like John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, Emily Thornberry, Barry Gardiner and Sir Keir Starmer all hold seats in the capital, which overwhelmingly backed Remain in the referendum.It comes after 12 Welsh Labour MPs, including shadow ministerial aides Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi, both defied the party line to sign a similar letter.Five MPs from Labour’s heartlands in the Northeast also signed a letter published by The Independent in May calling for backing the People’s Vote campaign, as did four\u0026nbspMerseyside\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand the city’s mayor.Last month Janet Daby\u0026nbspdefeated rivals supported by the Corbyn-backing Momentum group and Unite to become Labour’s parliamentary candidate for the Lewisham East byelection next month, having stood on a ticket of fighting to keep the UK in the single market.Anti-Brexit left-wingers announced they will\u0026nbsptour\u0026nbspBritain this summer in a campaign to build opposition to leaving the EU – calling on Mr Corbyn to back Remain and negotiate a “new settlement” with Brussels.The internal struggle in the party could come to a head when the Commons votes on whether to keep the UK in the single market in coming weeks, with Mr Corbyn currently refusing to back the plan.Labour’s current position is that that Britain’s EU membership must end and that the country should leave the\u0026nbspsingle market\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcustoms union\u0026nbspto negotiate new relationships to replace them.But the House of Lords, including more than 80 Labour peers who rebelled against Mr Corbyn’s will, passed an amendment to Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Bill that would see the UK remain inside the single market if it also now gets approved by the Commons.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

frontbenchers are urging\u0026nbspministers to reinstate the Access to Elected Office Fund without delayThe government has been accused of shutting disabled people out of elected office by delaying the return of a dedicated fund to help people stand for parliament.A group of Labour frontbenchers has urged ministers to reinstate the Access to Elected Office Fund without delay, which was set up under the coalition government to give grants of up to £40,000 to disabled candidates for additional costs such as transport or sign language interpreters.The vital fund was frozen for review in 2015, and Penny Mordaunt, the women and equalities minister quietly announced a further 12-month consultation earlier this month.Candidates will be able to draw from a £250,000 fund for upcoming local elections but critics warned this must not be used to kick the issue of a long-term solution into the long grass.Parliament only has five openly disabled MPs, including Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who is partially sighted, and Tory education committee chair Robert Halfon, who has cerebral palsy.In a letter to Ms Mordaunt, co-signed by Ms Cordova, shadow voter engagement minister Cat Smith and shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler, Labour said: “It is vital that the government finds a long-term solution to improve the substantial underrepresentation of disabled people in public life.“This 12 month public consultation period cannot be used as a way to defer government responsibility and kick this into the long grass.“Whilst all political parties can do more to reduce barriers facing disabled candidates, the extra campaign costs they incur as a result of their disability should be met by the government and not by political parties.“The Access to Elected Office fund must be fully restored without further delay.”Ms Smith told The Independent that delaying the decision added to “a catalogue of policies that have failed disabled people” by the government.She added: “Disabled people are shockingly underrepresented in public life and without additional financial support many talented candidates are prevented from standing for public office.“If the Tories are serious about delivering a fair and equal society, they will restore the fund as a matter of urgency.”David Buxton, who was the first deaf sign language-using parliamentary candidate in 1997, said the cost of paying for interpreters had dissuaded him standing for the Liberal Democrats in the upcoming Lewisham East by-election.Mr Buxton, who co-founded Liberal Democrats Disability programme, said: “I know the area well, having lived and worked there for years.“The hindrance was that I was unable to find enough funds to pay for BSLEnglish interpreters during the by election campaign, so I decided not to send the application an hour before the closing date.”He urged the government to reinstate the fund to allow him a final chance to stand for the next election, after 30 years of working in politics.He went on: “To date, parliament has only 5 disabled MPs in spite of the fact that Britain has nearly 20 per cent of people having a disability.“In other words, parliament could have 125 disabled MPs.“parliament should be seen as positive, strongly erse and well represented across all communities, fully embracing ersity, equality and inclusion”.Ms Mordaunt said the disabled population in parliament was “not sufficiently represented” but placed the burden on political parties to bring about change.Announcing the consultation in a statement earlier this month, she said: “The prime responsibility for this would sit with political parties themselves.“However, within this, there will be ways the government can help too, for example by looking at extending the support we already provide in other areas such as employment to enable other activities such as volunteering or representing their communities.”She added: “While this work is ongoing we want to ensure that disabled people can run for office, so we are announcing a fund of up to £250,000 to support disabled candidates, primarily for the forthcoming English local elections in 2019.“We will set out further details about the scheme in the near future and any measures taken to ensure such costs are not considered to be part of a candidate’s election expenses.”A\u0026nbspGovernment Equalities Office spokesperson said: “The first announcement the new Minister for Women and Equalities made was for £250,000 to support disabled candidates for elections held over the next 12 months.“This is so disabled candidates are not disadvantaged while the situation is improved.“We are not consulting for 12 months, but instead will work with disabled people’s organisations and political parties to ensure every disabled person who wishes to run for office can.“There is a role for government but the prime responsibility and financial burden lies with political parties themselves. They must properly support disabled candidates, and we will help them do that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In England, the net earnings threshold will be £7,400 whereas in Northern Ireland it will be £14,000.A government technical note published in May said that if the change had not been made, “around half of all (state school) children would become eligible for FSM and the meals would no longer be targeted at those who need them the most”.It said that in 2017 around 1.1 million disadvantaged children were eligible and received a free school meal, some 14 per cent\u0026nbspof all state-school pupils.But if the change had not been made the number of additional children who would have been eligible was between 2,300,000 and 2,600,000 by 2022.In a speech to the GMB’s Public Services Conference in Brighton on Sunday, Mrs Rayner will urge the Government to adopt Labour’s plan for free school meals for all primary school children.She will say: “Ministers said time and time again that no one would lose a meal, only for the IFS to reveal that one in eight children who were eligible will be stripped of their entitlement under the Universal Credit.“Now it appears that there would be millions more who could have had a meal but will be denied.“Even now, the\u0026nbspgovernment refuses to release their own calculations in full.“Their claims on school funding have collapsed and now their story on school meals is falling apart.”The technical note was published on the Government’s website after a Freedom of Information request for it by the GMB, the union said.Ministers have said it was never their intention for the temporary arrangements to remain in place and that an estimated 50,000 more children will receive free school meals by 2022, compared with the old benefits system.It comes after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned in April that it expected there to be “losers” under changes introduced via UC, which sees six benefits rolled into one payment, despite 50,000 more children becoming eligible.GMB general secretary Tim Roache said the policy was “cruel, heartless and needless”.He said: “I can’t believe there’s even a debate about whether kids should go hungry or not.“In blunt and stark terms, this policy is taking food from the mouths of millions of children from poorer backgrounds.“Our members working in schools already encounter children with no food at home, they see packed lunches of no more than crisps or chocolate and buy snacks for their pupils out of their own pockets because too many parents are struggling to make ends meet.”Children and families minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “It’s right that we continue to support the most disadvantaged children.“Contrary to misleading statements, every child who currently receives a free school meal will continue to do so and as we have repeatedly made clear our data – which is publicly available – clearly shows that around 50,000 more children will benefit from free school meals by 2022.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Organisers say Tibet’s involvement has been met with considerable oppositionWhen the Fifa World Cup kicks off less than two weeks from now, the top prize at stake is not really going to be the token £29m handed to the winner, but an unquantifiable sense of national pride.And although it may feel a million miles away from Russia’s 81,000-capacity Luzhniki Stadium, pride is also the most important factor at the rival World Football Cup which began this weekend across a number of little-known non-league grounds orbiting London.Sixteen “members” are taking part in the 10-day tournament run by Conifa, the Confederation of Independent Football Associations, offering a platform for oppressed regions and unrecognised breakaway states that, for one reason or another, have been rejected for membership by Fifa itself. The question is, can their pride be classified as “national”?Conifa has\u0026nbspbeen running the World Football Cup roughly once every two years since 2013, but this year’s tournament is comfortably the biggest.Thursday’s opening match day also boasted some high-profile names – former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg officiated the first game, former Major League Soccer star James Riley captained a team from the North American “bioregion” Cascadia and there’s a team representing the Ndebele people of\u0026nbspZimbabwe that is coached by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.Yet the real stars of the show, and the ones who have proved most controversial, are a team from Tibet. Dispatched to the earthly confines of Enfield and Sutton with a blessing from the Dalai Lama himself, they have been ordered by His Holiness to conduct themselves with “compassion” and “uphold the honour and dignity of the Tibetan people”.That won’t mean pulling out of any 50-50 tackles, the team’s manager Passang Dorjee tells The Independent. But it does bring with it a sense of responsibility to provide “an example for the whole world to see” of what Tibet can achieve when it stands on its own.The Tibet team were\u0026nbsphanded a wildcard to appear at this year’s competition by the organisers, and face an uphill struggle to get out of Group B. They were beaten 3-0 on Thursday\u0026nbspat Enfield Town’s Queen Elizabeth II Stadium by the reigning 2016 champions Abkhazia, a Russia-backed disputed territory in northwestern Georgia. Two more challenges await over the course of the weekend in the form of Northern Cyprus – the Turkish part of the island – and Karpatalya, a Hungarian-speaking enclave of central Europe.But they are the definition of the plucky and popular underdog, boasting an impressive number of supporters and leading out the opening ceremony procession.None of them actually live in the Chinese-administered region that they are in London to represent – Dorjee explains that “because of the political situation, there was no hope at all that Tibetans could come out of Tibet to play in this kind of thing”. The Chinese, he says, are “very strict about who goes in and who comes out”, and those who did play would never be allowed to go back home.Their players come instead from the Tibetan diaspora, most from the mountainous regions of India, Nepal and Bhutan but also some from North America, Europe and two from the UK.While a good number attended the blessing by the Dalai Lama at\u0026nbsphis home in India, the first time the full squad met up and trained together was in London, a week before their first match in the cup.Just having Tibet at the World Football Cup is enough to ruffle feathers, the organisers say. Paul Watson, Conifa’s director, says they had several international brands lined up to provide sponsorship into the six figures until, one by one and,\u0026nbsphe suggests, at China’s behest,\u0026nbspthey asked for Tibet to be kicked out. Only Paddy Power, the bookmaker not alien to controversy itself, remained as the main sponsor.It made financing the competition “really difficult”, Watson told Sky Sports. “People are scared to sponsor an event like this because they’re afraid of offending China.”But, the team’s manager Dorjee stresses,\u0026nbspthe Tibetan football team was not calling for the region to have full independence from China, but rather to be granted more autonomy and have its people’s rights observed.Tibet are not the only participants to come up against opposition. The organisers claim the (Greek) Cypriot government wrote to every council hosting matches – even those where Northern Cyprus were not scheduled to play – telling them they should withdraw from the tournament.But for the players, even at this most unusual and geopolitically charged event, the sport rises above politics.Tenzin Nyendak is one of the two British members of the Tibet squad. The 30-year-old centre-half moved to the UK nine years ago from Bylakuppe, a town in southern India with a Tibetan diaspora second only to Dharamsala – where the Dalai Lama lives.He has never actually played for a league club in London, but as one of the stars of London Tibetan Football Club has travelled across Europe to compete against other teams of Tibetans in exile.Nyendak tells The Independent it is “a privilege to be part of the national team squad… I am really proud to represent Tibet globally.”He says that football is the closest thing Tibetans have to a national sport, and he believes the team will be backed “by all Tibetans, in and outside Tibet”. Unable to travel from London, he was disappointed to miss out on the pre-tournament audience with the Dalai Lama – who has said in the past that he enjoys watching football when he can.Yet in spite of all that, Nyendak would not be drawn on what his manager referred to as the “political situation”. “We take it as a sporting event, we don’t want to involve football with politics,” he says.“We came here to play. Playing football and winning the tournament are the only objectives we have.”Tibet’s chances of proceeding to the knockout stages of the cup, let alone winning it, will depend much on their result against Northern Cyprus, again in Enfield, on Saturday evening.Either way, it won’t matter too much to their manager, Dorjee.“We are just proud to get this golden opportunity to represent Tibet at Conifa,” he says. “When we hear our national anthem, and we can see our national flags flying in the ground, it makes us realise we have already achieved a lot.“Winning and losing is not important. The important thing is to say that we are here, we Tibetans can also play football, and to show that we have equality.”Tibet lost 3-1 to Northern Cyprus in Saturday\u0027s matchor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper said Mr Soder said afterwards that the Vatican’s attitude was supportive.“Söder did not talk to Francis about the so-called crucifixion, which came into force this Friday in Bavaria. However, subsequently the State Secretariat had expressed a ‘fundamental benevolence’ towards initiatives of a ‘Christian confession to the outside’ as well as the Bavarian care and family allowance,” the Frankfurter Allgemeine reported.The Secretariat of State is responsible for general church affairs.Bavaria is Germany’s second-most populous state, and three in four citizens are Christians. It has one of the highest densities of Catholics in Europe – half of all its people, while 19 per cent are Protestant and 4 per cent are Muslim.Authorities say the new law is about culture, not religion. The decree reads: A clearly visible cross must be placed in the entrance area of every service building to serve as a reminder of the historical and cultural influence of Bavaria.A poll across Germany showed just 29 per cent of citizens supported the move but in Bavaria, more than half did so – 56 per cent. Among supporters of Mr Soder\u0027s political opponents, the Alternativ fur Deutschland, more than three-quarters\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp77 per cent – approved.However, several art colleges have rebelled, saying their campuses were erse institutions, leading authorities to reportedly backtrack on the obligation for museums, theatres and universities, and saying now that a crucifix is only recommended.A lack of specific instructions about sizes and placement means the crosses could be very small, so long as they are visible in the foyer.Since chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the influx of migrants into Germany in 2015 and 2016, the role of Islam in German society has been much debated.Mr Söder and his party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have been accused of using populist strategies to garner support ahead of state elections in October. The party’s absolute majority is under threat, with conservative voters shifting support to the right-wing AfD following the refugee crisis of 2015-2016.The Kreuzpflicht - or cross duty - is seen as Mr Söder’s answer to the arrival of the mostly Muslim refugees.\u0026nbspBut Cardinal Reinhard Marx, archbishop of Munich and president of the German Bishops\u0027 Conference, accused the premier of using it to foment ision, unrest and animosity. Thomas Sternberg, President of the Central Committee of German Catholics, said the crucifix should not be used for election purposes.\u0026nbspIn February, Bavaria banned full-face Islamic veils in schools, universities, polling stations and government offices.Earlier this week Denmark banned the wearing of face veils in public, after the government argued veils were contrary to Danish values.\u0026nbspor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It\u0027s easily the biggest wildlife petition ever in Scotland and for several days last week it was the most popular petition on the world\u0027s biggest petition website. We are going to let it roll until we get to at least a quarter of a million signatures and then say to the Scottish Government there is unprecedented public support for this campaign so what are you going to do about it?The group\u0027s petition was launched on the change.org website just three weeks ago and has already gathered more than 166,000 signatures.It calls on Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham to immediately halt the logging and exploitation of Clashindarroch Forest to ensure the iconic Scottish Wildcat survives.NCThere are plans to log up to 60 per cent of Clashindarroch Forest Supporters from all over the UK and many from around the world have signed up to the campaign, with thousands of comments left on the website.Tracey Wiffen, from Gosport, in Hampshire, said: It is absolutely vital that this habitat for the Scottish Wildcat is preserved and no longer disturbed. Sometimes, most of the time, life is more valuable than profit if you have the commonsense to see it.And David Mackay, from Inverness, added: The Scottish Wildcat is one of the last truly wild animals of note left in Scotland. It would be a travesty to lose it for the sake of a few tonnes of timber.Ian Adams, from Liverpool, said: Forest plantations are clearly a commercial undertaking but the loss of such a rare animal would be nothing less than a disaster. The Scottish Government must call a halt to this logging operation, even if compensation has to be paid. Does Nicola Sturgeon want to be the saviour or the assassin?A spokesman for FES said Clashindarroch was managed sustainably, leaving a mosaic of habitats including mature trees and replanted areas that was shown to be very beneficial for Scottish Wildcats.He added: It is heartening to know that so many members of the public have such a keen interest in wildcat conservation. The protection and conservation of the Scottish Wildcat is something we feel strongly about too.FES undertakes a huge range of actions to conserve wildcats and also other important species such as red squirrels, capercaillie and birds of prey \u0026ndash they all benefit from our conservation management.Clashindarroch is a working forest and is very important in terms of supplying materials to the timber industry in Scotland.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Barnier is a mutual acquaintance.”A source added: “Barnier met Best for Britain supporters in recent months.”But former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: “This tells you all you need to know about the Best for Britain campaign.“It is nothing to do with Britain, but instead focused on people outside of Britain for the benefit of people outside of Britain.”The Brexiteer added: “It is classically anti-Brexit and it is time for citizens of nowhere and everywhere to stop interfering with British politics.“Stay out of it, and stop trying to overturn the democratic will of the British people.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the emergency services themselves can be very nervous. It’s a very daunting time. But without fail, our emergency services step up. It was no different during the London Bridge attack. The policemen who answered - within minutes - the first call had no idea what they were going into. It’s times like that you really do see the best of our services. We must never take for granted the sacrifices they make.  Each time there is a terror attack or a tragedy like Grenfell, we see our emergency services doing us proud. You see off-duty medics, police, firefighters coming in to help their teams. And that’s to save as many lives as possible. I worked with Dr Martin Griffiths when I was at the Royal London and he’s a great example of this. Martin was off duty when the London Bridge call came in. He made his way there as soon as he heard the news. It’s so important that people like Martin are recognised for their work.

And stats show his calamitous 2,099-day reign has seen soaring waiting times, cancelled ops, bed shortages and a 100,000 staff shortfall. Writing exclusively for the Sunday Mirror, Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders today asks: “How has this master of incompetence kept his job? “Perhaps Theresa May is so weak she cannot afford any more ex-ministers on the backbenches. We are used to Tory ministers taking no responsibility for their shortcomings.”  Mr Hunt was appointed on September 4 2012. Since then the number of people waiting more than four hours in A\u0026ampE is up 842 per cent. Then 9,022 people waited more than four hours – in March it was 76,054. An extra 1.4 million people are on NHS waiting lists compared to 2012. And the number of people waiting over two weeks for urgent cancer treatment has more than doubled from 53,738 in 2013 to 113,373 in 2018.  There are 7,000 fewer beds available in NHS hospitals now than in 2012 And bed occupancy at the end of last year was the highest recorded. Stats also show the waiting time measure for consultant-led treatment is at 22 weeks, and has been above the 18-week target since early 2016. Mr Madders said: “Nearly six years of Jeremy Hunt has taken the NHS to a place we haven’t seen since the last Tory Government nearly finished it.” Labour\u0027s view  By Justin Madders   Shadow Health Minister  Our NHS nears its 70th birthday in crisis – yet Jeremy Hunt today becomes its longest-serving Health Secretary ever. How has this master of incompetence kept his job for five years and 273 days of failure? Of successive unprecedented winter crises? Of an extra 1.4m people on the waiting lists? Of an 842 per cent rise in people waiting over four hours in A\u0026ampE? Or a staff shortfall of 100,000? Perhaps Theresa May is so weak she cannot afford any more ex-ministers on the backbenches. We are used to Tory ministers taking no responsibility for their shortcomings. From education, to transport, to law and order, they wreak havoc and misery without consequence on hardworking people. But it’s in health where failure is most pronounced.

I was walking along Skegness beach with my parents when I came across a really interesting-looking rock with a footprint on it. We took it to a local museum for identification and it turned out to be a 120-million-year-old Cretaceous bird track – that period was 145.5 million to 66 million years ago.  I’ve been hooked ever since all I ever wanted to be was a palaeontologist and discover a real dinosaur. And although it took a while – 23 years – I did. When I was younger my parents used to take me fossil hunting whenever they could. We visited the Isle of Wight, where I found some Iguanodon bones and other bits and pieces, and that’s when my collection started to grow. I quickly became known for my hobby, even my local newspaper wrote about me when I was 12.  By that time I had around 9 million fossils and bones of all shapes and sizes, which I’d either found, bought, or traded. I kept them all at home in sheds, in my bedroom and around the house – I was just one of those kids who was dinosaur mad. It was a teacher who suggested I share my interest with others, so I started my own magazine. I got some copies sold in a local shop and used the proceeds to buy more fossils. After that I set up an educational website with forums where people could chat and get their items identified too. I was 17 when I made my first major find at some brick pits, where a friend and I would often go fossil hunting. It was very rare to find bones there, but on this particular day, I did. I started running towards him screaming at the top of my voice, ‘I’ve found a bone!’  But in my excitement I forgot to look for more, by which time I’d run about 30m away from where I’d picked it up. It took me ages to find that spot again.  Thankfully, I did, as I’d uncovered a Plesiosaur skeleton – a large marine reptile that lived during the early Jurassic period (200-145 million years ago). This one was complete apart from its head. I couldn’t believe it. It was my first proper find and I got to help excavate it. It was amazing, as I learnt so much about the processes involved.  A couple of years later I found another skeleton, which turned out to be a new species – that’s one of the best parts of my job, making new scientific discoveries.  After college, where I studied archaeology, I put on a small display as a tourist attraction near my home, but my collection quickly outgrew the room. Over the next few years I moved venue several times as my mini museum grew and attracted more visitors.  When my grandfather passed away he left me a legacy, urging me to ‘use this gift to follow your dreams’. Thanks to his support and belief I was able to open Fossils Galore in 2012 – my very own museum, shop and educational activity centre, so I could share my passion with others every day. I made my biggest discovery one day back in 2017. I was walking along the side of a quarry in Surrey on the hunt for anything interesting, with Sarah Moore, who I met after she came to volunteer at Fossils Galore. She found a block of compacted clay that had a few little black bones in it. We started looking for more and that’s when we noticed a bulldozer had pushed it up the slope. We followed its tracks down and I found another larger piece. ‘My God! Look at this. It’s bone after bone after bone!’ I said, as we split the block open with a hammer and a chisel. It was a real ‘wow’ moment. We’d found a dinosaur. And not just any dinosaur, a 132-million-year-old Iguanodon – the biggest dinosaur discovery made in the UK since 1989. We knew exactly what we had when we found some of the vertebrae and thumbs. We nicknamed him Indie. It took us five weeks to remove all the bones, which were encased in large blocks of the mineral siderite, and transport them back to our lab in Cambridgeshire on a lorry for excavation. I’m really hopeful it’s going to be a new species with a big story to tell, and we can’t wait to get Indie on display so everyone can meet him. But that’s a long way off. Iguanodons were herbivores, capable of walking on two and four legs. They weighed about 3 tonnes and were famed for their thumb spikes, which were probably used for defence and foraging. We think this particular specimen was around 3 metres tall and 6 metres long, and because of its size it’s going to take five years to fully excavate it. It’s time-consuming, as we have to use air scribes to slowly etch away the layers of rock to reveal each individual bone, then our finds have to be recorded. I’ve got a great team of volunteers, but we’re always looking for more and, because the museum is a not-for-profit organisation, we are trying to raise \u0026pound50,000 to keep the project going.

Stretching lazily, Miss Kisses, Kitten’s pink dog, yawned. On Kitten’s pink bedside table, her pink phone sat beside her pink lamp. Sunshine was peeking through the pink curtains and as Kitten gazed across her pink room, she was in heaven.  Kitten’s pink pursuit began almost by accident 34 years ago. It was her 20th birthday and she was trying to work out what to wear to her party. She settled on a pink top, pink fluffy skirt, pink shoes and pink accessories.  I felt fabulous. I thought, if wearing that much pink could make me feel fantastic, why not wear pink every day? Going back to blue jeans and a white T-shirt seemed ludicrous to me. I didn’t want to wait until the next special occasion to feel pink-credible again. I wanted to feel and look pretty in pink every day. I sold my car so I had enough money to leave my hometown of Houston, Texas, and head for the bright pink lights of Hollywood, says Kitten.   I like to say I’m a flamingo in a world full of pigeons. When I walk down a busy street during the morning commute, everyone’s wearing grey and black. There’s no expression, no individuality. Yet people think I’m the crazy one! Over the years, Kitten estimates she has spent over one million pounds on pink paraphernalia and outfits.  That sounds like a lot, but if you break it down over the decades, it’s no more than anyone else is spending on cars, sofas and soft furnishings. The only difference is, for me every pound is spent on pink, she says.  From the moment you step over the threshold into her pink palace, everything is pink. Tickled pink From the front door to the TV to the loo roll, if it comes in pink you can bet your pink dollar I’ve got it. My hairbrush, my toothbrush, my kitchen utensils, you name it, it’s pink, enthuses Kitten.  My car is customised in pink, with pink chair covers and a pink gear stick. The number plate reads PINKEST, of course! Every item of clothing I own is a shade of pink. I have a pink whisk for when I bake pink cookies, a pink chair where I sit at my pink dressing table to apply my pink make-up. I have a pink throne and a pink crown bedazzled by pink jewels. I am the Queen of Pink, after all. I even use a safe, vet-approved, beetroot-based dye to colour my dog, Miss Kisses. I don’t have children but Miss Kisses is my baby, we go everywhere together. I have a recurring dream that I have a super power, where everything I touch turns pink, as if I’m magic, Kitten says.   It’s like the Midas touch but instead of everything turning gold like it does in the mythological story of the King of Phrygia, everything I touch turns a beautiful shade of my favourite colour. When I wake up, I can’t help smiling because I look around and think dreams do come true. Celebrities, including Paris Hilton and Carmen Electra, have flocked to Kitten’s home. But while most people find Kitten’s life entertaining, she is used to fending off criticism from those who think it’s all for show. Hollywood highlights  People think there must be days I’m feeling sad or just can’t be bothered to do the pink thing. They think sometimes I must just throw on a black tracksuit, but I say, \u0027Never!\u0027 It’s not for show, Kitten says.  Every day I wake up looking forward to the day. I couldn’t wake up in this pink world and feel anything but happy – it’s such a happy colour. It’s a privilege to run my hand over my rail of pink outfits and figure out what ensemble I’ll wear each day. I’m a fashionista and I make sure my outfit is well choreographed. Not every shade of pink complements every other shade of pink. My life is a carefully curated work of art.   Kitten has now made a name for herself as the Pink Lady of Hollywood. Every year, on America’s National Pink Day in June, Kitten is called upon as the world’s premier pink specialist.   When I pulled on that adorable pink outfit for my 20th birthday, I never could have imagined I could have a pink career but now, being pink is not only my passion, it’s put a pink roof over my head too, says Kitten. I earn money through my social media platforms. It still amazes me that a three-minute YouTube video can earn me money but that’s how the world works now. I’m an influencer – I didn’t even know that was a job but I’m just doing what I love and getting paid for it.  I also work as an actress and singer. My latest song, Queen Of Pink, has just been released. I’m a big fan of the Queen of England. She wears pink too. I would love the Queen of Pink to meet the Queen of England. We could swap fashion tips! Kitten’s Instagram page @kittenkaysera has over 70,000 followers and 52,000 people have subscribed to her YouTube channel. Videos chronicling Kitten’s pink life have been viewed millions of times – her fans are hooked on her every pink move.  Kitten even writes her emails in a pink font. She has several pink cases for her phone, pink sweets in jars on her pink kitchen surfaces, pink coats to go over pink tops. There are 30 pink sunglasses and lipstick in every shade of pink, to suit every pink mood she’s in.  There will always be haters. For some reason, people take offence when other people are too sure of themselves, too happy. I never let the trolls get to me. They’re just jealous that their life isn’t as colourful as mine, Kitten says.  I take their jibes with a pinch of pink salt. Seriously – even my salt is pink. It’s Himalayan rock salt, a beautiful, soft shade of pink. Kitten is single by choice but dates occasionally. Most men find her style fun but one gentleman came to Kitten’s house for dinner and didn’t comment on the extraordinary world he’d entered. After a while I had to ask him what he thought of all the pink and he looked at me blankly, before asking if I was wearing pink. He was colourblind! To him, my outfit and home seemed grey. He couldn’t appreciate it so I had to give him the pink slip, Kitten says. ‘I’m not looking for love and I wouldn’t want a man to wear pink for me but I can only ever imagine myself being with someone who sees the pink and loves me for it. A colourful life The evolution of Kitten’s taste has seen her go through soft pink and baby pink stages, but right now, she’s loving a neon vibe. The older I get, the hotter the shade of pink I am drawn to, Kitten says. I get sent pink gifts from fans all over the world and I can’t sell or give anything away. I rent a storage unit just to keep all my pink pieces. It used to be harder to find things in pink but these days there are 50 shades of pink for just about everything I could possibly need or want in life. I’m spoiled for choice.

The youngster, who got hooked after seeing adverts for betting websites at a football match, committed credit card fraud for a year. He blew \u0026pound60,000 in a week-long online betting binge which left his parents horrified. Today the lad – whose identity we are protecting – talks about his addiction as new Government figures reveal he is one of 25,000 children aged 11-16 who are hooked on gambling. The schoolboy started betting online after going with his \u0026shycompany director dad to Wembley, where he saw adverts for online bookies on screens and on boards around the pitch. He took pictures of his dad’s business credit cards on his smartphone and set up an \u0026shyaccount online under his parent’s identity. Within days he was hooked, getting a massive high from his wins – but placing bigger and bigger bets. He was staking as much as \u0026pound3,000 at a time and placing hundreds of bets a week. The boy, from Lancashire, said: “I had no idea that \u0026shygambling could be an addiction like smoking, drinking or drugs. It seemed like fun and I thought I would make money too. “It was just far too easy. I just had to put in dad’s name, \u0026shyaddress, date of birth and card details and checked a box saying I was 18 – it took literally seconds to register and start gambling.”  His spiralling losses were \u0026shydiscovered six months later when his father got a call from the bank questioning transactions and money missing from the account. By this time, the lad had \u0026shyalready accumulated losses in excess of \u0026pound20,000. Confronted by his parents, he instantly confessed. Following psychotherapy, his parents assumed their son had learned his lesson. But several months later he went on a week-long gambling binge \u0026shyusing the same card details, this time building up debts of a further \u0026pound60,000. Now the parents say they can \u0026shynever trust their son again as they are \u0026shycrippled by loans they were forced to take out to pay debts. Their son still only 15, said: “I am sorry for what I have done. I feel like I’ve ruined everything and our lives will never be the same again.” He spoke out with the agreement of his parents who want to warn other families about the dangers of online gambling – at any age. He said: “I remember being at Wembley seeing all those adverts, hearing guys around me bragging how much money they’d won and figured I’d give it a go. It seemed fun and easy. “I knew dad’s business was doing well and thought he’d be less likely to spot that than \u0026shymoney coming out of a personal account.” His father’s groundworks firm had a turnover of over \u0026pound30,000 a month and dozens of contractors so his betting went unnoticed at first.  He said: “I started off placing small \u0026pound5 or \u0026pound10 bets on football matches and horses, and had a few wins, which was a massive buzz. It felt like free money. I only regretted not placing bigger bets on my wins, ignoring my losses, and started going bigger and bigger. “I was placing \u0026pound100 bets, and then a few weeks later I was regularly betting \u0026pound1,000 a day. “By then I was down by several thousand pounds, and the only way I could think of \u0026shygetting it back was by more betting. “I was spending around six hours a day betting or researching bets. I missed football training, I skipped homework. Betting was the only thing I could think about.” When his father got the call from the bank and checked the statements, he and his wife knew straight away what was going on. The 43-year-old company \u0026shydirector said: “We were just so angry, not just at him, but also at ourselves for having been naive and trusting. “We had been so \u0026shypreoccupied with our own lives we hadn’t noticed his school grades going down.” The boy started weekly one-to-one sessions with psychotherapist Steve Pope along with weekly group sessions with other addicts. But five months later he had a relapse. He found his dad’s wallet with a credit card and went on a week-long \u0026pound60,000 gambling binge. He said: “It was like this monster in my head calling me to go back.”  A week later his dad had \u0026shyanother call from the bank saying the huge amount had gone. The father said: “I seriously thought our business and our house would be lost. “We had to make a couple of redundancies. We couldn’t even tell those employees the real reason why this had happened. We felt simply terrible.” The father says they will be paying back the loan for the foreseeable future. He said: “We are lucky that we didn’t lose everything. “Now other children might start stealing or securing loans to pay for their \u0026shygambling \u0026shyaddiction. “It’s as bad as \u0026shybeing a heroin addict – the lack of trust, the secrecy, the deceit, but without the obvious signs of drug addiction.” Politicians are calling for \u0026shybetting companies to face the same advertising regulations as tobacco firms in a bid to stem the epidemic of child gamblers. Earlier this week a cross-party group of MPs wrote an open letter to Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock insisting on a gambling ad ban during live sporting events and before the watershed. They claim that an increasing number of gambling adverts are now being aimed at children. The number of 16-year-olds hooked on gambling has risen by a third in the last three years, according to Government regulator the Gambling Commission. Telltale signs of a child addict How to spot signs your child is a problem gambler  Unexplained absences from school or classes Sudden drop in grades or failure to complete assignments on time Change of personality or behaviour Exaggerated display of money or other material possessions Unusual interest in newspapers/magazines/sports scores Borrowing or stealing money Withdrawing from family and friends Uncharacteristically forgetting appointments or dates  Therapist warns of epidemic The psychotherapist treating the schoolboy has warned that gambling is now causing more problems than street drugs among children. Steve Pope said: “These kids get hooked and once they feel the buzz they can’t stop. It’s a silent epidemic and we’re all walking blindly into this without a clue as to the real scale of the problem. “Gambling is just as damaging as cigarettes, or even more so because it’s openly advertised everywhere in such a fun, exciting way, but the long-term consequences are very, very real and disastrous.” Steve added: “I’ve been working in addiction recovery for over 30 years, and I’m staggered at how many gambling addicts under the age of 20 are coming through my doors.” "},{"url":null,"title":"disgraced solicitor who preyed sick","story":"NewsDisgraced solicitor who preyed on sick miners uses compensation cash to buy £2.8m mansion in WAG capital of UKAndrew Nulty snapped up a six-bedroom home with a pool, tennis court and sauna in an area favoured by multi-millionaire footballers and their wives\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan Selby20:34, 2 JUN 2018Updated21:35, 2 JUN 2018NewsThe home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, which was purchased by Andrew Nulty\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA disgraced solicitor who preyed on sick miners has used compensation cash he skimmed off to buy a \u0026pound2.8million mansion in \u0026shyBritain’s WAG capital. Andrew Nulty snapped up a six-bedroom home with a pool, tennis court and sauna in an area favoured by multi-millionaire footballers and their wives. Stars who have lived in posh Wilmslow, Cheshire, include Wayne Rooney, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. Mr Nulty, 49, was branded a “disgrace to the profession” and struck off for breaking rules to amass his fortune from mine workers’ compo claims. Last night miners said the house was an insult after thousands he targeted died from horrific diseases they caught after inhaling pit dust.  Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said: “It’s wrong Mr Nulty is still living the high life off his ill-gotten gains, especially seeing as most of his claims were for people who are probably no longer with us. “We still deal with a lot of people suffering with pneumoconiosis. It’s not a nice disease.” Mr Nulty took home \u0026pound13million in a single year by exploiting the Coal Health Compensation Scheme. His firm raised \u0026pound40million by processing at least 32,000 claims from pitmen and their families after the scheme. He advertised his services as free, but as well as a flat rate from the Government he took 15 per cent of some payouts in fees. This was paid back in 2005.  He committed no criminal offence but the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal struck him off for breaching Law Society rules on a number of charges – including failing to give adequate information to clients and taking a 15 per cent cut of any damages some received. At the time a spokesman said: “He preyed on sick men who were not used to dealing with the legal profession and shafted them. “It was a total dereliction of a solicitor’s obligations to his clients.” "},{"url":null,"title":"everyone knows who done it","story":"News\u0027Everyone knows who done it\u0027: Holidaymaker claims whole neighbourhood knows who vandalised car with \u0027No Parking\u0027 paintBenny Finkelstein\u0027s car was daubed with paint after he parked it in a residential street and flew off on holiday\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCharlotte CoxTim Wyatt20:59, 2 JUN 2018Updated22:53, 2 JUN 2018NewsTwo cars were vandalised with the words NO PARKING in paint when they were parked up on Lownorth Road in Wythenshawe.

The words \u0027No parkin\u0027 were slathered over Benny Finkelstein\u0027s red Hyundai in white paint last month. One of the car\u0027s tyres was also slashed. The 34-year-old had parked his car on a residential street in Wythenshawe around the corner from Manchester\u0027s airport before jetting off for an 18-day holiday in Israel. The Manchester resident said he was shocked to discover the damage on his return because he had used the area for free parking many times before.     The local police force tweeted an image of the cars and branded the incident completely unacceptable but Finkelstein said the police don\u0027t care about what had happened. I understand the frustration of citizens in this area but they can’t come and just do what they want to, he told the Manchester Evening News . “Does that mean I can go and start painting people’s houses in that area and have no penalty? “It feels like there are no rules in this neighbourhood. I’ve no doubt everyone who lives there knows who did this. But there is nothing being done by the police.”  He added: “All the cars have private driveways, nobody has the right to decide if I can park on the street or not It was parked legally, I’ve done it many times before.” Benny says he spoke to a resident who told him of their frustration over unofficial meet and greet firms using their streets to ‘dump’ cars. He added: “She knew who had done it, I think everyone in this neighbourhood does but they won’t tell.  “I’m pretty sure they are happy as it means they can get parking permits.” Benny says he paid \u0026pound100 for a car wash to remove the water-based paint but he’s yet to replace the tyre. The attack comes amid residents’ growing frustration over holidaymakers and airport staff parking their cars in communities around the hub.

The apparent theft bid went completely unnoticed at the time and only emerged when Declan Teasdale checked his footage.

Cops, their families and members of the public yesterday bombarded the firm\u0027s Facebook page with negative reviews in retaliation for an anti-police advertising campaign that accused officers of being paid to lie.   There was a huge backlash over the shocking posters that popped up in windows of Lush stores and appeared on the firm\u0027s website .  Lush argued it was simply shining a light on intrusive, abusive, political policing amid an ongoing public inquiry into undercover officers\u0027 secretive activities. But critics said the posters were a disgrace and an insult to hard-working, front-line officers. Police and their relatives got revenge by posting negative, one-star reviews on Lush\u0027s Facebook page, leaving the profile awash with scathing remarks. But some later claimed their reviews were deleted or their Facebook accounts suspended within hours of writing comments about Lush.  Lush however denies removing, blocking or deleting one-star reviews. One customer said: Last night I left a one-star review as a result of their recent campaign. I used to be a loyal customer, spent far too much of my hard-earned money in their stores. This morning, my Facebook account had been locked out following a report of suspicious activity. I had to change my password, verify comments I had made, and go through a lot of drama to get back into my account. My review of Lush UK has mysteriously disappeared.  Another asked: Are Lush just going to delete every one star review and negative feedback comment on Facebook, then block the person who leaves it, such as myself, my friends and police colleagues have been? One said: Dear Lush, why are you deleting and blocking anyone who has left you a 1 star review? Another accused Lush of falsely report(ing) peoples profiles as hacked so that you can delete their reviews and boost your ratings is disgraceful and totally unethical. A Lush spokesman said in response to criticism on Facebook: I can confirm that we are not removing or blocking any comments or deleting posts. This is not an anti-state/anti-police campaign. We are aware that the police forces of the UK are doing an increasingly difficult and dangerous job whilst having their funding slashed. We fully support them in having proper police numbers, correctly funded to fight crime, violence and to be there to serve the public at our times of need.  This campaign is not about the real police work done by those front line officers who support the public every day - it is about a controversial branch of political undercover policing that ran for many years before being exposed.  Our campaign is to highlight this small and secretive subset of undercover policing that undermines and threatens the very idea of democracy. There is an age old understanding that our government and public institutions are there to protect and preserve the rights and safety of the public.  In the case of these secretive undercover units, their work went well beyond the boundaries of acceptable police tactics and is now the subject of an ongoing public inquiry, which was instigated by Theresa May during her time as Home Secretary when the scale and scope of the breaches of protocols started to become clear.  This public inquiry needs help from the public to keep it on track and ensure that this one opportunity for full honesty and disclosure is not lost or squandered. All citizens should be concerned when human rights are abandoned by those in power. The police themselves have admitted in their public apology to seven of the females deceived into long-term relationships with police spies, that these actions were a violation of the women’s human rights, an abuse of police power and caused significant trauma”. In a recent court case the police admitted the actions amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment breaching Article 3 of the European Declaration of Human Rights. Those victims are now asking that the public inquiry demands that the undercover units release a full list of the undercover names used by their operatives, release a list of which campaign groups were targeted, and also that they release the information and data entries they hold on individuals whose lives and homes were infiltrated during these operations. Without this full disclosure there is no way of knowing the full extent of what happened during the dark years of this renegade secret policing operation - and that full disclosure might not happen unless the public demand it.

The mother of James Bulger has picked up the keys to a brand new holiday lodge, creating a legacy to her son which will be reflected in the smiles of hundreds of struggling kids. James Bulger House will serve as a place of sanctuary for victims of crime and families who are disadvantaged or have lost loved ones. James was a month away from his third birthday when he was taken from a shopping centre by two ten-year-old boys on February 12, 1993. He was tortured, abused and murdered. He would have been 28 this year. Paying tribute to wellwishers who helped raise \u0026pound200,000 to make her vision come true, Denise said: “My James would be so proud.” It is the culmination of a project that began with the launch of the James Bulger Memorial Trust in 2008. Since then, Denise and husband Stuart have been letting hundreds of families stay in their static caravan on a holiday site near Blackpool. It was a way of putting some happiness into other children’s lives – but also a way to say thank you for the outpouring of love and support Denise has had ever since James’s murder. And seeing the difference that small gesture made to so many, they were keen to turn it into something more.  Denise said: “The support from everyone has been incredible. “Our dream was to be able to raise the money to upgrade the holiday home to a stunning lodge – and I’m excited that, with the donations and fundraising, we’ve managed to fulfil this.” The lodge at Ribby Hall, in Lytham St Annes, Lancs, was also designed to be fully wheelchair accessible, allowing the Trust to extend its mission to families unable to use the caravan. Denise added: “I can’t thank everyone enough, it’s been a very emotional 12 months. Being handed the keys this week has filled me with pride and love.” TV presenter Sir Trevor McDonald has backed the family – and helped with their fundraising efforts at a star-studded black tie ball in March. He has also made an ITV documentary to mark the 25th anniversary of James’s killing. Sir Trevor said: “I’m over the moon that Denise and Stuart have managed to reach their target and obtain their dream lodge in James’s memory. “They do so much great work with the James Bulger Memorial Trust – it’s really special they do so much for other people.” James’s killers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were only ten years old when they became the country’s youngest murderers for 250 years. They took little James’s hand and led him away from a busy shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, while Denise was in a butcher’s shop. They walked him for two and half miles to a railway line, where they tortured, beat and sexually assaulted him. Venables and Thompson then lay him across railway tracks, hoping he would be hit by a train to make the murder look like an accident. His body was discovered two days later. In January this year, Denise released I Let Him Go, a book detailing her anguish since James was taken. Writing about the day of his murder, she said: “Getting my purse out to buy two pork chops for tea was the last thing I did before my world imploded for ever. I went into the butcher’s holding my little boy’s hand, making one final stop before heading home. “I left without James’s hand in mine. It was one of those moments where the world feels like it is turning in slow motion. I remember a voice in my head. ‘Not James. Not my beautiful boy.’ This couldn’t be happening to me, I didn’t ever let him out of my sight.”  In February Denise led calls for a public inquiry into James’s death, and the decision to release Venables and Thompson from prison. But despite a 200,000-strong petition it was rejected by justice chiefs, who ruled an inquiry was not necessary. Venables and Thompson were released after serving eight years in youth prisons. Both were given new identities to protect them from reprisals. Robert Thompson has not reoffended since and is believed to have settled down to a normal life with a long-term partner. But Jon Venables has faced a number of further court cases since his conviction, using up almost \u0026pound260,000 in legal aid. He has been repeatedly sent back to prison over child porn. His \u0026pound259,585 legal aid covered judicial reviews, bids for new identities and an appeal against his sentence. Denise, 50, was eight months pregnant with son Michael, now 24, during the 1993 trial of Venables and Thompson. She went on to have Thomas, 19, and Leon, 18, with her second husband, electrician Stuart Fergus, 42. She had divorced from James’s dad Ralph Bulger in 1995. But Denise says she spent years fearing her boys would be snatched.

A Sunday Mirror probe found “once-opened” instructions are inconsistent and unclear as to whether they are recommendations on food safety or quality. So consumers end up confused as to how long they have to use a product, potentially encouraging them to bin things which are still perfectly edible. Now experts are calling on supermarkets and manufacturers to come up with a standard labelling system to reduce waste. One consumer champion even questioned if retailers were confusing shoppers deliberately to make them spend more.  In one extreme example, Patak’s mango chutney tells consumers it will last for six months after opening. Yet a virtually identical jar of Sainsbury’s own brand advises it must be used within four weeks. Hellmann’s mayonnaise gives a shelf life of three months once opened but Asda’s version allows only four weeks. Sainsbury’s salad cream tells consumers it must be used within four weeks, whereas the Asda version allows for eight.  Morrisons’ own brand red pesto says it will last only a week but Sainsbury’s own version gives consumers 14 days. A pack of chicken breasts from Iceland can be used within 24 hours of opening. But a Tesco pack advises immediate use. A pack of beef mince from Morrisons states it must be frozen on day of purchase and used within a month. But the label on a Sainsbury’s pack says it can be frozen any time within the use-by date and has a freezer life of three months. Households throw away 10.2million tons of food worth \u0026pound15billion a year. Of this, five million tons are still edible, according to figures from the official advisory group the Waste and Resources Action Programme. Last week Tesco ditched best-before dates on 70 packed fruit and vegetable lines in a bid to cut waste. Consumer activist Helen Dewdney, from the site The Complaining Cow, said: “Of course people will throw things away when past these dates, which increases food waste. One has to question why supermarkets are doing this? Is it to actually encourage people to buy more?” The British Retail Consortium said: “Retailers and food businesses work with suppliers to ensure the quality and safety of their products. Use-by dates vary as products, recipes and supply chains vary.” KETCHUP: Fridge Dipping chips in cold ketchup may not be to your taste, but scientists say keeping it in the cupboard has health risks.

Forecasters say the hot weather will make a return after the lightning, thunder, torrential downpours and flash floods that have blighted recent days. The mercury is expected to rise throughout week before peaking in the middle of the month. Some meteorologists say the blazing weather could even last well into July. Temperatures as high as the mid 20s will be common place, with even 30 degrees possible on the hottest days. One expert warned it could be muggy and humid on occasional cloudy days, but this will largely give way to extreme heat.  James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Express : We expect it to turn increasingly warmer through the first week of the month with many parts of the country basking in temperatures in the mid 20Cs. “It could be rather muggy and humid with some variable cloud cover, but when the sun does come out it will feel extremely hot as summer gets underway.” WeatherAction forecaster Piers Corbyn added: From the second week of the month onwards when we expect to see a return to heatwave conditions, very hot weather is expected over Europe and some of that is going to influence the UK.  “We expect this to continue through to mid-month after which it will continue to be vary warm with another heatwave situation expected at some point. Yellow weather warnings for rain are currently in effect for large parts of Scotland, the East of England, North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber and the West Midlands.

A dash-cam video shows how the light aircraft suddenly loomed over cars going to and fro, before screeching to a halt in the centre of the street. The Cessna 172 had just taken off from the John Wayne airport in southern California when it made the emergency landing in Huntington Beach, just outside Los Angeles. The owner of the dash-cam had just turned left at some traffic lights when the plane appeared out of nowhere overheard.  The aircraft plunges towards the centre of the road, swinging scarily from side to side as other vehicles swerved to avoid a crash. Somehow the pilot managed to bring the Cessna to a halt just before another set of traffic lights at the end of the road. Amazingly, no-one was injured in the landing and no damage was caused. The car driver can be heard exclaiming on the dash-cam footage I almost just got hit by a plane...what the hell, this guy almost ran into me!  Bill Castelblanco was at work on the same road when the extraordinary events unfolded. We heard everybody screaming at the same time, so we ran out right when everybody else did, he told the Orange County Register.

Demi Sweeney, a 22-year-old criminology student at Bournemouth University, spotted a huge spider outside her room last week.  Demi told BuzzFeed that she woke up to an empty house at around 10am.  She said she felt trapped in her room as the spider might drop onto her if she passed by. As all of her housemates were away, she messaged friends and family for help. One suggested ordering food on Deliveroo and asking the delivery driver to sort the situation out.    Demi said she checked with Deliveroo first to see if drivers are allowed in customers\u0027 homes. They are. She decided to get KFC (and accidentally ordered two meals) and added a note on her order: I have spoken to Deliveroo customer service, please can you help to remove a spider for me. Twenty minutes later, her fried chicken arrived and Demi ran downstairs to her saviour. Unfortunately, the driver, who had seen her request, was also scared of spiders, so Demi had to beg.

In the footage parents film the disturbing end-of-term production on their phones. The children, none older than five, wear camouflage army uniforms, cover their faces in balaclavas and carry imitation assault rifles. In the video they can be seen storming a cardboard house with mock explosives, \u0027shooting\u0027 dead an Israeli soldier - played by another pre-schooler - and then carrying out a \u0027hostage\u0027 dressed as an Orthodox Jew over their shoulders. The boys \u0027attack\u0027 is tightly-choreographed, suggesting they have spent several hours practising their parts in the macabre play.  Throughout the video tense music is played and there is a fusillade of mock gunfire and even smoke bombs set off. The performance ends with the youngsters placing a sign which reads, in Arabic and Hebrew, Israel has fallen on the back of the supposedly dead Israeli soldier. A speech by the dead former leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yasser Arafat, is then played while other kids point pistols at the crowd.  The disturbing scenes came at the graduation ceremony of the Al-Hoda nursery in Gaza, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) which popularised the video, also available on YouTube. MEMRI - which publishes English translations of videos, speeches and other material from the Middle East - describes itself as bridging the language gap between the Middle East and the West but was founded by a former Israeli military intelligence officer and has been accused of selectively translating only the output of extremists to pursue a pro-Israel conservative agenda. The scary show put on the nursery is not the first time it has produced a \u0027young jihadi\u0027 performance. In 2016 children at the nursery pretended to plant anti-tank mines, kidnap and kill Israeli soldiers, and launch mortars.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man struggled with his partner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKriss McCann, 36, of Farington Terrace, had sentence deferred by Sheriff Derek Reekie after he pleaded guilty to struggling with his partner.McCann admitted that he behaved in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause fear or alarm, shouted and swore and acted in an aggressive manner towards his partner Zoe Henry, and struggled with her at Marryat Terrace on January 24.Sentence was deferred until August 29 for McCann to be of good behaviour.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities multiple openings for office managers and admin staff","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMultiple companies around Angus and Fife have advertised openings for office managers and admin staff.Allied Surveyors Scotland plc is looking to fill a permanent position for an experienced secretary.\u0026#8220We are a busy firm of Residential Chartered Surveyors that are located in St Andrews,\u0026#8221 it said.\u0026#8220Any applicant must be experienced and capable of audio typing and preferably we are looking for applicants who have previously worked with Quest, a workable understanding of Word and Excel would also be an asset.Administrative Assistant is required for a busy estimating and surveying department.Applicants should be proficient in the use of excel and word and have a good telephone manner.And a Warranty/Workshop administrator is required for a busy agricultural machinery dealer.Previous experience in this area of work is preferred but training will be given.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities your chance to be an apprentice engineer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn opportunity is available for an apprentice engineer.You’ll train as a technician and learn how to maintain a variety of groundcare machines.The exact nature of your work will depend on your skills and development.Full training will be given.For more information, including how to apply, visit the Jobs in Scotland page.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0e842560e98.jpg ","title":"dundee people new book documents history of scottish football grounds including dens park and tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former Evening  journalist celebrated the launch of his new book documenting the history of Scottish football grounds.Author Steve Finan greeted customers at Waterstones on Commercial Street where he signed copies of his new book Lifted Over The Turnstiles.The book features almost 200 never-before-seen black and white photos of 42 senior league football stadiums from the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including Dens Park and Tannadice.Steve, now editor of DC Thomson Heritage, said: “It was great to see such a large and lively crowd at the launch.”To order the book call 0800 318 846 or visit dcthomsonshop.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d78c487b44.jpg ","title":"dundee people spirited dundee beautician has business nailed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThis award winning beautician has absolutely nailed her claw creations \u0026#8211 even battling cancer and still coming out on top.Jennifer Valentine, 31, has now opened her own salon on Blackness Road after scooping industry awards.Most recently she was named Best Nail Artist of 2017 at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards in October 2017.And now she has been nominated as Nail Technician of the Year at the Scottish Beauty Industry awards which will be announced on June 17.It all started nine years ago when Jennifer undertook a nail technician diploma in Glasgow.Jennifer said: “Beauty was something I was always into and after completing my diploma I did nails part time.“About five years ago I started my own business at home then started renting spaces in salons.”In 2016 Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer but still carried on creating her nail masterpieces from her home when she felt well enough.Thankfully in June 2017 Jennifer was given the all clear and was determined to get back into the beauty industry.“My friend used to have her salon in premises in Blackness Road and when she outgrew the space she told me to take over the lease,” she said.“I decided to go for it and I opened the salon a few weeks ago with an amazing team behind me.“Having been unwell for such a long time I wanted to get back into work and it gave me the push to just go for it.“My current team are Brooke Garside, Helena Turner, Victoria Davie and Nicky McLeish.“They are all amazing.“It has been difficult but it looks amazing now and we are offering a wide range of beauty treatments.“I have worked my way up from working in my house to now owning my salon and I could never dream of doing anything else.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b111dfa0d8de.jpg ","title":"playpark becomes first in dundee to go smoke free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA playpark in Stobswell has become the designated first smoke-free play area in the city.New signs designed by Glebelands Primary School pupil Weronika Soltys have been unveiled at the playground in Baxter Park.The signs will now be placed across parks throughout the city, restricting smokers from lighting up in play areas.Anne Rendall, neighbourhood services depute convener, said: “By introducing smoke-free playparks in Dundee, we are able to create children’s play areas that are cleaner as there is less chance of cigarette ends being discarded.“I believe these voluntary smoke-free zones will help improve people’s health across the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

It will also look at the introduction of some of its funniest and most famous characters – Dennis and Gnasher, Rodger the Dodger, Minnie the Minx and, of course, The Bash Street Kids.Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: “The exhibition is amazingly detailed.“It means that real hardcore fans of the Beano and Bash Street Kids are likely to come more than once.“To me, it’s like reading the Beano – you read it the first time then go back and see a wee joke here or there that you maybe missed.“Those wee nuggets will be picked up the more detailed your visit to The McManus is.“The exhibition includes things from the archive that haven’t been seen for years, from the very first issues of the comic right up to the CGI from the Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed series from CBBC – so it’s really unique.”The Bash Street Kids, Beanotown’s most rowdy pupils, have featured in the publication since the 1950s.Mike said: “The Bash Street Kids strip started out life as ‘When the Bell Rings’ in 1954, and that was because the editor at the time encouraged staff to look out the window when the bell was rung at the High School of Dundee for inspiration for the zany antics of the children in the playground.“What the kids were doing ended up in the strip quite regularly and helped the design of the characters.“In 1956 they became the Bash Street Kids and began to focus on the group of kids in Class 2B that we still see today.“Since 1961, David Sutherland has drawn the strip.

He’s one of the few artists who still hand in a hard copy of their work – a true legend.“You can imagine how much of his work is included in the exhibition. We will be showing a special movie in which he stars, showing the strip being put together.“I think The McManus is the only place in the world suitable for this because the cartoons are really Dundonian in nature.“Many a time there has been someone walking up Reform Street who has been the inspiration for a character or scene in the Beano, so The McManus really is the only place to showcase this.“For 80 years the Beano has been regularly enjoyed by 27 million people in the UK, so there will be things that appeal to grand-parents and grandchildren, their own memories of the comic over the years as it has evolved.”Meanwhile, illustrator Nigel Parkinson has created an original comic strip starring The Bash Street Kids designing the new sign for The McMenace.The illustration shows them tangled in the “Waldella, Dundee” by artist David Batchelor, which is one of museum’s most popular exhibits.The exhibition runs until Sunday October 21 and entry is free of charge.For further information, visit beano.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past gallery of the week  Glasgow theatres","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"25 years of Real Love  The Time Frequency founder Jon Campbell reveals the key to the band s success","story":"                          IT\u0026rsquoS the early 90s and East End songwriter Jon Campbell is sitting in his Dennistoun flat compiling the words to Real Love."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7151092.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Radical council plan to give residents control over budget spending","story":"                          Communities in Glasgow will get control of \u0026pound1m of council cash in a pilot scheme to give people more control over decisions."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7866672.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Can you help  Scotland  39 s top dance school needs a new home","story":"                          SCOTLAND\u0027S dance school is desperately seeking a new home with the closure of the Citizen\u0027s Theatre."},{"url":null,"title":"The bare chest is back  Aidan Turner shirtless again in new Poldark","story":"                          AIDAN Turner will cause a stir among viewers when he returns for another series of Poldark \u0026ndash without his shirt on."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7867829.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Cruel conmen convince Dennistoun woman  90  to hand over   600 for DIY work -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential. With the future of the British High Street in decline at the moment, we need to look at as many options to make it viable for all business and attract new brands into the city centre.\"Sunday 3 Jun 2018 8:41 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

Russell clipped in the cross from the right and McBurnie\u0026#8217s powerful header from 10 yards bounced back off the right post.However, four minutes later the Scots were lucky not to be further behind. A counter-attack from a Scottish corner ended with Vela being free in the area.But rather than shoot Vela cut the ball back for Layun, but his effort from close range was blocked by a combination of Bain and Shinnie.On 65 minutes Scotland had another let off when Dylan McGeouch\u0026#8217s poor pass allowed Lozano in and after skipping away from Mulgrew he rattled the crossbar from 10 yards and then sub Marco Fabian blazed the follow up over.With 18 minutes left the ball was in the visitors\u0026#8217 net when sub Oribe Peralta knocked in the rebound after Lozano\u0026#8217s header was saved by Bain, but Peralta was flagged offside.Scotland tried their best to force an equaliser but another clear-cut chance wasn\u0026#8217t forthcoming and Mexico were threatening on the break.In the 90th minute sub Jesus Corona got clear and lobbed the ball beyond the advancing Bain but Mulgrew headed off the line.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos Santos 57), Hirving Lozano (Jesus Corona 73), Carlos Vela (Javier Aquino 63), Raul Jiminez (Oribe Peralta 57).Subs not used: Alfredo Talavera, Javier Hernandez, Erick Gutierrez, Jesus Molina.Scotland: Jon McLaughlin (Scott Bain 46), Stephen O\u0026#8217Donnell, Jack Hendry, Scott McKenna, Graeme Shinnie Johnny Russell, Dylan McGeouch, Kenny McLean (Chris Cadden 55), Callum Paterson (Charlie Mulgrew 55), Ryan Christie (John McGinn 55), Oliver McBurnie (Lewis Morgan 80).Subs not used: Jordan Archer, Jamie Murphy.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

Why not come along and do the five mile Wee Wander on Sunday and take part in Kiltwalk?“I’m sure participants will come back next year and raise even more money for the causes people care about.“We will have around 2,200 walkers and we reckon they will raise £250,000 and it will be my privilege to add £100,000 for charities here in the north-east.”The philanthropist, who made his billions in property and sports goods, explained that it was the participants who make the charity walk so special.He said: “I always ask people taking part who they are walking for and why and their stories really inspire me.“It’s incredibly moving to hear why they’re doing Kiltwalk. And what I’ve discovered is that every single walker has their own story and they are all compelling and sometimes heartbreaking – it shows Scotland has heart.”Walkers will be taking on three different distances, the 5-mile Wee Wander, 14-mile Big Stroll or the Mighty Stride which involves a marathon-length distance of 26 miles.The new route of the Wee Wander will now see participants set off from Camphill Rudolph Steiner School in Bieldside, following the River Dee before ending up at the Kiltwalk Village at Duthie Park.Those hardy walkers taking on the Mighty Stride will begin their journey at Potarch Green, while Big Strollers will begin at Milton Park in Crathes.On finishing, participants will be able to enjoy entertainment in the Kiltwalk Village from the Aberdeen Jazz Orchestra, as well as a hot meal.There will also be the chance for one lucky fundraiser to win a new Vauxhall Corsa 1.4 SRi, donated by Arnold Clark.It’s not too late to register to take part in this year’s Kiltwalk.The Mighty Stride suits the energetic and active, covering a marathon 26 miles starting from Potarch at 9am.Those hoping for something a touch less strenuous can take on The Big Stroll which sets off at 11am with registration from 10am.Entry for adults and children is £31.65.The Wee Wander route is much more achievable at just under five miles.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here.

Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries.

Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie.

The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.

Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party.

But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it.

He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached.

had never been a World Cup staged in eastern Europe.\nBut it was not just England\u0026rsquos regret at missing out that prompted questions to be asked over Russia\u0026rsquos staging of world football\u0026rsquos most famous tournament and the pinnacle of the beautiful game.\nA corruption scandal eventually engulfed Fifa in the summer of 2015 as US investigators arrested six officials in a racketeering probe, while\u0026nbspSwiss authorities raided Fifa headquarters, gathering data and documents for a separate investigation into allegations of criminal mismanagement and money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.\nThe old guard, including Mr Blatter, were replaced by a new leadership that promised to clean up the game\u0026rsquos image and enshrined in policy a commitment to protecting human rights.\nCommentators continue to raise the spectre of racism and homophobia in Russian football, concerns that campaigners say remain even on the

had also been the scene of clashes between England and Tunisia fans during the 1998 World Cup, has cast a long shadow.\nMr Putin at first dismissed the fighting, saying: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know how 200 Russian fans could fight several thousand of the British.\nBut experts said there have since been attempts to curb hooliganism by Russian authorities in time for the World Cup, including security services forcing the leaders of firms to sign agreements that they will not organise or participate in fighting.\nSome, including several MPs, fear those issues could be exacerbated by the deep freeze in relations between the Kremlin and the West\u0026nbspsince early March, and the poisoning of Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.\nA row over a
