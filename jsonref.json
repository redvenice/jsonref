They quizzed 30,000 in the research.And a British Medical Journal study based on 26,000 participants published last month found less than half of respondents (42 per cent) stayed home for the full ten-day quarantine period.Experts have suggested many are not self-isolating because of insufficient income support and concerns over struggles with mental health.They add many housing options - such as small flats in city centres - make the requirement impractical.Ministers cut the self-isolation period from two weeks to 10 days in December, amid warnings the period was too long and many people were not following the order.Medical officers said there was sufficient evidence that people weren\u0027t infectious after this time period. "},{"url":null,"title":"Sainsburys urgently recalls 4 50 Medjool dates","story":"Share this article\u0027If you\u0027ve purchased them, do not eat them.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 325,243 had received their second dose.Some 192,095 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 347,313 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 478,879 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp76,331 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 800 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 9 000 people sign up for vaccination on hse portal within first hour","story":"Leo Varadkar: People who refuse AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine will go to  back of the queue for inoculationMore than 9,000 people signed up to receive Covid-19 vaccinations within the first hour of the HSE allowing 69 year-olds to register online for the service from 10am on Thursday.Around 9,000 people used the HSE’s online portal (vaccine3.hse.ie) while a further 500 used the telephone registration service (1850 24 1850). Those intending to register online are required to provide their PPS number, Eircode, email address and mobile phone number with anyone unable to do so, advised to register by phone.Earlier, the Tánaiste Mr Varadkar said the State is on track to ease restrictions as planned from May 4th and that he expects more than 80 per cent of people to have received their first vaccine dose by the end of June. People who refuse the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, he said however, would have to wait until the end for a vaccine. The Government’s chances of meeting its target had been undermined this week by the announcement that Johnson and Johnson was pausing the distribution of its vaccine. Ireland had been due to receive 604,800 doses of it by the end of June.On Wednesday, however, it was revealed that the EU is to receive an additional 50 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine with Ireland’s share amounting to 545,000 doses. The extra supply would make up most of the previous shortfall and so puts the Government back in a position to broadly stand over its earlier projections.In the hours after the news regarding the Pfizer supply was received, the Irish Medical Organisation, which represents GPs, informed its members that the schedule for administering vaccinations to people classified as “highly vulnerable,” or “vulnerable” had been recalibrated. It said that Pfizer will be used in General Practice for vulnerable people aged 18 to 59. Deliveries of vaccines for those considered “highly vulnerable” will be spread across three weeks, commencing on April 26th. Second doses for these people and first doses for those considered “vulnerable” will begin to be administered on May 17th with second doses for for the “vulnerable” starting to be rolled out on June 14th .GPs were told that the vaccinations booked on the portal will commence next week. It is thought those for the over 60s will be done using AstraZeneca and the Tánaiste’s comments suggest that anyone in that group unwilling to receive this vaccine would face a significant wait to be offered an alternative.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Mr Varadkar said: “We are on track, the kids are back to school, the 5km rule is gone, we’re building houses again – we are on track both to ease restrictions as planned from May 4th and to have over 80 per cent of people receiving their first vaccine by the end of June.”Mr Varadkar said the estimate regarding the vaccination rollout programme timeframe was “as solid as it can be” even if it has been changed 25 times, but it was necessary to be agile and respond as changes occurred.He also said the possibility of extending the length of time between first and second doses was being examined but it was not going to happen to those who already had their first dose. However, it could be an option for younger people later.Mr Varadkar added that at the end of April the Government would sit down and develop the plan for May. “What we’re planning is to allow more outdoor activities, a phased reopening of retail and personal services.” When asked if this would include hairdressers, he said yes, but not on May 4th. “That’s unlikely, but over the course of the month of May there will be a phased reopening of personal services.”When asked if he was being overly optimistic, the Tánaiste replied: “I’m forever being accused of optimism, but in a country full of pessimists and despondency it’s nice to have someone who thinks the other way, maybe.”There were four things that would determine the pace of the reopening, he added these were availability of vaccines, the variants, case numbers and “the state of hospitals.” Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney told the Today with Claire Byrne show that the safest thing by far is to say yes to the offer of a vaccine. Mr Coveney said it was clear that the AstraZeneca vaccine provides “benefits that far outweigh the risks”. He called on people to “trust the system” that he said has been decided upon based on risk. “The message needs to be very clear. AstraZeneca is safe. And it’s particularly safe for people over the age of 60, in the context of the threats they face from Covid. People should trust the system because the decisions are being made by public health experts, not by politicians, when it comes to who gets what, and when.” Mr Coveney said people who refuse to take the first vaccine that is offered to them “then you’re essentially putting yourself to the back of the queue until everybody else gets vaccinated which will certainly take quite some time.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"overturned lorry on m50 sparks widespread traffic disruption","story":"M50 staff work to get a lorry that overturned on the M50 northbound  back on its wheels.

The terms of reference focus on “decisions taken around the development and use of supply chain finance (and associated schemes) in government, especially the role of Lex Greensill and Greensill Capital”.

I don’t blame them. The everyday inclusion training promotes a number of poisonous political ideas, though these are disguised by anodyne management-speak.One of the worst ideas is that of unconscious or implicit bias. This is the myth that you can use psychological tests, usually done over the internet, to determine whether someone is unconsciously racist (or sexist, or indeed any other -ist or -phobe of your manager’s choosing). Do you hold secret racist thoughts? Computer says yes. In truth, these tests are about as scientific as a horoscope. Last year, the Government abandoned implicit-bias testing in the Civil Service. It found that there is currently no evidence that this training changes behaviour in the long term or improves workplace equality. The Harvard Business Review similarly found that even any beneficial effects may not last after the programme ends.There are major downsides, too. In a world where being a racist is (understandably) one of the worst offences possible, many employees are terrified of scoring poorly on these tests. It also enjoins everyone to put race at the forefront of their minds at all times. What might once have been normal, casual interactions between colleagues can become a minefield. Everyone is expected to second guess if their behaviour is, implicitly, giving off racist signals. The end result is that ethnic-minority employees are treated differently – hardly a win for equality.But despite the lack of clear benefits and the demonstrable downsides, the reach of unconscious-bias training and testing is always expanding. A  survey found that 81 per cent of UK companies subject their employees to it – despite many business leaders losing confidence in it. But few are prepared to air their concerns out loud. The former boss of KPMG was forced from his role after he called unconscious bias complete and utter crap. After every single unconscious-bias training that has ever been done, nothing’s ever improved, he observed.The protective ring of silence around all things ersity allows this kind of training and thinking to creep into more and more areas unchallenged.Another questionable idea found in the National Trust’s training is that of equity. It might sound a lot like its close cousin equality, but don’t be fooled. The training uses an illustration of three people standing on different sized boxes so that they all end up being the same height. Everyone requires different types of support. We must recognise this in order to be inclusive, is the innocent-sounding explanation.In some areas, this is perfectly rational. Of course, wheelchair users visiting a National Trust property will have additional needs to someone able-bodied – and it’s right to spend time, money and effort to meet those needs. But in the context of race and ethnicity, the equity idea becomes much more pernicious. It essentially demands that we treat people of different races differently. Last week, a coalition of teaching unions called for equity to become standard practice even in nursery settings. It called on nursery staff to encourage dialogue and conversation about difference, instead of taking a colour-blind approach to education. In other words, this is the opposite of racial equality as it has been understood in the decades since the civil rights movement. Yet this version of anti-racism, pushed by an increasingly shrill race lobby, is being accepted by businesses, institutions and organisations up and down the land.Sadly not even the National Trust is immune to these trends. Though the growing backlash, from its members and volunteers, should be welcomed wholeheartedly.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid no10 treating public like fools","story":"It’s a process we have become wearily used to. Within minutes of Boris Johnson’s eye-popping claim that the plummeting rates of Covid hospitalisations and deaths since January “have not been achieved by the vaccination programme” but instead are overwhelmingly thanks to the lockdown, the internet was awash with confusion and dismay.Then came the pundits, attempting to interpret the true motivations of Mr Johnson’s statement like theologians interpreting a papal encyclical. Was he trying to steel us for a rise in cases in the coming months? Or attempting to dampen down enthusiasm at the newly opened pubs, having seen footage of revellers in Soho? Or simply seeking political cover for sticking to the ultra-cautious opening programme despite the slew of positive data?Alternatively, perhaps the Prime Minister had access to information he wasn’t telling us. Did he have advance sight of Wednesday’s ONS numbers on antibody prevalence, showing a slight falling off in protection levels among the oldest age groups? Or was there worrying behind-the-scenes data about the spread of the South African variant? On social media’s more conspiratorial fringes, the answer was obvious: Mr Johnson was softening us up for the next lockdown.It shouldn’t work like this. Something has gone badly wrong in our relationship with political leaders if the ulterior motive behind every utterance on public health needs to be considered alongside the statement itself, like an encryption key. New data from the YouGovCambridge opinion monitor shows that, on Covid, not a single one of the main information sources (including the Government) is trusted to be accurate by more than 50 per cent of the public. The Prime Minister scores a depressing 35 per cent. The sense that we have been “nudged” at every stage of the pandemic has made cynics of most of us.Meanwhile, the disconnect between what ordinary people can see with their own eyes and the Covid regulations only confirms the idea that Government pronouncements are no longer to be taken literally. The rules are starting to seem symbolic and removed, subject to broad reinterpretation. While the polling shows that people are content with the official pace of reopening, the mobility data (what people are actually doing) shows they have been quietly reopening their lives since January. Apple data now shows use of public transport in London up to nearly 70 per cent of normal from nearer 30 per cent at the start of this lockdown.On the one hand, daily deaths are heading towards single figures and daily cases are in the low thousands nationwide vaccine takeup is in the high-90s and the speed of the roll-out has exceeded all expectations. The sun is shining and the pubs and tattoo parlours are open. And yet university students still cannot access in-person learning and the Queen has to sit on her own at the funeral of her husband of 74 years. It’s not that the public is stupidly optimistic, they simply recognise the need to get on with life. Two double-vaccinated people will obviously meet up indoors, no matter what the official rules are. The rubric of Covid seems more and more performative, ceremonial, like an official language reserved for formal settings.That same YouGov study found that the European countries where trust in Covid information was highest were the Nordic countries. Their governments have had famously ergent Covid strategies, but their style of official communications is similar.Instead of pretending to know all the answers, leaders admit what they don’t know and what they got wrong – with the net effect that government and citizens consider themselves more on the same side against a shared foe in the virus. Despite all their difficulties, Sweden’s Covid boss, Anders Tegnell, remains broadly popular thanks to this straightforward style Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg volunteered that she regrets having closed schools earlier in the pandemic and the Danish government scores a stunning 73 per cent trust level on Covid information.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hong kong students invited handle rocket launchers day pro beijing","story":"Hong Kong school-children were on Thursday invited to handle rocket launchers and sing the Chinese national anthem during a day of activities designed to boost loyalty to Beijing.In classrooms across the city, students as young as six were given lessons on the draconian security law imposed last year as part of the first ‘National Security Education Day’.Pupils were told to write messages in praise of China on billboards as they took part in flag-raising ceremonies as well as pro-Beijing puzzles and games.At an open day at Hong Kong’s Police College, students were shown how to handle mock rocket-launchers as officers rappelled down from helicopters and took down \u0027terrorists\u0027 in mock-drills.Police also demonstrated a new goose-stepping march that mimics the style used by Chinese troops on the mainland.On the sidelines, guests wearing “I love police” t-shirts posed for selfies with a bear mascot dressed in a tactical uniform.Cuddly toy versions of the bear were also on sale for HK$400 (£38) alongside plastic toys of riot police officers holding shotguns and tear gas warning flags.At a morning ceremony attended by senior officials, Luo Huining, Beijing\u0027s top envoy in Hong Kong, gave a fiery speech vowing to “strike down hard resistance and regulate soft resistance”. Students were a key part of Hong Kong\u0027s fading protest movement and authorities have sought overhauls of the curriculum as they seek to instil broad fealty to the Communist Party. I wish China can be stronger and I support the national security law,” one pupil was shown to have written on their school billboard. However, elder pupils said the \u0027brainwashing\u0027 would not work across all classes.  “I feel it’s meaningless to have the day,” one student from a government school, who refused to give her full identity, told the . “No matter how many activities the government plan to do, it won’t change people’s minds that the government is not trustworthy.”“But I’m worried about the junior students who may be brainwashed by these events if more events other than quizzes creep into schools.”Four democracy activists meanwhile held a lonely rally flanked by dozens of police officers on Thursday morning as they condemned Beijing\u0027s security law, which threatens life imprisonment for a range of hazily-defined crimes including subversion and collusion with foreign forces.It has been used as a tool and a weapon to deprive us of our rights, to silence all dissent, to stop us from protesting, demonstrating, from forming organisations, activist Chow Hang-tung told reporters.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sign buddhist temple clock stopped fukushima earthquake restarts","story":"An 100-year-old clock that stopped working after the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011 has been rattled back to life by a recent quake.Bunshun Sakano, the head priest of Fumonji Temple, in the Miyagi Prefecture town of Yamamoto, said he has been “inspired” by the clock suddenly restarting.“It’s like a sign of encouragement that real restoration of the area is coming,” he told the Mainichi newspaper,.He said it had hardened his resolve to do more for local people still suffering the after-effects of what is known as the Great East Japan Earthquake. Mr Sakano purchased the clock in an antique shop in nearby Fukushima Prefecture a few years before the magnitude 9 tremor, the worst natural disaster in Japan’s history.Made by Seikosha, the predecessor of watch manufacturer Seiko, the large timepiece hung in a prominent place on a wall in the temple. But the temple, which is just a few hundred yards from the coast, was badly damaged by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.Flood waters rose above head height and left only the building\u0027s pillars and roof intact. Torn from the wall, the clock was eventually found floating along with other debris and was no longer working.The temple was eventually rebuilt and has since become a focal point of the community once again, but the stopped clock was considered beyond repair.Given it was one of the temple’s few surviving original fixtures, however, Mr Sakano hung it back on a wall anyway, a monument of sorts to the devastating disaster.It wasn\u0027t until after another earthquake - a delayed aftershock of the 2011 disaster - struck northeast Japan on February 13 this year that he heard something strange: a ticking sound.A decade on, the clock had started working again.A representative of Seiko, the clock\u0027s manufacturer, gave Mainichi newspaper a possible technical explanation: It\u0027s possible that the pendulum, which had stopped, started moving again with the shaking of the earthquake, or that dust that had built up inside came loose.But for Mr Sakano, there was something deeper at play. He has chosen to see it as a sign that he needs to help local residents to rebuild their lives, and “move forward with new determination” from those awful events of 2011.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us announces sanctions against russia expels 10 diplomats","story":"The United States announced economic sanctions against Russia on Thursday and the expulsion of 10 diplomats in retaliation for what Washington says is the Kremlin\u0027s US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.President Joe Biden\u0027s executive order sends a signal that the United States will impose costs in a strategic and economically impactful manner on Russia if it continues or escalates its destabilising international action, the White House said.The moves are in response to alleged interference in last year\u0027s presidential election as well as the hacking last year of federal government agencies. The US for the first time explicitly linked that intrusion to a Russian intelligence service.The sanctions have been foreshadowed for weeks by the administration and represent the first retaliatory action announced against the Kremlin for last year\u0027s hack, familiarly known as the SolarWinds breach.In that intrusion, Russian hackers are believed to have infected widely used software with malicious code, enabling them to access the networks of at least nine agencies in what US officials believe was an intelligence gathering operation aimed at mining government secrets.Besides that hack, US officials last month alleged that Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised influence operations to help Donald Trump in his unsuccessful bid for reelection as president, though there is no evidence Russia or anyone else changed votes or manipulated the outcome.A statement from the White House said the Kremlin made efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners.It also called out Russia\u0027s extraterritorial targeting of dissidents and journalists and undermining of security in countries important to US national security.Russia\u0027s foreign ministry said that the move contradicted Mr Biden\u0027s stated desire to normalise relations with Moscow, something he told Russian counterpart Mr Putin earlier this week.Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the US\u0027 hostile steps had dangerously raised the temperature of a confrontation between Moscow and Washington and that it would have to pay for damaging bilateral ties.We have repeatedly warned the United States about the consequences of their hostile steps which dangerously raise the temperature of confrontation between our two countries, Ms Zakharova told a news briefing.Such aggressive behaviour will without doubt receive a decisive rebuff. We need to recognise that someone needs to pay for the degradation in our bilateral relations. Responsibility for what is happening lies entirely with the United States, she said.In Brussels, the NATO military alliance said US allies support and stand in solidarity with the United States, following its 15 April announcement of actions to respond to Russia\u0027s destabilising activities.Allies are taking actions inidually and collectively to enhance the Alliance\u0027s collective security, a statement said.NATO members cited a sustained pattern of Russian behaviour, from aggression against Ukraine to interference in the US presidential election and cyber attacks.The alliance also condemned the nerve agent attack on Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, which it blames on Moscow, and said it was concerned by reports Russia had encouraged attacks againsts its troops in Afghanistan.Allies will continue to work in close consultation to address Russia\u0027s actions, which constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security, the statement said.We call on Russia to cease immediately its destabilising behaviour, and to uphold its international obligations.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vegan students have no right offended farming courses","story":"A few years ago I visited a well-known Aberdeen Angus cattle breeder whose animals had won numerous prizes for their excellence.

One of their beasts had won first prize at Smithfield Show and they were invited to follow the animal through the abattoir and see its carcass displayed by the butcher who had bought it. Neither of them could go. They loved their animals so much that it was too painful to see them killed. Just as the Walrus wept ‘with sobs and tears’, for the young oysters he and the Carpenter were consuming, so these two farmers, who had reared cattle all their lives, could not bear to see them turned into meat.When I was growing up there was an old woman who lived alone in the village and kept a couple of pigs on the swill from the kitchens of a hotel she worked in. When killing day came round she insisted on being present at the slaughter. She never failed to weep over the death of every pig she had reared and had become almost a friend. But she didn’t stop keeping them. She loved bacon and ham, black pudding and brawn – and she loved her pigs, for what they were and for what their lives and their necessary deaths meant to her. Quite apart from wondering why on earth Ms Willetts enrolled on an animal management course, might it not have been educational for her to learn about something as much a part of British life as farming? And to encounter something that might open her mind and even cause her to question her apparently protected ‘philosophical beliefs’?

Scientists at Nasa and Google guide the viewer through changes including forest change, urban growth, warming temperatures, sources of energy, and our world’s fragile beauty, in a set of timelapse videos.The Timelapse project was made by Nasa, the United States Geological Survey’s Landsat program, the world’s first civilian Earth observation program, and the European Union’s Copernicus satellites.A Google spokesman said: Our planet has seen rapid environmental change in the past half-century – more than any other point in human history. Many of us have experienced these changes in our own communities I myself was among the thousands of Californians evacuated from their homes during the state’s wildfires last year. For other people, the effects of climate change feel abstract and far away, like melting ice caps and receding glaciers. With Timelapse in Google Earth, we have a clearer picture of our changing planet right at our fingertips — one that shows not just problems but also solutions, as well as mesmerizingly beautiful natural phenomena that unfold over decades.Pan over the Amazon rainforest, and the human impact is seen in sharp relief. We all know the forest is disappearing at a rate of knots, but this shows the devastating loss of trees as the green fades to brown on our screens in such a short space of time.Perhaps the starkest example of urban growth over the last 37 years is Dubai. Google Timelapse shows the desert take shape into an urban metropolis, and you can watch as the artificial beaches are created.It is also strangely mesmerising to watch the housing sites and roads being built on the desert in Doha, Qatar, and view just how much humans have spread across the desert.You can also look at the snaking Thames and how London has grown in density over the decades. Although it is less dramatic than watching a city be built from scratch, it is still interesting to see how London has changed.Many parts of the world show the impact of a warming climate on Google Timelapse, but perhaps the best example is the Farmer Glacier in Antarctica. The video shows just how much the ice cap has melted, in real-time.Another victim of warming temperatures are our lakes, rivers and oceans. This video shows inland tributaries of the sea in Kazakhstan drying up.The ice caps can also be seen melting in quite a dramatic way at Cape Disappointment, in Antarctica. Though it is accepted that we need to move away from fossil fuels to stop the environmental destruction shown above, it is interesting to see just how much impact on the landscape wind farms have.This farm, in Kern County, California, was built in the last few decades, and the video shows the vastness of the project.Another human impact on the planet is mining. Multiple videos on the Google Timelapse show how deeply we have drilled into Planet Earth, but this copper mine in Utah makes particularly dramatic viewing.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"withdrawal afghanistan right call price","story":"As emotionally challenging as it might seem, President Biden’s decision to end the United States commitment to Afghanistan is probably the right call.Many American Presidents have come into power declaring they will end their country\u0027s involvement in the conflict, only to find themselves continually stuck in the mire. Having repeatedly pushed for a shrunken US presence during the Obama administration, Mr Biden is now finally in a position to force the decision through. It is exaggerated to say this is the end of American power, but it does highlight the limitations of a form of conflict that dominated the 2000s.While the initial impetus for going into Afghanistan was to destroy Al-Qaeda and punish those who supported it, as time went on it became clear that what the Western alliance was getting into was in fact merely the latest phase in a conflict that has been troubling Afghanistan for decades.Trying to resolve the larger conflict was something that would likely take generations of state building and transformation - none of which was necessarily wanted or accepted by everybody in Afghanistan.The invasion became a Sisyphean endeavour being carried out while people died, vast sums of money were spent and political capital slowly ebbed away.The other key lesson is being learned by insurgent and terrorist organizations, who can see once again that by simply holding on, victory against even the mightiest military machine is possible.While the direct threat to the west from terrorist groups in Afghanistan is vastly reduced (though not entirely gone away, there is a case currently on trial in Germany of a cell who were talking to the Islamic State in Afghanistan), Al-Qaeda will undoubtedly celebrate the victory loudly and the Taliban will no doubt present themselves as victors. Terrorists may gather again in the ungoverned spaces that emerge from the withdrawal. Nevertheless, it is far from clear that we will see another attack on the scale of September 11, 2001. Intelligence agencies are far savvier about the potential of such threats and while withdrawal means coverage of Afghanistan will go down, it will not entirely go away. Within Afghanistan, people are concerned about the Taliban\u0027s return of power and influence.An organization with a medievalist outlook that has not significantly changed in the past twenty years, it still clearly has substantial appeal among Afghans.Many in the country are doubtless concerned about a return to the civil war and warlordism that scourged the country during the 1990s. Both of these are sadly possible outcomes.But this is not the same country as it was before. And it is not clear that all the gains of the past two decades will immediately be lost.Regional powers still have a vested interest in ensuring that some stability exists, and that violence in the country does not get too out of hand.The key question in all of this, however, is what the Afghan people want and how their leaders will help them achieve it.

The Northern Ireland Protocol has been blamed as one of the factors behind the recent upsurge of violence in loyalist areas amid concerns in those communities it has weakened their place in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Protocol, goods moving from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland may be subject to checks. The measures are intended to protect the EU single market while maintaining an open land border between the North and the Republic in line with the Good Friday peace process. However, critics have warned that the way it has been implemented has given rise to renewed sectarian tensions, at the same time as hampering the free flow of goods within the UK. Meanwhile, relations between London and Brussels have been further strained after the EU announced last month it was taking legal action in response to a unilateral decision by the UK to extend a series of grace periods intended to ease the introduction of the new controls.

This meeting is part of our ongoing engagement with the EU to work through the outstanding issues with the protocol, in order to restore confidence on the ground, reflect the needs of communities and respect all dimensions of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, the spokesman said.

We have explained how this can be achieved and follow equality law.Parliamentary oversight of a time-limited scheme would make sure that it remains a proportionate way to keep private and public spaces COVID-secure and those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons have access to exemption documentation.Detailed guidance for employers and businesses would also minimise the risk of any discrimination.”If the Government chooses to impose certicates, Boris Johnson faces a revolt by backbench Conservatives opposed to vaccine passports."},{"url":null,"title":"ministers urged compensate students courses","story":"NewsMinisters urged to compensate students as some courses will end before Unis The Department for Education has confirmed remaining students in England wont be allowed tountil at least May - by which time some of their courses will have endedmirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMost students wontto in-person lessons until at least May \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It may only be a holiday home but it boasts aposthe best views in Cornwallapos, nestled among the trees above Porthkidney Sands beach in Carbis Bay. The cute beachfront bolthole looks out across the waves of St Ives Bay all the way to Godrevy Lighthouse. It is the perfect spot to watch wildle like seals and dolphins as well as boats and surfers and the new owners could be on the beach in minutes. But because of its timber construction, the property can only be used occasionally. It was built about  years ago in the garden of another property and the current owners have rented it out as a holiday let. The property has an entrance hall, open-plan vaulted ceiling reception room with a kitchen area and living dining room facing the views, a mezzanine with a king-size bed that looks out to the beach and a shower room. The property sits in a third of an acre but most of the land is coastal slope so it requires no maintenance. Because the beach can only be reached by foot and there are no car parks nearby, it remains fairly quiet all year round. At low tide the owners can walk  yards along the coastal path to get to the beach and at high tide they can swim off the rocks from the same position. Guy Morse from Lillicrap Chilcott said: We deal with an awful lot of very nice properties in our office but most of us agree, this is the best view in Cornwall. Itaposs absolutely mind-blowing. Rather than looking out to sea, youaposre just looking straight down the line of the water so you have the waves coming across in front of you and it leads round to Godrevy Lighthouse.  Thereaposs just something about the view thataposs ridiculously special. Youaposve also got the Hayle Estuary so you get all the boats coming and going and all the fish shoal around the mouth of the estuary so you get seals, dolphins and gannets ing, itaposs all happening right in front of you. Itaposs just incredible. The person that wants a bit of seclusion and that feeling you have left the world behind when you step onto the coast path will love it.

This fire-and-rehire tactic, to impose pay cuts and longer hours, is a national disgrace that should be outlawed immediately. But the privatised energy supplier is, unfortunately, not alone in exploiting weak laws that leave British workers vulnerable. British Gas owner Centrica risks a backlash from customers angered by the mistreatment of skilled workers who fix problems in their essential home devices and keep them safe. In Britain, workers have fewer legal rights than employees in other major nations. As the senior executives of British Gas earn eye-boggling amounts, many will feel it is not fair to clobber the grafters who – until this week – were the firm’s most valuable assets. End cronyism By whipping Conservative MPs to block Labour’s plan for a wider inquiry into corruption, Boris Johnson makes himself look like a PM with something to hide. The more limited internal investigation, initiated by a Premier without a moral compass of his own, is insufficient. A culture of cronyism and back-scratching in Whitehall has clearly been exposed. The fact that Johnson’s predecessor David Cameron is at the heart of this scandal underlines the urgent need for transparency. The chumminess and cosiness must end, replaced by open and professional dealings. No wonder Johnson, too often a stranger to the truth and probity, is desperate to remain in control of what the public finds out.

It could create a situation where people from groups where vaccine take up is lower are barred from social events, venues and even travel.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stressed no plans have yet been finalised but the idea is currently being examined. A review found they could potentially play a role in settings such as theatres, nightclubs and mass events in the months ahead.They are also being considered for use in pubs and restaurants to reduce social distancing restrictions. But the commission says they could create a two-tier society whereby only certain groups are able to fully enjoy their rights. The watchdog also warned employers should not be allowed to hire workers on a “no jab, no job” policy. It said: “There is a risk of unlawful discriminationdecisions taken in this process disadvantage people with protected characteristics who have not received, or are not able to receive, the vaccine, unless they can be shown to be justied. “Any mandatory requirement for vaccination or the implementation of Covid-status certication may amount to indirect discrimination, unless the requirement can be objectively justied.” Chair of the EHRC, Baroness Kishwer Falkner, saysthe go-ahead is given, any such freedom passes must be time-limited. She added that those who cannot take the vaccine must have easy-to-access exemption. We would monitor the rollout to ensure the right balance is struck between protecting the publicaposs health and our inidual freedoms, she said.The potential use of certicates - which would include vaccination status, test results or evidence of someone having contracted and recovered from Covid- - is opposed by at least  Conservative MPs and Labour is also sceptical about the measure.  Since the government report, the Cabinet Office has ruled out the documents ever being necessary on public transport or in essential shops.

Thomas Mabbitt, , suffered the serious head injury after being knocked off his bike on February  and was admitted to St Maryaposs Hospital, in Paddington, London. Mum Julie Mabbitt told his employers about the accident the following day, and when Thomas awoke two weeks later, he texted them the awful news that he was facing rehab due to brain damage. Despite sending a third update on his condition on February , Julie was horried when her son received an email informing him they would be sending him his P due to his aposcontinual non-attendanceapos. The -year-old also claims that despite her son signing a contract stating he would be on £ an hour, the branch sent over a new version which lowered his pay to just £. - reducing the amount he believes he was owed for his shts by £. After the furious mum emailed his bosses to complain, emails show they quickly backtracked and claimed they never raised his P in the end and put it down to a aposmiscommunicationapos. Julie claims Dominoaposs behaviour has only made Thomasapos ordeal even worse, as the youngster faces a long journey of recovery, as he is now classed as a vulnerable adult and worries over his future employment opportunities. Dominoaposs have since expressed their apossincere apologiesapos to Thomas and his mum and have confirmed they are investigating the incident, while confirming Thomasapos position remains open under the aposoriginal contract termsapos. Julie, from Watford, said: I think itaposs absolutely awful. They said there was a miscommunication, but at the end of the day, we had informed them [Thomas was ill]. They tried to sack him while he was in intensive care with brain damage.  I told them he was in hospital with an accident on February . Dominoaposs said it was a miscommunication. They should have all my details. If they wanted to know about Thomas, they should have contacted me asking how Thomas is and whataposs going on, but they didnapost. They went and text Thomas. Thomas informed them he had brain damage and a bleed on the brain, then they continued to [try to] fire him a few days later. Thomas was worried in general. He has no income, heaposs having to sign on and heaposs got nothing to look forward to. Iaposm paying his bills for him and he didnapost need the added aggro of being emailed and texted by them.  Thomas was lying in hospital recovering while his mum fought his side with Dominoaposs, emailing a member of staff to try and get hold of his contract for insurance purposes. She claims after sending one contract stating her sonaposs hourly rate was £, the employee attempted to recall the email three times, before providing an aposamendedapos contract stating he was on £. per hour instead. Julie said: While he was in hospital, I informed Dominoaposs store manager that my son was involved in an accident and wonapost be coming in. He was in hospital for two weeks, then went into a rehab unit. In that time, his manager text him and Thomas went aposIaposve got a bleed on the brain and brain damageapos. On the Monday, he got an email from a manager saying heaposd been fired. They emailed him. Bearing in mind I had informed them, and Thomas had text them, saying he was in hospital and had a bleed on the brain.  I was like aposyou canapost fire someone while theyaposre in hospital and I have informed youapos. I kept saying to them can I have Thomasapos contract [and saying] I want to know his wages, what heaposs entitled to. All I really wanted was his contract because weaposre going through a personal injury claim. Iaposve even stated I need the contract for legal reasons, then theyaposve done all this, amending their contracts. Itaposs awful. Theyaposve emailed his contract which states he was on £ an hour.

They then sent me a new email, with a contract saying he was on £.. Luckily, Thomas had a photo of the original contract stating he was on £ per hour. I managed to claw back about £ of what Tomaposs [earned]. They now said theyaposve kept his job open, but Iaposve had no other correspondence from them at all. They turned around and said theyaposre not firing him now, theyaposre retracting it. Heaposs still on their books.

But after being discharged, headaches she had suffered with for years got progressively worse.Lying permanently flat on her back is the only way the -year-old can relieve the pain, and she now relies on her familyaposs support for almost everything. Gaby, from Crookham Village, Hampshire, said after multiple misdiagnoses she was eventually formally diagnosed with a CSF leak, after much research of her own. Have you suffered something similar to Gaby  Let us know at webnews@mirror Her brain fluid is escaping through a microscopic tear in the spinal cord and remaining horizontal is the only way to balance it out and relieve her pain and neurological symptoms such as blurred vision, nausea and extreme dizziness. Since November she has been awaiting a risky operation to repair the hole, after an initial simpler procedure failed. And – in part due to the pandemic – this wonapost happen until at least September.Gaby, who worked as a freelance subeditor before her condition forced her to quit, said she had been essentially left to self-diagnose through Google for years.She believes the tear likely occurred nine years ago and has slowly got progressively worse since. “I’ve paid thousands for scans, some of which have been a total waste of money,” she told the Mirror. “I have had little guidance and help from the medical community.“I believe thousands of others who have been wrongly diagnosed with ‘migraine’ have a CSF Leak – caused by something like an epidural, or just spontaneously because they have wear and tear on their spine or an underlying connective tissue issue.” Gaby continued: “The medical community is very unaware of this and I have seen dozens of doctors who simply do not understand them, leading to many [people] being ignored.”Through a Facebook group run by UK-based charity CSF Leaks Association, she has learned of people who have taken their own lives because the condition “completely steals any kind of le you may have”.Gaby was diagnosed with scoliosis – a curvature of the spine – when she was  and prior to her stroke was told her increasing back pain and headaches were probably down to that, before doctors suggested it could actually be labyrinthitis. An osteopath believed she may be hypermobile and in early  a rheumatologist then diagnosed her with mild Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a group of rare conditions that affect connective tissues. At the severe end of the spectrum sufferers struggle to breathe independently, while others can be left wheelchair bound. CSF leaks can be experienced by women after giving birth via C-section, which involves injecting an epidural into the spine, and can cause a minute tear. Gaby understands that EDS is “probably  percent the reason why people have a spontaneous leak for no reason”.  When itaposs not caused by something like an epidural injection, where the tear is clearly located, trying to find the source is “like trying to find a needle in a haystack”. “The problem is... they have to go and find the leak they have to do a CT myelogram, pushing fluorescent liquid into the spinal cord, she added. “Itaposs a pretty nasty procedure, just to find the leak. “I think a lot of hospitals, they just havenapost got the training in it, they donapost know what they are doing. “Itaposs messing with the spinal cord and I think a lot of hospitals just donapost want to get involved with that.” After her EDS diagnosis, Gaby said she “started going downhill with the pain in my head”. “I was getting to the point where I could barely sit up at work because the pain was horrendous. “I was getting very blurry eyes and when I was walking along I couldnapost tell the depth of the floor.”  This all came to a head in June  when she was taken to AE with a suspected stroke after losing the feeling in the left side of her body. After three days in a hospital bed, the feeling came back and she was told it was likely a hemiplegic migraine. But Gaby has rapidly deteriorated since then, and can no longer work as she can only sit upright for minutes before the headaches become unbearable. She continued: “I canapost do anything, I canapost go anywhere, the only places Iaposve been in the last couple of years have been to go to hospital appointments. Itaposs very debilitating.” Asked to describe her pain, she said: “The headaches are mainly at the back of the head, but it radiates all down your back. “So my spine is agony, down the back of my neck is agony, itaposs like itaposs on fire. “Then I start getting very blurred vision, it just feels like my eyes have been smeared with cream, and you canapost see properly.” Still unconvinced she had been properly diagnosed, Gaby persisted and her rheumatologist agreed her symptoms were not a migraine.  Initially, he thought it could be a Chiari malformation but after finally being diagnosed with a CSF leak, in December  she was given a blood patch at Stoke University Hospital, which involves injecting blood into the spinal cord to block the leak. However, it didnapost work, in part because doctors were not able to find exactly where the tear was. And while waiting a year for another emergency patch, she paid to see a private surgeon in London who specialises in leaks and who was able to pinpoint where her tear was. But because of her scoliosis, he told her another patch wonapost work and she needs an operation.

The Duke of Sussex landed back in the UK on Tuesday ahead of his grandfatheraposs send off on Saturday. Journalist and author Tom Bower, who wrote Rebel Prince, a biography of the Prince Philip, believes that while Monarchaposs focus will be solely on her late husband, sheaposs also hoping to spend time with her grandson. Writing for the Sun, he said: If, in the sight of Philipaposs coffin and his grieving grandmother, he is contrite, he might begin to rebuild a relationship with Charles and William. Philip would have been the first to advise his grandson that he will never find permanent peace and happiness estranged from his family, just relying on Hollywoodaposs superficial celebrities. But he believes that while the Queen is undoubtably mortied by Harryaposs disloyalty, he predicts she will use the opportunity to bring the family back together. Bower adds: If Harry decides to stay in Britain for a few days, she will undoubtably use the opportunity to broker peace. The death of a loved one is always a reason to urge the living to forgive and love one another.  Due to Covid restrictions, just  guests will be allowed at Prince Philipaposs funeral in Windsor on Saturday afternoon. In line with his wishes, heaposs having a military funeral rather than a state one. It will be the first time Harry has seen his family since March , when the Sussexes attended the Commonwealth Day service - their final royal engagement. Since then he has hit out at his family in a shocking interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which he accused his father and brother of being trapped. Meghan made every effort to attend Philipaposs funeral but has been advised not to by her doctors. She is heavily pregnant with the coupleaposs second child, a baby girl, believed to be due in June.  Earlier this week Harry shared a moving tribute to his grandfather, describing him as the legend of banter. He wrote: My grandfather was a man of service, honour and great humour. He was authentically himself, with a seriously sharp wit, and could hold the attention of any room due to his charm—and also because you never knew what he might say next.He will be remembered as the longest reigning consort to the Monarch, a decorated serviceman, a Prince and a Duke. But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end.

I never liked him and I was glad to see the back of him. When my granddaughter was eight months old, my daughter met a lovely man and they married six months later. He’s the only father my ­granddaughter has ever known. However, my granddaughter is now six, and I worry that they’ve never told her the person she thinks is her father isn’t her biological dad. I’ve spoken to my daughter about it, and she wants to tell her, but keeps putting it off. They’ve since gone on to have two children of their own, and my heart breaks to think of my little granddaughter one day finding out that the boys she thinks are her brothers are her half brothers. Not that it matters, but it’s the not knowing part that I think she’ll struggle with. I also worry that , one day, her real dad comes back on the scene she’ll be angry with her mum – and all of us – for not telling her. What do you think we should do  Coleen says She needs to know the truth too, and the sooner the better. If she finds out when she’s , she’ll be mad that nobody told her. Buther mum tells her now, she’ll probably think about it for a bit, then go and play with her toys. She’ll have questions, of course, and for those I would suggest getting a really good book on the subject. If you do a search on Amazon, there will be all kinds of books on this topic. The worst thing to happen issomebody just blurts it out when she’s older or, like you say,her dad comes back into the picture and you’re all forced to tell her.

Lindsey Prior-Mckie, who runs Super Swim Academy, opened a facility at her home in Scarborough this week offering guest bookings and one-to-one lessons in the aposEndless Poolapos. The four-metre pool, which was built and shipped from the USA, allows swimmers to swim in one place in much the same way as a treadmill does for runners.After receiving a bounce-back loan from the government, Mrs Prior-Mckie spent around £, on the pool and a partial conversion of her house to accommodate customers in a coronavirus compliant way.Mrs Prior-McKie said her initial idea had been to buy a property in which to develop a ‘swim gym’ fitted out with three Endless Pools. She said she wanted to offer “a completely dferent concept to what people think of as swimming that was more private and less restrictive than a public pool, with personalised service allowing for quick development. After five years holding onto a catalogue for the Endless Pool, she had decided by February  to go ahead with her plans - but the ensuing pandemic quickly put a halt to that. The closure of public pools during lockdown meant an uncertain future for her and partner Claire’s swimming businesses, and Mrs Prior-Mckie found the period dficult. “With me not being able to swim I found myself getting a bit tetchy, I needed to be in water, it was kind of like a fish being put out on land,” she said. Left in limbo and unsureor when public pools would ever re-open, Mrs Prior-Mckie came up with the creative solution of setting up a pool at home. “Without water you’re a bit restricted for a swimming business,” she said. “It’s an opportunity to make a long-term investment for us and for our family, and for the business. After her and her partneraposs swimming businesses received the loans, they realised they might be able to make this more modest plan work and decided to take the plunge in ordering an Endless Pool.

It was hot and it was everywhere and it didnapost burn her thank god. She had to go and get changed at home, so she had to actually drive and go and get changed, luckily they were all local.

Alexander White, , from Sydney, Australia, bought a twin-pack of baby cos lettuce while shopping in his local Aldi store with partner Amelie Neate, , on Monday. While unpacking his shopping on the kitchen table, Alexander noticed what he thought was a large worm moving around inside the bag. The creature then stuck its long tongue out and I realised it was a small snake, he explained. I then freaked out and called my partner to come and have a look - she of course didnapost believe me when I called out apossnake in the lettuceapos. The pair realised the bag was open, with Alexander having carried it around the shop in his arms.Have you made a similar discovery  Let us know at webnews@mirrorLuckily my children were not home at the time as I may have asked them to unpack the shopping and I would hate to think what may have happened, said the dad. The snake and lettuce were moved into a large Tupperware container and wildle rescue organisation Wires were informed. Going by Alexanderaposs descriptions he was told it was likely a baby Eastern brown - a highly venomous snake.  But on sending over photos, they determined it was actually a pale headed snake, another venomous species. He described it as being medically signicant, meaning thatit were to bite someone they would need to get to hospital very quickly, Alexander said. Due to the dangerous iety of snake, the call handler organised for a snake catcher volunteer to quickly come and pick up the snake around .pm the same evening.  Before it was taken away, Amelie, originally from Austria, took a video of the snake to send to family members, as well as holding a video call with their children who are away for school holidays. And Alexander sent pictures of the snake to Aldiaposs customer service team. He wrote: The package does not mention baby snakes, just baby cos lettuce. So I think it might be an issue with the product.  Iaposm too nervous to make a salad now, which we were planning to have for dinner. A spokesperson for Aldi said: Weaposve worked with the customer and the team at WIRES to identy the snakeaposs natural habitat, which is certainly not an ALDI store. We thank WIRES for their support on this. We are working closely with our produce supplier to investigate how this incident could have possibly occurred. With the supermarketaposs help, Wires traced the origin of the lettuce back to Toowoomba, and are attempting to organise transport home for the snake. After the handler took the snake away, Alexander ate the lettuce for lunch.“I washed it thoroughly, he told the .

The First  Days # is out now and jam-packed with football wisdom.Co-authored with head teacher Phil Denton, whom Mellon met while manager of Tranmere Rovers, The First  Days: Lessons In Leadership From The Football Bosses is full of big names and even bigger ideas.With contributions from the likes of Sam Allardyce, David Moyes and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Mellon#s book is designed to be a manual to help guide gaffers through their first few months at a new club.The -page paperback is also an entertaining read for fans, Arabs or otherwise, as Mellon es deep into the minds of top managers to discover what makes them tick.Calum Woodger got his hands on a copy and this is what he found out#Following completion of the book, Mellon and Denton got together to discuss his first  days at the Tannadice helm.It#s a small but revealing section of the read, hidden in the postscript towards the end of the book, where Mellon explains how he has become #a better manager# through the writing process.The United gaffer also lts the lid on his deep affinity for the club born out of the values of his Glasgow upbringing.He reveals one of his mum#s favourite sayings: #What#s for you won#t go by you#.It seems true in the case of the marriage of Mellon and the Tangerines.He said: #I had a good chat with the owners and saw how they operated.#I liked what they had to say and I saw that they were ambitious but realistic, which is what you need.#I then got to know this town and this club. I used to pretend I was a Dundee United player when I was a boy.#I knew all about the history of the club and what a magnicent support base they have.#I got really excited about living and working here. Like I#ve said before, it#s like starting a new relationship.#It#s easy to get lost in the football aspect of the book and forget about the headline act # lessons in leadership.Throughout the read, you see Mellon and Denton#s relationship blossom from a chance encounter between strangers in a hotel gym to sitting down like old mates at the end to discuss their journey.Denton details that first meeting extensively in the introduction, labelling them an #unlikely duo#.Throughout, they travel theand breadth of England together # delving into stories from further afield, too # on a quest to uncover how the best and brightest in sport operate.Micky Mellon interview: What did Dundee United boss learn from co-writing book featuring contributions from Guardiola, Solskjaer, Moyes and Dyche \" title\"#Micky Mellon interview: What did Dundee United boss learn from co-writing book featuring contributions from Guardiola, Solskjaer, Moyes and Dyche # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-boss-micky-mellon-urges-managers-to-be-prepared-for-anything-as-new-book-is-launched embed # secrethitLFXqkJ\" data-secret\"hitLFXqkJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Denton makes it clear that, although they seemed worlds apart on the face of it, scratch beneath the surface and the pair are actually more alike than not.#On that first day, we did not know where things would go but we both knew we could learn a great deal from each other,# he said.#Despite our fields being dferent # Micky#s football leadership and mine educational # we saw so many common concepts that intrigued us both.##Let#s keep in touch# said Micky, #we#re going to learn a lot from each other.##And there it was.

We spoke to them about what an honour it was to be at Manchester United,# Solskjaer recalled.#We talked about high expectations, having some fun and even surprising a few people. #Let#s enjoy one day at a time and start winning again#.#Later that day, I remember walking out and hearing people saying, #Finally, we#re talking about being Manchester United again#.#For all the words of wisdom from gaffers, The First  Days also offers those with a more analytical brain to understand how a winning team is built and managed.Admittedly, the concepts aren#t for everyone.However, as a fan, it#s good to know there#s more to team talks than Football Manager lets on.There#s a whole chapter on what goes on in the dressing-room, in fact, as Mellon and Denton get their teeth into days  to .Something called the Sunflower Team Talk # seed, soil, flower, weather # from #data rich# boss Allardyce#s back catalogue is a good example.Denton explained: #The performance of a team is like a sunflower.#The flower will grow in the right environment to a great height. However, ious factors need to be in place to ensure it grows to its full potential.#Firstly, the seed and the ability of the seed to actually grow. In a football sense, can the players on the field actually deliver what is asked of them #Secondly, is the soil conducive to the growth of this flower  Thirdly, will the words used to direct and galvanise be the weather conditions required to stimulate that growth #If the aforementioned isn#t enough to make you consider shelling out your hard-earned to read the United boss# book, the knowledge of it#s impact on the game and society as a whole might just sway you.Denton and Mellon are donating all proceeds from the book to the Len Johnrose Trust # a charity set up in the name of Mellon#s former Burnley team-mate who, in , was diagnosed with motor neurone disease .Speaking about Johnrose, Micky said: #Len is an inspirational guy.#I was inspired when I played alongside him but I am in awe of him now.#It was very important to me that this book helped people. If it can go a small way to helping Len and the MND Association then it will make all our effort worthwhile.#Micky Mellon#s book # The First  Days # is out now and available online and in bookshops.ERIC NICOLSON: Why a summer parting of the ways could be right for Doncaster Rovers target Micky Mellon AND Dundee United\" title\"#ERIC NICOLSON: Why a summer parting of the ways could be right for Doncaster Rovers target Micky Mellon AND Dundee United# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp the-doncaster-solution-summer-parting-of-the-ways-could-be-right-for-micky-mellon-and-dundee-united embed # secretZqeYskQW\" data-secret\"ZqeYskQW\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/Sei-Whale-in-the-Firth-of-Forth_173386677_10160801355562519_1165421773107018955_n_38594708-e1618489450668-940x564.jpg ","title":"watch as one of the worlds largest whales visits the forth","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA video shot by two Fe teenagers captured the moment one of the largest whales in the world visited the Firth of Forth.The relatively rare sighting of a Sei Whale prompted huge excitement among whale watchers in the UK, with visits to semi-enclosed waters like the Forth thought to be uncommon.But whilst they knew they were lucky to spot the huge animal in the Firth of Forth, the two girls who filmed it didn#t realise how important it was.Agathe, , managed to capture video footage alongside her sister Sidonie, , of the whale#s blow.

line for £million worth of investmentits business improvement district is retained.Firms in an area stretching theof Union Street and from John Street to Union Square will vote on the future of Aberdeen Inspired in June.In preparation for the ballot, the organisation has launched its business plan for the - period.The group expect to bring in £. million in levies in that time and has set out how it plans to reinvest the money in the city centre – and how it plans to double it through sponsorship and other funding streams.Details on the city#s Covid- recovery are included, and outline a vision of an #evolving city centre that retains its character, heritage and accessibility but becomes richer in culture, innovation, sustainability and ersity#.Further proposals include deep cleaning streets and developing cafe culture.There are also plans to bring more “world-class” events to the city, and install floral displays and “parklets”, particularly in neglected areas.Aberdeen Inspired chief executive Adrian Watson said: “Following a year of unprecedented challenges for the UK high street and businesses of all sizes, our focus for the next few years is firmly on supporting our local businesses as we work together to recover and rebuild Aberdeen’s city centre.#Our new business plan sets out how we intend to do thiswe secure a successful vote in June. Aberdeen Inspired has been a vocal and united force in the city centre throughout the pandemic, supporting businesses and representing them in driving the city centre masterplan forward. Our voice will be needed more than ever as we embark on the road to recovery. #We want to continue Aberdeen Inspired’s programmes and activities, such as community hubs and festivals, which have already helped rejuvenate the city centre and will be vital in restoring city centre confidence.#He added: #By leading the city centre’s recovery and encouraging initiatives that will deliver a truly dferentiated offering, fit for the new post-Covid world, we will be at the forefront of reinvention and, ultimately, revival, ensuring that Aberdeen stands out as an attractive place to visit with a vibrant and appealing city centre that is rich in culture, retail and entertainment.”Aberdeen Inspired has operated for the last  years and is funded through levies from businesses within the city centre.It takes in more than £million a year from around  business within the area.The body is responsible for events in the city such as the Nuart street art festival.Earlier this week councillors

conduct mock negotiation exercises relating to partnership and lease disputes and were scored across the two scenarios on their preparation, conduct of the negotiation and post-negotiation reflection.The international championships are being hosted by the National University of Singapore, but sadly the Scottish pair won’t be jetting off to an exotic location.Thanks to the current Covid-

Edward Mountain, Donald Cameron and Jamie Halcro Johnston.Mr Halcro Johnston made it to Holyrood after Mr Ross was elected to Westminster in .Mr Ross was askedhe is worried about losing senior members of the party’s front-bench, such as Mr Cameron, who was health spokesman, and Mr Halcro Johnston, who led on tourism and the rural economy.He said: “I absolutely want Donald and Jamie and as many Scottish Conservatives to join me in Holyrood after the election, and the fact is we got three from the Highlands and Islands list last time.“We actually came very close to getting a fourth – andjust a couple of hundred Scottish Labour voters had voted for the Scottish Conservatives, we would have had a fourth MSP in the Highlands and Islands.“Again, that shows that when people in the Highlands and Islands are looking at their party list vote,they want to elect MSPs which will challenge the SNP, which will stand up to the Nationalists, which will fight to stop another independence referendum, they should unite behind the Scottish Conservatives.“In that way we canexperienced MSPs and MSPs who will stop another independence referendum and stop that SNP majority.”As well as the

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day.

He thought he was excellent.“He has great experience and he has worked under some terric coaches at Atlanta United and through his playing career.“Stephen has a great background as a player and he has had a great grounding as a coach.“I’m excited. I think Stephen is a great coach and it is an exciting time for the club and the fans.“Hopefully this is the start of a new era.”Clark believes the period between now and the end of the season will be vital for Glass as he assesses his squad.The Dons have several key first team players out of contract at the end of the season, including Tommie Hoban, Niall McGinn, Ash Taylor, Michael Devlin and Greg Leigh, as well as Shay Logan and Bruce Anderson, who are on loan at Hearts and Hamilton respectively.It has been reported that Glass is keen to keep Anderson at the club and will offer him a new deal.Loan players Callum Hendry, Florian Kamberi, Fraser Hornby and goalkeeper Gary Woods are all due toto their parent clubs.The former Dons goalkeeper added: “When Derek McInnes joined Aberdeen, he had a period at the end of the season and that would have helped him. I’m sure it will be the same for Stephen.“It is not an easy job. There are several players out of contract, so he has to get that sorted.“He also has the loan players and I don’t knowthey will be looking to try to keep any of them at the club.”@AberdeenFC🎙️ Listen to this week#s Northern Goal podcast here:Apple: https:t.co LfaEKWOdySpoty: https:t.co QwsgAtj pic ZeukIXbmdash EveningExpress SportApril , For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"june target for competitive shinty return","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown. We have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust, like everyone , to the daily challenges this  has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we’re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side.

But most areas of Argyll suffer the same blight whenever the sun shines.There are popular runs and circuits for urban bikers.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"health and social interim boss appointed","story":"Kathie GrfithsUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The new release further reinforces the sentiment that the s will be the decade of small satellites, anticipating the launch of close to , smallsats before .The main driver for this continued growth during a time where many face pandemic-related challenges is plans for satcom broadband ldquomega-constellations and the continuous necessity for replenishment launches. Of all smallsats to be launched, % are expected to be part of constellations. Furthermore, the smallsat manufacturing and launch market are set to do more than triple over the next decade, to  billion and  billion respectively, driven by the multiplication of constellation projects from both commercial and government stakeholders. Euroconsult, who operate from locations across North America, Europe and Asia and specialise in the space sector and satellite enabled verticals, have released their updated findings at a time when launch rates are at least on par with last year, suggesting that the era of the mega-constellation has truly arrived.Flagship examples of low earth orbitbroadband constellations, such as SpaceXrsquos Starlink and Amazonrsquos Kuiper, account for almost half of the projected demand over -.

The Euroconsult report incorporates new content to help give decision makers key knowledge in this area, as well as a reviewed and up-to-date forecast accounting for the economic situation and impact of COVID-.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"junior rugby club pays tribute to dedicated coach","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He worked extremely hard behind the scenes to ensure the smooth running of the organisation and was always striving to raise extra funds to provide the youngsters with the very best.#What you saw is what you got with John, and I#m sure everyone who knew him would agree with that.#John was a proper family man, who cared greatly for his loved ones and would always share stories about his grandchildren.#He was very supportive within the community, with all sporting activities, and encouraged the positive impact of sport for young people.#His passion was rugby and he made a real effort to talk to everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him.#John will be greatly missed by all the children, coaches and supporters of the club, and also within our community. We hope we can continue to make him proud and work towards fulfilling his vision for the club.#His dedication and commitment to the club was extraordinary, and his boots will be hard to fill. Rest easy, John.#"},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created.

But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

It has been such a tough time for them and their parents and carers, so I felt it was important for them to have something fun to do.#I remember how much we loved going to Carradale as a family for its egg hunt, so I thought why not bring it to town.#I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who took part and helped in any way to make this such a successful event. We made up  bags and just  were left!#Mandy added that the chocolate treats were purchased with a donation from The Jolly Monday Show from sales of Jerusalema dance stickers some art packs were donated by Peaches and Dreams Crafts, and the other items were purchased by The Hub through funding from Children in Need for activities for young people the sheets with the clues were printed by Keeping It Local and the orienteering clips used as stamps were on loan from Stuart McQuaker and the Physical Education department at Campbeltown Grammar School."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 9 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As a result, a number of people have been reported to the procurator fiscal.This week, once again, the team has been in action. A property in Campbeltown town centre was searched under warrant and a -year-old man and a -year-old woman reported to the procurator fiscal.Inspector Tom Harper told The Courier: ‘Recent changes in our sht pattern for officers’ work hours to make them more efficient have enabled us to use our resources to create a small pro-active team which is concentrating on drug abuse in the town.‘And we have had good and sufficient intelligence for four drugs search warrants to be executed in recent weeks.’As a result of that, two people have been reported for being concerned in the supply of drugs and the other two were for drug possession.This will continue for the foreseeable future as drug use and drug dealing has been identied as one of the greatest concerns in the community.This month, Strathclyde Police is to consult with the public on its community policing plan for the coming year. The top four concerns for Kintyre and the islands of Gigha, Jura and Islay, as well as drugs, are: anti-social behaviour, assault, violent crime and speeding motorists.TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOBid to protect Sanda birdsThree Kintyre islands have been designated a conservation area in a bid to halt the decline of a species of seabird.Sanda and its surrounding islands of Sheep and Glunimore have been named as a Site of Special Scientic Interest by Scottish National Heritageas a result of the high level of shags which breed on the small group of islands.Nationally important birds such as razorbill, cormorant and puffin also breed on the islands which form the most southerly breeding area in the British Isles for the storm petrel and Manx shearwater.The islands are owned by Dick Gannon and his we Meg, both of whom live in Campbeltown. The couple are glad the wildle to be found on and around the islands had been formally recognised.Meg Gannon said: ‘The wildle on the islands has always been a great delight to us and we take its conservation seriously in all that we do on Sanda.‘The recognition by SNH that the islands are worthy of scientic designation is most welcome at this time.’Dick Gannon added: ‘We are very pleased. We have always had a green attitude on the island.’The Gannons are currently refurbishing all of the island’s properties into self-catering houses.FIFTY YEARS AGOAmericans interested in CampbeltownThe results of a small advertising spree in the USA, which cost Campbeltown Town Council £, were made known at the council’s finance committee meeting on Monday evening.Town clerk Mr William Wilson reported he had received four replies, from industrialists and one from a real estate agent.One firm, from Florida, claims to be the makers of the word’s finest rear view traffic mirrors. Another firm was involved in the plastics industry.Mr Wilson raised a laugh when he said the real estate agent wanted to #sell’ Campbeltown.On a more serious vein, Councillor Dan Black said he thought the £ was a worthwhile investment and considered it should be spent in a similar manner annually.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe mining crisisOnce again, the country has been plunged into industrial chaos by a national strike of miners.One of the most calamitous results of the great coal strike last autumn was the loss to the British coal trade of the continental market.The immediate and inevitable result must be a rise in the cost of living, because the food which was paid for by coal must now be bought in some other way, while the ships which used to sail from these shores laden with coal must now sail in ballast and make all their profits upon the homeward voyage.But it need scarcely be pointed out that the greatest sufferers have been the miners themselves, who have been condemned by the misguided policy of their leaders to severe and increasing unemployment.In these circumstances, the action which the Miners’ Executive has seen fit to take in calling a second strike is the more suicidal, since they have the lessons of the past three months vividly before their eyes.The first evidence that once again the miners are signing their own death warrant is already to hand.One of the largest firms of coal merchants in this country received, on the eve of the strike, news from New York that the American Coal Exchange was already flooded with inquiries from continental countries.Now that the strike has been declared, these inquiries must inevitably result in contracts stretching in all probability over a period of years.The result will be that however the contest is decided, and however hard the miners may subsequently be pleased to work and however cheap the price at which British coal is offered on the market, practically the entire field will already be occupied by foreign competitors and the British export market for coal will be seriously, and perhaps fatally, narrowed.The effect of that must be a corresponding rise in the cost of living and delay in that fall in the cost of production which alone can win back for this country its supremacy of the markets of the world."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Demand was so high, however, that another  bottles were released.Bottle number one was auctioned off on April , the day the helipad was deemed operational, with  per cent of the winning £ bid, placed by Campbeltown man Lewis Nelson, being donated to SKDT.Beinn an Tuirc Distillers director Emma Macalister Hall met with Lewis and SKDT manager Eric Spence last week, to give Lewis bottle number one and present Eric with a cheque for the total £, raised.Lewis, who had to fight for the bottle after a bidding war broke out, said: #It#s a nice way to support the project — and it#s also a good way to get a nice bottle of gin!#He added that he is actually teetotal so the bottle will serve as a memento of the occasion.Eric said: I#d really like to thank Beinn an Tuirc Distillers — it#s a fantastic amount raised.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page. Search #Lindsay Ramsay Walk at Westport# on www.justgivingLindsay is well on her way towards her fundraising target, having already received donations amounting to more than £ by the time the Courier went to press.A Macmillan Cancer support spokesperson said: #At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we#ve got. If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious. I have rarely met someone so filled with optimism.ldquoWith his lsquogo get lsquoemrsquo attitude, he settled into Ross High School very quickly and it was a pleasure to have him here. Irsquom delighted to hear that he is still playing and wish him all the very best."},{"url":null,"title":"progress-made-900-000-preston-tower-plans","story":"Councillors agreed to set aside pound, last September to restore Preston Tower, with the money previously earmarked for a controversial car park off Haddingtonrsquos Whittingehame Drive.East Lothian Council announced last week that the proposals ndash which will be split into two phases after evidence of protected species was found at the site ndash were taking shape.The first phase will see the restoration of the doocot, the installation of new architectural lighting and the installation of new interpretation information boards, which will be developed in collaboration with the local community.The project, which is expected to cost up to pound,, is being supported by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Town Centre Fund and progressed by East Lothian Council in collaboration with building owners the National Trust for Scotland and with the support of the Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership and the National Lottery-funded Great Place Project.A project manager from building surveyors Doig and Smith has been brought on board to lead the project team, as well as project consultant Groves Raines Architects.The first phase of works could get under way this summer ndash subject to ecological advice ndash with the second phase to feature work to the tower itself ndash such as repairs to walls.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, was pleased to see the scheme moving forward.He said: ldquoWersquore pleased that the project team is making good progress with this project to enhance a much-loved local landmark.ldquoThe tower and nearby doocot have been in need of repair work for some time, with improvements required to ious walls.ldquoThe focus is to enable safe access inside parts of the buildings, whilst also improving the interpretation and understanding of the buildings to help shine a light on their local and national signicance.ldquoThere are also aspirations to link the site with others in the area as part of a wider heritage network.ldquoItrsquos all about maximising the potential of the site and Irsquom sure this will be a great benefit to the local community.ldquoThe likely presence of protected species and their habitats at the site means the work needs to be programmed in such a way that they are not disturbed.Phil Long OBE, The National Trust for Scotlandrsquos chief executive, highlighted the historic signicance of the building.He said: ldquoPreston Tower lies quietly now but has played a part in our national story for many centuries, torched as part of the Rough Wooing by the forces of Henry VIII, again by Oliver Cromwell in , and sketched by Turner on one of several of his expeditions to Scotland in the early th century.ldquoAnd so itrsquos exciting that, through the work of this partnership, the tower is receiving new attention, conserved and cared for, and provided with information to help understanding of its remarkable story.ldquoIrsquom very grateful indeed to the Scottish Government, East Lothian Council, Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership and local community and the National Lottery for their support in making this possible.The Preston Tower project is one of three planned heritage-led projects in Prestonpans, the others being major investment at Prestongrange Museum to build a new engine shed and the re-landscaping of the war memorial square."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-home-year-shows-cottages-transformation","story":"Hannah and John Biddulph bought the three cottages, on the western end of the villagersquos High Street, in  and moved in after six months of extensive renovations, which saw the three homes turned into one for themselves and son Samson, now seven.Hannah, who works as fundraising and marketing manager for social enterprise Heavy Sound and also runs their holiday cottage, Boatshore by the Sea, next door, entered their home into the TV showrsquos contest as a fan of the format.She said: ldquoIrsquom addicted to anything remotely like Homes Under The Hammer, property development shows, anything like that.

Some SNP Government policiesre-elected are:Our future is in our hands on May .Stevie Curran THE way in which our growing authorities are funded is extremely unfair.When compared to other councils, East Lothian and Midlothianare disadvantaged, as Scottish Government-allocated funds are failing to recognise and keep pace with our growth.Council tax income forms approximately  per cent of the entire council budget the remainder is allocated by Scottish Government.Our councils face huge challenges in meeting the growing demand for services, yet the funding model fails to take full account of our growth.It really is an insult when you consider our commitment to meet Scottish Government housebuilding demands.The Scottish Government are refusing to reciprocate that commitment and responsibility, with investment for local services and for transport infrastructureto support the growth demands they place on us.This is an unsustainable position.My support for Scottish Government housebuilding targets is not unconditional, and I say that as the cabinet member with responsibility for housing in Midlothian.In respect of Sherfhall Roundabout, the following is an extract from a  SESplan report: ldquoThe Edinburgh and the Lothians Structure Plan  and the Regional Transport Strategy identy the grade separation of Sherfhall roundabout as a key infrastructure project essential for the delivery of the development strategy. The continuing lack of Scottish Government commitment to grade separation at Sherfhall will impact inevitably on the ability of Midlothian, East Lothian, south-east Edinburgh and central Scottish Borders to contribute fully to the drive for Scotlandrsquos economic recovery.The gross underfunding of the , hours early learning and childcare implementation was highlighted at a meeting of the Public Audit and Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee at Holyrood.Absurdly, Scottish Ministers took the decision to allocate funding on the basis of the  population figures.This is one of the most blatant injustices and attacks on equality that Irsquove witnessed in local government.Once again, no meaningful interventions from our current MSP.I will continue to campaign for fairer funding for our councils.My constituents will always be my priority.Charles Dundas THIS week, health and wellbeing issues have been a major feature of my campaign.The last year has demonstrated just how valuable the work of healthcare professionals has been to our society, but Irsquom afraid that the problems I keep hearing about locally tend to be centred on how dficult it can be to access some services.East Lothian patients were aghast back in December when the Scottish Government abandoned the plan to develop a new Edinburgh Eye Hospital at the Royal Infirmary in Little France, and instead have them travel theof the Lothians to St Johnrsquos in Livingston.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats listened to these concerns, and during the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget last month we were able to secure a review of the decision ndash a potential leline for central access to specialist eye services in the Lothians.Irsquove also been contacted by the local campaigners concerned by the dficulties that the Riverside Medical Practice are experiencing getting staff in place to be able to serve the people of Musselburgh.I was very impressed by how organised they are no one  has asked me to make my first question in Parliament about their issue.So I have pledged thatelected, my first question in Holyrood will be to the Health Secretary, or the First Minister, about the national obstacles to local healthcare provision.For too long, vulnerable people have had to endure harrowingly long waits for mental health treatment in Scotland.There is no issue as important to the Liberal Democrats as this.On day one after the election, we will implement our new mental health recovery plan and train more mental health counsellors, bringing them into NHS workforce planning processes.As Scotland begins to reopen, we desperately need to put the recovery first and invest in health services.Mental health must be taken as seriously as physical health in the next Parliament and I promise to do just that.Iain Whyte AS I HAVE been out and about campaigning this week, I have been contacted by a number of people who have concerns over access to GP services.As the Courier has reported, this is a major issue at Riverside Medical Practice but is also affecting others across the constituency.I am extremely concerned that Musselburghrsquos housing and population have been allowed to expand so much in recent years without increasing the GP provision to cope.This had led to some patients describing the feeling that they are without a GP service because they simply cannot get an appointment.I fully understand everything the Riverside practice are doing to recruit extra staff but I donrsquot believe this is enough on its own.What is needed is that we train more doctors in Scotland for the future and that we attempt to attract more to live and work here now.After  years in charge, we can see that the SNP Scottish Governmentrsquos decisions to cap doctor training numbers at universities has had a negative impact when we have a growing and ageing population.We Scottish Conservatives have committed to an lsquoNHS escalatorrsquo, which would increase the annual budget for the NHS in Scotland by pound billion over the course of the next Parliament.This would give NHS Lothian long-term security and allow them to protect local services in the future ndash especially as NHS Lothian is underfunded compared with other areas of Scotland based on the Governmentrsquos own formula of need.I agree with the local campaigners who have started a petition to ask the Health Minister to intervene to improve GP services in Musselburgh.I am also happy to commit to make this the topic of my first Parliamentary questionelected.In the meantime, I am happy to raise talk to the practice about their plans but the long-term needs are obvious: more GPs in Musselburgh and across the constituency.This issue has been ignored for too long and itrsquos time the health board and the Scottish Government stepped up to help."},{"url":null,"title":"david-berry-column-county-took-golf-global","story":"Our  courses include the oldest continuously played course in the world at

We can eat them by the shore of the loch.They drove a short distance along the tree-lined road that follows the northern shore of Loch Earn. At times it seemed asthey were driving through thick forest, the trees arching over the road making a tunnel of branches and leaves, made vivid green by the bright sunshine that seeped through the canopy. The meaning of the lochrsquos name seems lost in time, but some say its origin is loch of the Irish.: Tims Tales, chapter oneThey had their lunch on a stony beach. Izzy performed her now-familiar ritual of boiling water for her coffee on her stove. Few words were exchanged as they ate. Izzy sat on a small boulder scanning the shore opposite. She tried to identy the place where the temporary grave of James Stewart of Ardvorlich was, a tale she hadnrsquot told Finn. Then she looked to the far western part of the loch to seethe island which had once been the stronghold of the Neish clan was visible. She wasnrsquot sureshe could see it in the heat haze. That would be a tale she would tell Finn later.Then she looked east towards the southern shore for a distant view of Edinample Castle, where tradition says the notorious Campbell chief named lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo threw an architect from the battlements. He had the castle built after displacing the MacGregors from the land. She told Finn the tale, and that the ghost of the architect is said to haunt the castle. He wanted to visit but she explained it was a private residence.ldquoSo not fair that some folks get to live in a castle! Finn complained. Izzy could only agree.Finn wanted to sunbathe for a while, so they lay like slumbering seals. Izzy closed her eyes, face up to the sun. It was now really hot. Soon shersquod had enough and sat up, took off her shoes and socks, rolled up her trouser legs and headed for the water.Finn looked up and quickly joined her. They both stood, knee deep in the cooling waters of the loch, splashing themselves. Then they picked up stones from the lochrsquos bed and threw them. ldquoHaving a competition, just like the giants, Finn remarked.: Tims Tales, chapter twoThen he noticed that his aunt had a tattoo on the lower part of her left leg.ldquoI didnrsquot know you had a tattoo, what is it  he asked.She lted her leg out the water for a moment.ldquoCool, is it a dolphin  asked Finn.ldquoItrsquos a Pictish symbol, copied from one of their carvings on a standing stone. Itrsquos called the water beast but I think itrsquos a kelpie. Maybe even an ancient image of what people now call Nessie.ldquoNessie is a kelpie! exclaimed Finn. ldquoCan you tell me that story ldquoI will when we get there, promise.Finn was impatient, but he knew his aunt would keep her word.ldquoSo why would you want a kelpie as a tattoo : Tims Tales, chapter threeldquoWell, I like the design, but also I suppose because itrsquos part of the ancient culture of our land ancestors.They walked back to the beach and sat with their legs sprawled out to dry their feet and legs in the sun.Finn was still curious as to why his aunt would want such a fearsome creature as a tattoo.ldquoI believe we are all born with a kelpie within us, she said, ldquoit can stay harmlesswe know how to keep it that way, but it can grow and become an uncontrollable monsterwe feed it the wrong things.ldquoYou mean like junk food  asked Finn quizzically.: Tims Tales, chapter fourldquoYeah, kind of, but the kelpie inside us feeds on emotions, so itrsquos junk food is emotions like hatred, jealousy, spite.ldquoSo whatrsquos its healthy food, then  wondered Finn.ldquoWhat do you think ldquoDunno, he said, then thought for a moment. ldquoLove, kindness, stuff like that.ldquoDefinitely, said Izzy. She continued: ldquoThere is even a story about a kelpie who is changed by love. He falls in love with a woman, and she with him. The Kelpie lived in Loch Garve, much further north from here. They got married and lived together at the bottom of the loch.ldquoSounds like a copy of Beauty and the Beast, said Finn.: Tims Tales, chapter fiveldquoYeah, it is a bit, except they both loved each other for who they really were. But there was one thing that made the kelpiersquos we unhappy: she was constantly cold living in the loch.ldquoObviously! said Finn.ldquoWell, the kelpie loved her and wanted to make her comfortable, so he captured a stonemason and made a deal with him. Infor his le, the stonemason had to agree to make a fireplace and chimney.ldquoWait a minute, a fire under the water ldquoYep.ldquoBut thatrsquos impossible!Izzy raised her eyebrows and gave Finn a grin.ldquoAnything is possible in a story, she said. ldquoSo the stonemason had no choice. He built the fireplace and chimney, and the kelpie made the fire. The mason was set free, and in thanks the kelpie ensured he always had a plentul supply of fish.ldquoSo just how did the kelpie make an underwater fire then Izzy shrugged her shoulders. ldquoDonrsquot know, but love can help you make the impossible possible. The we was no longer cold and they lived happily together. Every evening they sat cosily by their blazing hearth. Thatrsquos why therersquos a part of Loch Garve that never freezes, even in the coldest winters.Finn laughed at the image.Izzy rolled her trouser legs back down and stood up.ldquoLetrsquos go, she said.ldquoWhere to now ldquoKillin, itrsquos a lovely village. Some folk say its name comes from the Gaelic Cill Fhinn, which means the chapel of Finn or Fingal. Fingal was another name for Fionn MacCoul. We are going to visit Fingalrsquos Stone, which is said to be the burial place of Fionn himself!: Tims Tales, chapter sixldquoIrsquom a coming! said Finn excitedly, putting his socks and shoes on.Izzy glanced at the two old thatched houses at the foot of Glen Ogle as she drove up the steep glen. She had memories of them from her childhood, and every time she passed the old houses they seemed slightly more dilapidated. Izzy felt their deterioration and neglect symbolised so much of the story of the Highlands.As old Bess climbed up the road towards the pass, Izzy could see in her mindrsquos eye the trains running across the dramatic viaduct which formed part of the old railway line which cut through the hillside on the western slope. Now trackless, she had distant memories of seeing it in use from her early childhood before the rockfall which closed it prematurely. Those days travelling with her parents in their Morris Minor car had given her that first taste of awe at Highland landscape that had remained with her ever since. Her love for the Highlands was rooted in her fondest memories of her father, who had a passion for them.Below the modern road, on the floor of the glen, faint traces of the th-century military road meander up towards the pass at the top of the glen. Izzy had always felt that the Glen Ogle was overlooked a place where people usually passed through on the way to somewhere . Its ghosts were marching Redcoats and driven cattle on the hoof.So she always stoppedsafely possible to give the glen its place, evenfor only a brief moment of appreciation. She pulled into a layby near the top of the glen. Finn had no idea of the view that had been hiding behind him and was taken by surprise as he got out the car. He wanted to take a photo of the glen and looked for his camera. Finn was feeling it, Izzy thought to herself: that spark of awe that the landscape lights in your soul.Ten minutes later, they arrived at Killin. The first introduction to the Falls of Dochart, which can roar through the village after days of rain, can be a spectacular surprise. Izzy gave Finn no advance warning and when the rapids suddenly appeared, Finn called out: ldquoCan we stop, can we stop!: Tims Tales, chapter sevenShe pulled in and Finn was out of the car before she put the handbrake on. He stood on a rocky ledge watching and listening to the water as it raged over the rocks, its brown peaty water turning white at the fringes as it crashed its way towards the old bridge. Finn leapt between the rocks, taking himself into the middle of the rapids. Izzy held her breath, terried hersquod slip, but reluctant to restrain his joy.ldquoBe careful, Finn, she shouted out, but of course he couldnrsquot hear her. He stood, mesmerised in the midst of the torrent. Izzy sat on the wall and watched anxiously as he tried to reach a young Scots pine growing impossibly from a rock. Eventually he ed, much to Izzyrsquos relief. His boots were wet but his feet dry and his face glowing.ldquoWhat an amazing place! he said.They walked over the bridge, past Innis Bhuidhe, the ancient burial ground of the MacNabs, and the folklore centre, both of which she planned to show Finn later. Then a short walk behind the school and they were there: Fingalrsquos Stone, the resting place of the legendary Fingal, otherwise named Fionn MacCoul.Finnrsquos initial excitement turned to disappointment that the stone itself wasnrsquot more impressive.

It told a familiar story.Yes, Scotland does better than other areas of the UK, London apart. However, we have problems with our birth rate, both in terms of population and business start-ups.Further, those businesses which do get going tend not to grow rapidly or signicantly. Our productivity is a concern: we need to ersy our economy, not least in the North Sea where oil and gas are declining assets.:Sturgeon versus Salmond. Here are the game plans for the socially distanced electionDo I see the mammoth twitch its ears at these comments  Perhaps, like the canine world, it is alert to the high-pitched whistles which customarily sound at such points.Dog whistle one, directed at supporters of opposition parties. It is all the fault of the incumbent Scottish or UK governments. If only they would adopt our policies.Up to a point, Lord Copper. Underlying economic problems in Scotland predate the present administrations. Indeed, they predate devolution.Dog whistle two, aimed at supporters of independence. The problems rest solely with the Union. Political independence would liberate our economy, permitting us to match the performance of our Nordic chums.The Oxford Economics report does say that some of the remedies to the problems they diagnose rest with UK action, notably on taxation. Further, they argue that Brexit has made the situation worse.However, they add that devolved Scotland needs to pay more heed ndash and cash ndash to the issue of economic development, while removing obstacles to growth.Perhaps we might consider that the solution need not lie solely with constitutional change. Supporters of independence do not have to take my word for that: they can read chapter and verse in another report, this one produced for the SNP.In , the partyrsquos Growth Commission, chaired by Andrew Wilson, produced a y and thoughtful study.Mr Wilson noted then that independence was no ldquomagic wand: that there was a need to be ldquocandid about the challenges, in addition to optimistic about the opportunities. He said hope must conquer fear but must also be ldquogrounded in clear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.This largely presaged the diagnosis set out in this weekrsquos Oxford Economics study but went on to generate a composite cure of its own making, focused upon the need to grow GDP through ldquoproductivity, population and participation.Tell me this. Are you hearing much in this election with regard to the economy which is either clear-sighted or rigorous  Are you hearing much in the way of detailed discourse at all Are you hearing instead voluble,inevitably inconclusive, argument about the date of the next independence referendum  From both sides of that debate.In the corner of the election room, the rough beast shakes its head, slowly and ponderously.When we hear such unalloyed promises, pests like me tend to ask ldquowhere is the money coming from  Such was always my habit and I am revisiting it in a podcast series being prepared for The Herald.From experience, replies y but, mostly, they range from unspecied growth to ldquoefficiency savings . If pressed, my interlocutors may argue that ldquowe cannot afford NOT to spend this money.:Independence and the SNP mdash The dream that hesitates to speak its nameIncidentally, they will always talk of ldquoinvestment, rather than ldquospending. Somehow, that irks me. I know, I know, pitiably petty, but there it is.Look, I get the concept. I know the notion is that we are investing in future generations. I applaud that endeavour. But let us not fool ourselves. Politicians talk of investment, rather than cash, because they know it is a comforting euphemism for the taxpayers.There is another element to this debate. This weekrsquos report presumes that we want to grow GDP, that it is an agreed objective,the methods remain disputed. But is that entirely true The Greens, for example, question the value of Gross Domestic Product as a touchstone. Nicola Sturgeon, too, has advanced the concept that we might need a dferent set of values, encompassing human well-being rather than financial growth.Again, I applaud this endeavour. It is right and proper to examine the basis upon which we found our polity.However, as Ms Sturgeon and others have recognised, we need to do more than to restate our objective as well-being. We need to define that objective itself and to specy policies which might generate advancement in pursuit of that aim.Otherwise, we risk substituting a warm glow for rigorous governmental policy, precisely as Andrew Wilson warned in his  report. We risk copying Voltairersquos Pangloss and believing that we can all too easily create a situation in which ldquoall is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.Again, to some extent, we are collectively culpable of pushing our politicians in a Panglossian direction.

Itrsquos all too easy though, and comes risk-free. It demands little in the way of originality and much in callousness: somewhere an old woman is mourning the loss of a man who had been her le companion for the last  years. Sympathy costs nothing and enhances us vindictiveness reduces us.Angela Haggerty, the left-wing media commentator who springs from a working-class tradition, encapsulated this best when she tweeted: ldquoHaving lost my Dad in June and watching him become so frail, my emotional instinct at the death of Prince Philip is to feel sad for his family. Having a political view on the role of monarchy doesnrsquot require you to sacrice your personal humanity. Donrsquot let folk pressure you.Read more:Scotlandrsquos dismal political class have nothing to say to the poor or the youngYet, there was something manufactured and contrived in the reaction of the British establishment to the announcement of Philiprsquos death. Irsquom not surethere is a template somewhere that dictates the protocols for greeting the death of a long-standing prince consort. If such a concordat exists it surely didnrsquot envisage what we have witnessed over the two days.Itrsquos been reported that the Duke of Edinburgh didnrsquot want too much of a fuss to be made of his death and this seems to have been of a piece with his general approach to le. So, itrsquos probably safe to assume he would have greeted whatrsquos followed it with that grimace perfected by the male royals whenever they encounter something avid . Thus, an event that called for quiet and proportionate dignity was turned into something brash and braying. And the death of an old man became less of a tribute to whatever personal qualities he possessed than an opportunity to convey triumphalism.In recent years we have seen something of this in the way that the poppy, once a universal symbol of humble sacrice, has been distorted into a vampiric caricature. The weeks prior to November  now ring to the cries of poppy vigilantes hunting down those not deemed to be sufficiently enthusiastic about wearing this little red emblem of hope.Our publicly-funded broadcaster became BBC Windsor as it made a graven image of this man who, though essentially decent probably didnrsquot achieve much more than many otherstheyrsquod had access to the resources and personnel of the statersquos largesse. Their simpering coverage actually insulted those qualities they were eager to associate with him: dignity duty selflessness and a desire to make a quiet contribution.It was also tone deaf to the losses borne by , of us who have seen loved ones perish as coronavirus has moved through the land. The BBC has been an exemplar of fine public broadcasting in the way itrsquos conveyed the quiet dignity of many ordinary families who have endured grief in this pandemic. Many harbour a measure of affection for the royal family and the stability and fortitude they believe this institution still represents. I suspect though, that many too will be among the thousands who have registered complaints about the BBCrsquos gross lapse in editorial judgment.Read more:The British elite has failed utterly. Its time for Scotland to break freeThroughout the course of Saturday BBC presenters were made to wear black as a procession of plummy-voiced, public school Astors filed in to recreate what s deference sounded like. Here was the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby describing Prince Philip as ldquoa prophet. And over there a chaise longue of Tatler socialites describing him asa David Attenborough prototype an icon of religious unity and a pioneer of feminism: this for not making a fuss and stamping his feet at being made to walk two paces behind the Queen.The old fella, doubtless stf with boredom, simply did what most of the rest of us would have chosen to do ndash given the resources ndash at the prospect of a le consorting with myriad Trumpington-Llewellins and Sharpington-Dinsdales: he developed a rapid interest in exotic animals and wild places hellip the remoter the better. He wasnrsquot looking for medals, though.But medals are what he got from the BBC and an assortment of establishment lickspittles. By the time his funeral comes along on Saturday I fully expect a couple of miracles to be ascribed to his heavenly intervention and archbishop Welby to be naming a book of common prayer in his honour.You suspect though, that much of this stemmed from something more than the establishment getting carried away in a fugue of royalist fervour in readiness for the end of lockdown. They have made golden calves of these dysal German aristocrats, not because they hold them in anything approaching genuine admiration, but because their very existence sancties and reinforces the class system that underpins English society. In normalising this with daily obeisance to the House of Windsor it becomes embedded in the collective consciousness of those who, in other countries, would consider such an arrangement bizarre and unacceptable.In these countries they treat their royal families as mere state ambassadors who get to wear ceremonial dress occasionally as long as they donrsquot get too many ideas above their conferred status. In the UK they have been made into something much more insidious: the casual rendering of inequality and unearned privilege into something benign.This is what has been going on these last few days. At a human level though, it merely made a ridiculous spectacle of a man who, knowing hersquod married into privilege, seemed to have spent his days trying to use his advantages to spread a little decency: nothing more nothing less.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The city now wants to create a people-friendly, green, healthy, thriving environment which welcomes all for a stay, work, to invest in or live. The new vision sees a city centre \"transformed with mini parks ... creating more greenspace in the heart of Glasgow\" . The councilrsquos innovative Green Covid Recovery budget includes \"an improvement fund for local parks and green spaces\" and \"outdoor play for children\", according to the Glasgow City Council website. That sounds great so where to start Fortunately there is an ideal site left over from the old Glasgow Comprehensive Redevelopment Programme of  or  years ago. After wreaking havoc on the citys built environment one plot on Ingram Street remains vacant. A stand of mature trees gives the basis for a green oasis in the city centre. It also has a grand, much admired, mural on the Old Fruit Market wall featuring local nature. Currently the site is used for leaving motor vehicles.After an inappropriate hotel plan was withdrawn in , the local Merchant City and Trongate Community Council reimagined the area as a rare open space and park for locals and visitors alike. An action group tested local and visitor support, which proved overwhelmingly in favour. So they set about using the encouraging Community EmpowermentAct  to achieve this. A business plan was produced with provisional design layout and visuals.Glasgow City Councilthen made it dficult for this potential to be realised. Halfway through the process GCC, unannounced, sold its asset to their own arms- City Property , which isnt subject to the legislation. CPGI has now sold the land, subject to planning permission, to the developer of the high rise surrounding the old Customs House by the Clyde.Vigorous objection will undoubtedly follow any proposal for a block of flats and retail at this historic conservation area site. Large developments nearby for Candleriggs and King Street will supply residential accommodation and more shops. Businesses already benefit from the open, green aspect. Loss of the trees, mural and breathing space to an overshadowing structure would be tragic. Alternatively adding trees, using the secured Woodland Trust funds , plus a pop-up event space, would attract families, visitors and more tourists to this vibrant hospitality and entertainment quarter.Studies keep highlighting how greening the city improves health and wellbeing, pollution control and climate resilience. Artworks, too, lt the spirit.

Losing a parent is hard enough without having to face the cameras to express your grief. What was striking, however, was that not so very long ago, Charles, at , would have been seen as not merely old, but comfortably past his sell-by date.

In an era of universal health care, reaching a ripe old age is no longer a cast-iron indicator of class or income, although sadly these do continue to play a role.More signicant is the general health of the population. In , when the law providing for the first state pension was passed, average le expectancy in the UK was  for men,  for women. By that standard the Duke of Edinburgh enjoyed more than twice the Edwardian norm. Today, those figures are in the region of  and , or  overall, although as everyone is all too aware, people in deprived postcodes die far younger than the statistics suggest. For some households, and indeed entire communities, for a senior member to live almost a century remains the stuff of science fiction.Increasingly, though, children reach middle age with at least one parent around. They are often drawing their pension before they gain the unwelcome distinction of reaching what you might call the family front line. It is a slightly disconcerting thought. In the space of less than a century, the once fixed pattern of generational transition has been expanded, almost beyond recognition. Where children formerly were luckythey were born in time to meet their grandparents ndash my fatherrsquos father died a decade before I was born ndash now it is commonplace for obituaries to include not just a list of the deceasedrsquos children and grandchildren but of great-grandchildren too.With their mother or father living well into their s and s, those who are otherwise independent adults, with families of their own, still also remain in some sense children. Or, to put it the other way, the role of parents has for some become a -year long-haul journey rather than a -year sprint.Nobody now blinks when youngsters continue to live at home well into their twenties or thirties, leaving and ing like migrating wildebeest as relationships, careers and accommodation needs fluctuate. Yet a mere half a century ago, it was assumed that a child would be financially free-standing after they left school or further education and found a job. If they still lived at home, then a nominal rent would usually be expected. It was not just a question of the household budget unable to accommodate additional grown-ups who did not pay their way. Parent-child boundaries were governed by a firm and even rigid idea of what was appropriate and respectful. Modern mums or dads who suffer empty nest syndrome when the last child heads out the door might be shocked to learn that their own parents breathed a sigh of relief when their brood fled the coop and they finally got their lives back.In virtually all respects longevity is a win-win for every family member. Children often donrsquot properly know or indeed appreciate their parents until they have grown older and wiser. The same is true in reverse. Once your kids are raised and established, it is possible to have a dferent kind of rapport with them. Offering economic help can play a part, but the defining feature of modern parenting is emotional support and involvement. Occasionally this can go too far, to the detriment of youngsters finding their own feet, or of parents not learning to press the release button. Yet excessive interest or interference is, arguably, less damaging than too little attention.And in time, roles inevitably reverse. As they grow frail, elderly relatives are no longer taken into childrenrsquos homes to live out their final days, as was once the case. My Linlithgow grandmother recalled the terror the poorhouse held when she was a child. It was the last resort for the senile and indigent who had nobody to look after them. These days, the care home has replaced it for dread. Yet the ongoing attention given to parents by their family as they start to decline is part of the leblood of society. At one end of the spectrum there are grandparents helping with child care, at the other silver-haired retirees acting as s and carers for their mum or dad.The big dference today is that when what Dickens called the Aged P does depart, their children are not so far from the exit either. In losing somebody who has been in their le for upwards of eighty or ninety years, they are saying goodbye to part of themselves. I was startled recently when a friend in her sixties, whose father had died some years earlier, described herself as orphaned on her motherrsquos death.

Education is an art and conducted in artful manner, to invigorate and develop the minds of the young, brings rewards that last a letime.In Scotland we are advised, \"do not mix religion and politics\".

She grew up in a big house with servants in Cha and might have been expected to become a Tory indeed, when she first started campaigning for Labour, she was accused of being a traitor to her class. However, her father, George Catlin, was a Labour candidate and pushed her to party meetings in her pram, and her mother, Vera Brittain, wrote about the pain and pointlessness of war in her memoir Testament of Youth. For Shirley, it was a kindergarten of radicalism and compassion.But she was never really a socialist. She was a radical liberal. She was a social democrat and an internationalist. She was pro-European, anti-nationalist and anti-authoritarian and she was uncomfortable with the extremities of both the Left and the Right. At one end was the big-state socialism of Michael Foot and at the other end the free-market conservatismof Tony Blair and in the middle was Shirley. She was in the centre. She was a centrist.We know now, of course, that the centre got squeezed when Mrs Thatcherrsquos fortunes recovered after the Falklands War, and the search for the middle ground goes on. In writing the obituary for Williams, I read some of her speeches and her guiding principles were clear: social liberalism, internationalism, a desire for equality, and concern about the authoritarianism of the rightand the authoritarianism of the left .Looking back, you can see that Williams was a voice of common sense in the middle of it all, but her death raises the question of why there is still no obvious home for people who agree with her, particularly in Scotland. For a long time, there was a tradition of radical, passionate liberalism in the Highlands and, in the cities, voters gathered round the party of Keir Hardie there was also a vein of lower-case conservatism in the Borders and Aberdeenshire. But all of it, pretty much, circled round the same point: the liberal centre.So where has Scotlandrsquos centre gone  Many voters may feel it lies somewhere, deep down, in the bosom of the SNP but their record in government tells a dferent story. Where are the radical, or even effective, policies aimed at reducing inequality  Policies like the introduction of comprehensive schools in the s, which Shirley Williams helped steer through. Therersquos also an unpleasant authoritarian streak in the SNP that Williams would surely hate: the ldquonamed person proposals, for example, or the Hate Crime Bill.Ordinarily, voters who think like Shirley might find their home in some of the smaller parties andyou look at the policies of the Scottish Greens, therersquos much for liberals to like: more powers for councils, an end to fox hunting, and an end to the so-called ldquowar on drugs. The same applies to the Lib-Dems and particularly Labour under its new leader Anas Sarwar, who speaks the kind of language Shirley would applaud: compassionate, internationalist, liberal.But sadly the centre has been squeezed again. In the s, it was squeezed between Thatcherism and socialism and in Scotland in , itrsquos being squeezed between nationalism and unionism. Vote for the Scottish Greens and get nationalism. Vote for the SNP and get nationalism. Vote for the Lib-Dems in a seat thatrsquos going to be won by either the SNP or the Tories and get nationalism. Radical, internationalist liberals have no home. Who on earth do they vote for  Where on earth is the centre Forty years ago, Shirley Williams thought, or hoped, she had found the answer in the SDP. She was wrong, but perhaps there is some hope to be found in how her story ended. The SDP imploded, but its creation was the first chapter in the story of a dferent centreground: New Labour. The brand may be tainted, but the hope must be that something similar could happen in Scotland. Political extremes burn intensely, but they donrsquot burn for long. Perhaps the centreground in Scotland will grow. Perhaps, some day, it will re-emerge.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

I am old enough, sadly, to have been alive when the betrothal of the Prince was announced and the general public reaction was ldquoPrince whohellip. Far from giving up a \"glittering naval career\" to walk three steps behind Princess Elizabeth, Philip grabbed the opportunity to be catapulted from total anonymity into the centre of the wealthiest, most influential royal European family of the time and siring generations of kings. From being a stateless, penniless, rootless minor royal he then enjoyed a letime of unadulterated opulence, luxury and deference.True he had a chaotic, dysal, at times loveless, childhood with a mother who had serious mental health issues and a distant playboy father who didnrsquot let his lack of money affect his lavish lestyle in the South of France with his mistress. Good training, I would have thought, for joining the British royal family.The only fly in the ointment for Philip was his fury at being denied passing on his surname to his children.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3734525.jpg--.jpg?1617873435000\n","title":"the ballymena man who designed the titanic","story":"TITANIC - the very mention of the name is enough to send a shudder down the spine. The scale of the  disaster still resonates to this day and, not surprisingly, we in Northern Ireland remain particularly intrigued by the tragic story. After all, the near legendary ‘unsinkable ship’ was built on the slipways and docks of Harland and Wolff.We have flocked to see several epic movies about the disaster and watched fascinated as deep sea submersibles have traversed the wreck of the ship.Who can forget the elaborate chandelier apearing out of the murk when the first cameras were sent into the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic.But only a small number of local people will be aware that Alexander Carlisle who led the initial design team for the project was from Ballymena.With the help of a few sources we hope to make the link between the City of the Seven Towers and the most famous ship in history.Perhaps the best article on Carlisle’s role has been penned by Paul Louden-Brown FRSA for the Titanic Belfast website. And he begins his exploration by asking why so many people have credited the much more famous Thomas Andrews, played by Victor Garber in the enormously successful  movie, with the design. Louden-Brown argues that Thomas Andrews did not design Titanic or her sister ships Olympic and Britannic.He states, unequivicolly that the man who deserves credit for the design is Alexander Carlisle.He writes: “So why, when so much is written and talked about Titanic, has such a mistake been made  The answer lies partly in the power of film.“In  Walter Lord’s best seller ‘A Night to Remember’ about the Titanic disaster was turned into a feature film.“The film’s screenplay, outside of the author’s control, featured a degree of dramatic license in order to increase the impact of the story.“ The first of these dramatizations was the launch of Titanic - the White Star Line held no formal naming ceremony for their steamships and Titanic was no exception - yet in the film a lady names the vessel and breaks a bottle of champagne over the bows.“I asked Bill MacQuitty, the Belfast-born producer of the film, who, as a child, witnessed the launch of Titanic, why he included an invented scene in his film “His answer was revealing ‘because it’s what an audience expects to see at the launch of a ship.’ The same, he said, applied to Thomas Andrews’ characterization.“The idea of the designer of the ship going down with his creation, while the owner escaped in a leboat, was too good a storyline to ignore.”Louden Brown continues: “MacQuitty was well aware who really designed Titanic and that J. Bruce Ismay was not a coward but his primary concern was turning an historical event into a commercially successful feature film.“ In that respect he succeeded and ‘A Night to Remember’ remains the definitive version with Titanic enthusiasts and the public alike.“The film’s influence is clear to see. James Cameron’s blockbuster film ‘Titanic’ also re-enforced Andrews’ position as ‘designer’ in a similar caricaturization to that used by MacQuitty almost forty years before.”Countless books, magazine articles, TV documentaries and even a set of th anniversary stamps featuring an image of Andrews all reinforce the misconception that he designed the ship - the invented story is just too powerful.Louden Brown continues: “None of this uncomfortable truth is intended to take anything away from the reputation of Thomas Andrews he was a brave man and did his duty.“He died helping others and his name is properly honoured in the country of his birth but he does not deserve credit for designing the ‘Olympic’ class liners that honour belongs to Carlisle.“The man who designed Titanic was born in Ballymena, Co. Antrim on  July . Alexander Montgomery Carlisle, eldest of five children and the son of John Carlisle, Headmaster of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, was educated at his father’s school.In , aged sixteen, he began work at Harland  Wolff as a premium apprentice. Serving alongside him for the next five years was his friend, fellow apprentice and future brother-in-law William James Pirrie . The two young men were destined to play a leading role in the development of Harland  Wolff.In April  Carlisle married American born Edith Wooster, twelve years his junior, at the First Congregational Church in San Francisco.The couple had two daughters and a son and, as Carlisle was steadily promoted, the family purchased a large red brick house in Elmwood Avenue near Queen’s University.In  Carlisle was made chief naval architect at the yard and from this date he designed some of most famous liners belonging to the White Star Line amongst the long list were Teutonic, Cymric, Oceanic, Adriatic and finally the ‘Olympic’ class liners.As Manager his redevelopment plan of the yard in order to facilitate the construction of the world’s largest liners transformed Harland  Wolff into a virtual factory production line.At the end of June  he resigned from the positions of General Manager and Chairman of Managing Directors at the relatively young age of fty-five - the reason for his decision to resign are unknown. Remarkably he had never taken a day’s sick leave since joining the firm.Universally popular with the workforce, who nicknamed him ‘Big Alec’, the growing issue of Home Rule and the political instability of the period may have contributed towards his decision to leave. At the time of his retirement Carlisle split his time between his homes in Belfast and  Hyde Park Place, Londonsup.His designs for the ‘Olympic’ class were completed with both vessels under construction Olympic plated and just four months away from launching and Titanic in frame.Thomas Andrews’ involvement, from July onwards, was to take up where Carlisle had left off in the management of a project where the major designs decisions had been completed several years before.Continued from page : Louden-Brown ‘s article continues: The disaster which overtook Carlisle’s last creation was said to have broken his heart.Called to give evidence at the British enquiry into the loss and asked about his role in the design of Titanic, he explained that he was in charge of turning the concept for the ‘Olympic’ class into design reality.Both ships, he said, were ‘entirely designed practically by Lord Pirrie. The details, the decorations, the equipment and the general arrangements all came under me.’Carlisle was being modest about his influence and abilities. His ‘signature style’ for the White Star fleet was well established by the s the proportions of the hull to the upper works, rake of the funnels, spacing of the masts, design of the bridge front and more, gave each vessel an unmistakable and identiable White Star look.Lord Pirrie’s opinions on the design, or otherwise, were not sought by Lord Mersey and it remains a signicant oversight that he was not called to give evidence, or asked to provide even a written statement, particularly with regard to the decision made regarding the number of leboats provided on each ship.Carlisle placed blame for the lack of leboats with the White Star management.It was Carlisle who outlined the design of what became the Welin Quadrant Davit system, capable of handling up to twice the number of leboatsthe Board of Trade regulations required, but the owners made the decision to reduce this number to just  with four collapsibles.The famous shipbuilder always followed his own inclinations having scant respect for convention.In February  he was arrested on a Coroner’s warrant for failing to attend the inquest into the death of a workman killed in the yard. On promising to attend the adjourned inquest he was released.He was made an Irish Privy Councillor by King Edward in . Like Pirrie, Carlisle became a Home Ruler - campaigning for an indpendent Irish Parliament within the Imperial context.Carlisle, a keen collector of autographs, counted amongst his collection many prominent personalties including those of King George and Kaiser Wilhelm.He met the Kaiser on a number of occasions before the First World War. His eldest daughter married Baron Frederick von Versen, one of the Kaiser’s aides, and in  when visiting the married couple in Berlin he was entertained by the Kaiser.The two men were formally introduced at the unveiling of Queen Victoria’s memorial in front of Buckingham Palace in  and they met again when he was a guest at a famous supper party after one of the Kiel yachting regattas.A noted Germanophile, the Ulsterman was certainly impressed with all things Germanic and made several Atlantic crossings in the liners Amerika, Kaiserin Auguste Victoria and Imperatorit appears his tastes were better satisfied by the lavish surroundings in the German liners.Long after the war, anti-German sentiment still prevailed in Britain but it did not bother him.It was rumoured that a rt existed between Carlisle and his brother-in-law Lord Pirrie, but no reason has been offered as to why this should have been the case. The most plausible explanation was Carlisle’s Bohemian tastes, his close ties with the Kaiser, popularity with the workmen in the yard and his plans to join the Labour party and stand as a Parliamentary candidate.The many statements he made about German shipbuilding ‘they are equal in every way to us as shipbuilders and operators’ and his prophesy that they would once again compete with the British in the size and speed of ocean liners and his left wing politics did nothing to endear him to the Chairman of Harland  Wolff.For Pirrie, a Liberal but conservative by nature and by now a rising star of the British establishment, the idea of a relative with known German sympathies making statements like this and with a daughter married to a former aide of the Kaiser was galling enough, but,he had lived long enough to discover Carlisle also planned to visit his old friend the now ex-Kaiser, it would probably have ended their relationship.Eighteen months after Pirrie’s death in November  Carlisle did just that and visited Wilhelm exiled at Doorn in the Netherlands he said at the time ‘My friends tell me that it was an extra-ordinary thing for a British subject to accept the hospitality of the former War Lord, whose subjects, military and civilian, chanted the Hymn of Hate, but I am an unconventional man.’He stayed for a weekend and in some style the standards the Kaiser was used to in the old days at Potsdam were still kept up. He brought along his autograph book and the two men reminisced about many of the famous names the book contained and, le before the war. Carlisle had been unwell for sometime with heart and lung problems, and during his stay ‘took a chill’.Defining convention to the very end he organized and paid for his funeral in advance, proudly showing off to family and friends the framed cremation certicate that cost pound s d and telling them how cheap it was to dispose of himself in this way and that it was time he disappeared from this earthly stage.That time came on  March  at his London home and three days later, on the th, his funeral, as arranged, took place at Golders Green in North West London. The German theme continued with light music - Schubert’s ‘Reminiscences’ and ‘Nachtstuck’ and an Allegretto by Mendelssohn - played by an organist who was also paid in advance. There was no clergyman present, no formal religious rites were observed, no hymns were sung and no prayers were recited. The small group of mourners included his two daughters, sisters Viscountess Pirrie, Mrs Hunter and several family friends. After the cremation he left instructions for the ‘Merry Widow’ waltz to be played as his ashes were scattered in the Garden of Rest. ‘I am sure it will be more agreeable than the dead march from “Saul”’, he had remarked.So ended the le of a remarkable man. During his letime Carlisle had overseen the tremendous growth in world shipbuilding and his own part, pivotal in transforming the emigrant ship into a virtual floating city and the need for improved le saving appliances in the new generation of large passenger liners, but his plans were ignored. Many of the obituaries published in Britain omitted mention of Titanic, still a painful subject even in . In other countries that was not the case and he was given the credit he deserved for his far sighted designs and for the influence he made on British and world shipbuilding, denied him in modern times because of the power of film, the very thing, paradoxically, that has been largely responsible for keeping the story of Titanic alive.

He is poised to recommend a series of relaxations during Thursday#s meeting of the Executive.He also said he wants to provide indicative dates to help businesses to prepare for reopening as Covid fatigue risks itself mutating into Covid despair.Meanwhile, the chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said he believes the vaccination programme has saved hundreds of lives across Northern Ireland, adding that we have made signicant progress since the dark days of winter.He declared: I believe we are on the cusp of better, happier times.At a Department of Health Press conference on Wednesday, Mr Swann said: We still have work to do in combating this virus and while we must never be complacent, it is undoubtedly the case that very signicant progress has been made.This is a suitable time to pay tribute to the collective determination of all the people across Northern Ireland. We have maintained and observed effective restrictions from Boxing Day until Easter - that has required remarkable commitment and incredible sacrices.Many lives have been saved as a result, intolerable pressures have been lted from our health service, and now we can step cautiously into a new environment. The scales are tipping in favour of relaxations of some of our restrictions and being able to accelerate that process.Mr Swann said he wants to give people more opportunities to meet up with family and friends outdoors in as safe a way as possible.The UUP minister continued: And yes, for those staff members that I met this morning in the South Lake vaccine centre and their #asks#, like many others, it should also mean getting back to the hairdressers and back to the barbers, as it should mean more businesses opening and considering even more people getting back to their caravans earlier than we would have previously thought.To all those who have been bending my ear and making those asks, let me just say to them, I have listened to you and I hear you.I can confirm that my department has now fed into the central process and whilst I will not pre-empt any decisions ahead of tomorrow#s Executive, I do hope the agreed review will show clear signs of positivity and progress after it.Paying tribute to the public for following guidance, and health and social care staff for their dedication throughout the pandemic, Dr McBride said the reduction in infections has been down to the effectiveness of the lockdown.He said: You have helped us get this virus under control and you have saved many, many lives.We now thankfully have some head room and some opportunity for some restrictions to be eased on a phased basis as the Executive#s pathway intended.Dr McBride also stressed that UK regulators have said the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective as he urged anyone who is eligible for a vaccine to make an appointment as soon as possible.It is the right thing to do, this is our passport to better times, he said.I know there will be some concerns and while no medicine, no vaccine is without risk, the UK and EU regulators have again confirmed that these are safe and effective vaccines and the benefits far outweigh any potential side effects for the vast majority of people.I believe vaccination has already saved hundreds of lives in Northern Ireland and it will save more so we need to maintain the momentum and get as many people vaccinated as soon as possible. I believe we are on the cusp of better, happier times and vaccination is central to getting us there. Northern Ireland on Wednesday recorded another death linked to Covid-, while  new cases of the virus have been diagnosed. There were  Covid- inpatients, of which eight were in intensive care and four care home outbreaks.Belfast Related ContentPlayCoronavirus PremiumVideo: The five sectors eagerly awaiting decision on easing restrictionsThe Executive is set to hold a crunch meeting today to discuss the easing of lockdown restrictions, with many eagerly awaiting news of what sectors are to open up.Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyArlene Foster#s sleepless night after Christian Jessen #trashed# marriage with  affair rumour tweetRangers legend Ally McCoist condemns social media video of Neil LennonLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlayBelfast hopes for Executive coronavirus announcement\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bc .ece AUTOCROP wh ebbfedaeeacdeea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bc .ece AUTOCROP wh ebbfedaeeacdeea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayManshot in west Belfast paramilitary style attackPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#Latest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and  new cases as Executive to announce easing of lockdownSport to recommence at Northern Ireland schools, Weir tells principalsNI retail chief Glyn Roberts: #Civic duty# for shoppers to spend £bn stashed away over past yearLatest from Belfast Pat Finucane#s widow wins legal battle over investigation into solicitor#s murder in Belfast man who attacked his ex-partner avoids jailBBC coverage of death of Duke of Edinburgh breaks UK TV complaints recordMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageEquality watchdog warns of ‘two-tier society’ with virus status certicates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It exports to over  countries.The company has fared reasonably well more recently following the end of the Brexit transition period, and is in a great position with its four factories in NI and four in the Republic, said Mr Hanley.While there are no issues with moving goods from NI to GB, Mr Hanley said they did make a strategic decision to avoid the land bridge across Britain to connect to the rest of Europe, and now ship all other product directly out of Ireland. The NI Protocol, meaning no checks on the Irish border, has been important for the business, though there are some questions over mixed origin products and, going forward, support programmes in the event of a downturn.

Loyalist paramilitary sources say while they are not responsible for orchestrating the protests they will also not do anything to stop them.

Despite the Loyalist Communities Council releasing a statement calling for calm on Friday, there are still those within the organisation who refused to condemn the violence, leading to a dispute among senior members of the umbrella group.The LCC, which represents the UVF, factions of the UDA, and Red Hand Commando, said none of their associated groups have been involved, either directly or indirectly, in the violence.However, the Belfastunderstands that members of the paramilitary organisations and affiliated bands will be participating in the protests.SDLP MLA and Policing Board member Dolores Kelly condemned the plans as reckless.We are still in a Covid pandemic, I have sisters who work in nursing and I don#t know that NHS staff could go through a third wave, bringing crowds onto the street at this time is totally reckless.This brings flashbacks to the worst days of the Drumcree protests, that spiralled into violence, including - some people forget - the murder of a policeman, Frankie O#Reilly.Mr O#Reilly, an RUC constable, was injured by a blast bomb thrown during clashes with loyalists in Portadown in , He died from his injuries after spending four weeks on a le support.Mrs Kelly added: There really is a real need for leadership within unionist parties, not upping the ante about the Protocol, or talk of two tier policing or myths around deprivation, whenever there is very little dference for those living on the Falls or the Shankill in terms of deprivation.Belfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyArlene Foster#s sleepless night after Christian Jessen #trashed# marriage with  affair rumour tweetRangers legend Ally McCoist condemns social media video of Neil LennonLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlayBelfast hopes for Executive coronavirus announcement\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bc .ece AUTOCROP wh ebbfedaeeacdeea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bc .ece AUTOCROP wh ebbfedaeeacdeea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayManshot in west Belfast paramilitary style attackPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#Latest Northern IrelandPat Finucane#s widow wins legal battle over investigation into solicitor#s murder in Belfast man who attacked his ex-partner avoids jailMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageIs a Jamie Bryson Joe Brolly bromance blossoming  Pints and footie matches planned as unlikely lads strike up a friendshipPermanent facilities for Brexit checks at NI ports will not be ready ‘until ’Latest from Belfast Pat Finucane#s widow wins legal battle over investigation into solicitor#s murder in Belfast man who attacked his ex-partner avoids jailBBC coverage of death of Duke of Edinburgh breaks UK TV complaints recordMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageEquality watchdog warns of ‘two-tier society’ with virus status certicates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The commissioner#s intervention followed revelations about Sinn Féin#s Abú system - an internal party database based on the electoral register that also records people#s voting intentions and patterns.Central to the watchdog#s questions is whether Sinn Féin fully complied with data protection laws in developing the voter database.After days of silence, yesterday Sinn Fein issued a statement saying that the party was in full compliance with the regulations concerning the use of the electoral register.The domain name - sfabu, which was password protected - is no longer in use, as a precautionary security measure, following publication by your newspaper, a spokesperson said.The party confirmed that it had received correspondence from the DPC and looked forward to engaging with them.Sinn Féin also said the Abú database is the electoral register which it said is made available to political parties and elected representatives for electoral purposes as a part of the democratic process.A spokesperson added: It should be noted that there is similar commercial software available and that the Houses of the Oireachtas also makes a constituency database - which utilises the electoral register - available to all TDs to assist them in carrying out their roles.Fine Gael Senator John Cummins welcomed the DPC#s move but said Sinn Féin still had more questions to answer, including where the database was stored, who was running it and how it was paid for.The Data Protection Commissioner is expected to ask Sinn Féin whether it followed all GDPR laws in setting up the Abú system, which would include telling people their personal information was uploaded to a party database.It is also expected the commissioner will seek to establish where Sinn Féin is storing the personal information of millions of voters.A spokesperson for the Data Protection Commissioner said yesterday: This afternoon we have contacted Sinn Féin with a series of questions arising from matters arising from media reporting.Belfast Most ReadWatch: Video tour of £.m Dromore property that’s sparked online frenzyArlene Foster#s sleepless night after Christian Jessen #trashed# marriage with  affair rumour tweetRangers legend Ally McCoist condemns social media video of Neil LennonLoyalists parades planned in widespread acts of defianceNorthern Ireland hairdressers and more retail could reopen in daysTop VideosPlayBelfast hopes for Executive coronavirus announcement\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bc .ece AUTOCROP wh ebbfedaeeacdeea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news bc .ece AUTOCROP wh ebbfedaeeacdeea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayManshot in west Belfast paramilitary style attackPlayVideo: X-rated footage of woman stripping outside a Comber bar branded #disgusting#Latest Republic of IrelandMinisters back proposal to remove fully vaccinated from quarantine listEU countries reopening to holidaymakers ‘will take some time’Garda Youth Diversion Projects to be expanded under new Government strategy.million euro winning Lotto ticket was sold in KilkennyLeo Varadkar: We are on track to lt restrictions on May Latest from Belfast Pat Finucane#s widow wins legal battle over investigation into solicitor#s murder in Belfast man who attacked his ex-partner avoids jailDrop it – Jose Mourinho may never explain why Spurs squander so many pointsBBC coverage of death of Duke of Edinburgh breaks UK TV complaints recordMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling average,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Communications between Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin and the Health and Finance Ministers demonstrates that even those heading government departments have been confused about what Covid restrictions were in force and when. Localised restrictions were put in place in Derry and Strabane on October  following a surge in positive Covid cases. As part of those restrictions no indoor gatherings were permitted between people from dferent households. That specic restriction prevented barbers and hairdressers from working. In an Assembly response Health Minister Robin Swann acknowledged that fact saying close contact services were not permitted to open from October  because of the restriction on indoor gatherings. googletag.cmd.push But, he states, official regulations were only in effect between October  to November , November  to December  and those from December  are ongoing. The Localised Restrictions Support Schemeopened to businesses in Derry and Strabane council area on October , . However, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has questioned why some of her constituents have been left unable to access support for the period between October -. She also asked Finance Minister Conor Murphy why his department is ‘recovering’ money from Derry workers who had received support. Sinead McLaughlin said: It has been dficult for businesses in Derry to understand the restrictions which govern when they were allowed to trade, and when they werent. googletag.cmd.push “What we have now learnt as a result of my questions in the Assembly to the ministers is that it has also been dficult for the departments that issue the regulations to understand them. The result is that close contact businesses such as hairdressers and barbers in Derry and Strabane which believed they were unable to trade between the th and the th October now find they are not entitled to financial support for that period from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by minister Conor Murphy and his Department of Finance. “Some of these businesses were initially given this financial support and are now having it recovered through reductions in ongoing support payments.”     She added: The minister for health initially told me that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane were not able to trade between th and th October because of the lockdown restrictions, but that the regulations had not been in place that confirmed this. “Now a revised Assembly answer from the minister says they were able to trade between those dates. To explain six months later that close contact businesses in Derry and Strabane could, after all, have traded in early October is absolutely no good at all. “I am appalled that businesses here are now suffering additional hardship because of the lack of clarity and co-operation between the health and finance departments in the setting of Covid regulations. “It is up to Conor Murphy to resolve this and I am very unhappy that, to date, he has failed to do this. The Finance Minister stands over his department’s decision saying that Covid regulations imposed by the Department of Health on October  did not require hairdressers and other close contact services to close during the period to October . He added: “As the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance for businesses directly restricted by the Health Protection Regulations, I am unable to extend support to any close contact service for that period. “The criteria for the Localised Restrictions Support Schemeis directly linked to the Health Protection Regulations and there is no need to review the criteria.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster District councillor, Gavin Bell, alongside MLA for the area Emma Sheerin, have been lobbying for action to be taken outside Ballylford Primary School. Cllr Bell raised concerns that motorists were using the village as a natural bypass of congested towns and villages linking the M and M motorways. “Parents, teachers and others across the Loughshore community have voiced their concerns that there is a tragedy waiting to happen here,” he said. “I campaigned a few years ago, with support from Francie Molloy MP, to help bring about the speed reduction from mph to mph at primary schools in Ballinderry, Ballylford and Drummullan. googletag.cmd.push “Following on from that, I have been requesting speed cushions to be installed outside Ballylford Primary School, however, this continues to get knocked back because of DfI policy. “If speed ramps or physically measures are needed, then surely the rule of too many vehicular movements on the road should be overridden, especially where a primary school is involved.” Ms Sheerin has written to the Minister for Infrastructure, calling for Ballylford PS to be added to the list of schools benefiting from new signage. “I’ve asked the Infrastructure Minister to add Ballylford Primary to the list of schools, and to implement other speed calming measures at this point of the Ballinderry Bridge Road,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Unfortunately she has maintained that it doesn’t meet the criteria at present, which I would challenge, and has also cited budgetary constraints as a factor. “Rural roads and the safety of our school children cannot come second to financial issues. Road safety must be prioritised.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Fein councillor Sandra Duffy said she had been contacted by residents in the Ballyarnett area concerned about the asphalt plans so close to their homes. Councillors agreed to a proposal from SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins that the local council contact its counterpart in Donegal to convey their objection to the plans for the plant which would produce asphalt for use in roads and driveways. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he said. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack. Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign. After being taken prisoner at Bertencourt, he was held in prisoner of war camps in Le Quesnoy Limburg and Dulman, before being discharged as ‘no longer physically fit for war service’ in .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack.Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign. After being taken prisoner at Bertencourt, he was held in prisoner of war camps in Le Quesnoy Limburg and Dulman, before being discharged as ‘no longer physically fit for war service’ in .

At present, food and garden waste are collected separately. However, under a new system, householders will be asked to combine food and garden in the larger garden waste bin for collection. This change was approved by councillors at a meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District Councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The new collection system has been run on a pilot basis in Strabane but is now to be extended to other areas across the council. Councillors were told at yesterdays meeting that the change will only be introduced where practical to do so and those properties without gardens – terraced housing, maisonettes etc – will continue to receive a weekly food waste collection using existing collection methods. googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: “If you have a big brown garden waste bin youll be permitted to put bagged food waste in it from now on. “Make sure that youve got the food in a compostable bag like you would have done when recycling food using your outdoor caddy. “Collections will be fortnightly on the same day as your existing garden waste collection.” The spokesperson added: “Well be letting everyone everyone affected know about this change in more detail over the next few weeks and will be providing handy tips on recycling at home.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Have you always been involved in sport  No, I didn’t really like sport when I was younger. I was definitely more of a spectator than a participant! How long have you been involved in running and when did you join the club  I started running in October  and joined Sperrin Harriers in April . Why did you start running  A friend of mine, , said that I wouldn’t be able to run a half marathon when I told them my plan to try to run the Omagh half marathon in April . googletag.cmd.push My competitive streak got the better of me and I wanted to prove them wrong and so my love of running grew from there,  What type of events do you compete in and what distances are involved  I love competing in the local races, anything from a k to half marathon. There’s always a great atmosphere and lots of tea and buns afterwards! Which one do you rank as your toughest  I find k’s toughest as I prefer longer distances. What has been the most memorable so far  I thoroughly enjoyed Belfast half marathon in September . Our club organised a bus down to the race and so there was a great atmosphere and club spirit from early on. googletag.cmd.push I had set myself a target to complete it in under  hours and coming up that final stretch and seeing the clock at . was a great feeling. What have been your main achievements to date  I think just being able to take up a new hobby and enjoy it is an achievement in itself. I highly doubt that I’ll ever make a podium spot but for me, it’s more about having fun, seeing the benefits to both your physical and mental health and keeping at it, even when you have a bad run or it’s pouring outside. What has been your highest point so far      Definitely my first half marathon in Omagh in . At around   miles, I thought I wouldn’t finish but the support of great friends and the club spurred me on. What is your most disappointing point  Not being able to run my first Stanley Reid  mile Classic in August . I had a hip injury at the time and so couldn’t participate. Have you had any injuries in your career  I’ve had a hip injury on and off, but thankfully none at present. How often do you train and what does it all entail  I try to run  times per week and to do some speed work and some longer miles each week. A long run on a Sunday is one of my favourite times of the week! Im sure  was a dficult season. Did you manage to get much running done and what are your targets for   It has definitely been a lot harder to keep up running on your own. I tried to keep my motivation up by participating in some virtual runs and challenges. Our club also organised a virtual around the world challenge where each week we emailed through how many miles we had run that week and collectively, we used the miles to travel around the world. It was great to see how far we had travelled and what our next destination was. My main aim for  is, fingers crossed, to complete my first full marathon in Dublin in October. Is there a long term goal you have, something you have always wanted to achieve  I definitely want to run a marathon and all being well, Dublin marathon in October . What advice do you have for anyone who is thinking about taking up running  If you are thinking about taking up running, just go for it! I couldn’t run m this time  years ago, never mind a k or half marathon! Just go at your own pace and you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve when you put your mind to it. I would also recommend joining a running club. The support from other club members is so encouraging and it’s such a great way to make new friends who have a similar love for the sport.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan. It was all by chance and by opportunity and here I am, sitting in Thailand.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have seen athletes and athletics fans across Twitter tweeting and retweeting, and its been shared so much on Facebook. It has been an amazing journey.Spartan Bradley is seen as one of the most talented athletes to come from the city in recent years. He ran the  Barcelona Half-Marathon in a time of :, and who starred at the  Morton Games in Dublin, running a spectacular time of : in the m. He has been running competitively since he was  and has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years.Once Eamon, and fellow producer Paul Gormley decided to focus more locally, they were pointed in Conors direction, and the first seeds of It Runs Deep were planted.It all started back in Vienna when we went to see Eliud Kipchoge run, he explained. We wanted to make a documentary but when we were at that global stage we felt that we wanted to make something more at home and tell a local story. We felt that because it was the first documentary, it was the best place to start.Conors was a story that had to be told. That summer of  was really a showcase of the talent and the passion thats always been there. With that we unveiled the amazing success that Ireland had in Lisbon , so we really expand upon that. Ultimately its just a showcase of the talent that we have in our Track  Field here in Ireland, on the local level, on the national level and on the international level. googletag.cmd.push Released todayThe film makes its big premiere today on YouTube, and is sure to capture the imagination of those on the local running scene and beyond. However, having already received support and encouragement from across the board, Eamon and his team, who have poured everything into this documentary for two years, are confident that it will resonate beyond the world of athletics also.The overwhelming support that we have been given so far, not just locally, but around the country has been amazing, he added. It has been very collaborative and it has been beautul to capture a story within the world of athletics and were really looking forward to sharing it. Hopefully it resonates not just with athletics fans but hopefully sports fans and people who are interested in story telling in general, a story of patience and endurance, both on the creative side and on the athletics side. googletag.cmd.push For those wishing to view the documentary film, simply visit YouTube and search for It Runs Deep documentary.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours. If itrsquos the latter, ever member of the chamber and everyone across this district will be up for that fight..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Church.jpg","title":"Church delivers huge food donation  ","story":"THE Journey Church in Downpatrick has been working to distribute more than pound, worth of food supplies to ious food banks across the district.Over a seven-week period, dozens of volunteers worked to ensure that food has been delivered to organisations which get the supplies to families and iniduals who need it most.Itrsquos the latest wave of the local effort from Newry, Mourne and Down Council with funding from the Department for Communitiesto get practical help to families economically affected by the pandemic.From March last year, local groups quickly responded to distribute food parcels to any household in need. The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many.

The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority. This trouble must stop..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Prince.jpg","title":"Prince Philip was most certainly a one off  ","story":"ROWALLANE councillor Terry Andrews has posted a photo on his Facebook page recalling his fatherrsquos meeting with Prince Philip during a visit to Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough in .Mr Paul Andrews mdash who was secretary of Killyleagh Wildfowlers at the time and heavily involved with the work of a conservation group connected with the internationally acclaimed waterway mdash often recalled with his family details of the meeting with the senior Royal.The social media post, which shows the Prince deep in conversation with Crossgar man Mr Andrews and two others, took pride of place in the Killyleagh home of Herbie and Mary Andrews, Paulrsquos parents.Not only that, a photo of their grandson Terry meeting Prince Andrew when he visited Killyleagh in  also took pride of place in his grandparentsrsquo home.So they had two photos of a father and a son meeting a Royal father and son.ldquoMy father said he found the Duke of Edinburgh to be a perfect gentleman and enjoyed the conversation that he had with him, Terry revealed.ldquoThe Prince was quite interested about Strangford Lough, its environs and history. It was clear that while he had a full diary given his role as the Queenrsquos consort, he was way ahead of his time when it came to environmental, wildle and conservation issues.Terry said the television coverage of the Princersquos le, which ended just a few short months short of his th birthday, brought many memories of his own family flooding back.ldquoWatching the old black and white footage and Prince Philiprsquos military service in particular brought back memories of my grandfather Herbie and his brothers, including my uncle, Andy Andrews, who joined the Royal Navy.ldquoMy grandfather served in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers as a Regimental Sergeant Major serving in India in the s and in the Second World War in Belgium where, behind enemy lines, he was shot.ldquoMiraculously, the bullet struck a pocket watch that his mother gave him, saving his le.

My father described the Prince as the perfect gentleman.ldquoHis sad passing does indeed mark the end of a era Prince Philip was truly unique and I know that from talking to my dad that he enjoyed his visits to Northern Ireland. The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

By last year they were in the top .Even so the odds are stacked against the Northern Ireland women’s soccer team. They are representing a country that is very small by international standards, with a population of a mere . million people.As a consequence, they play against national teams of much larger countries, where the players are professionals.In NI, they are part timers.As the midfielder Sarah McFadden said yesterday: “We make a lot of sacrices all of us. I’ve got a three-year-old who I leave at home for  days.”All the hard work and training under the team’s inspirational coach Kenny Shiels has paid off.It was a wonderful moment to see this Northern Ireland team celebrating their triumph.The NI men’s teams have provided similar moments of joy over the decades, qualying for the world cups of ,  and , as well as the Euros of .This latest triumph is a huge boost for female sports in general in the Province, and comes at a time when there is a great focus on the importance of developing sport among children of both sexes.It has also happened towards the end of a lockdown that — many people in the sporting world fear — has allowed school pupils to fall out of the habit of sport and exercise, and all of the social and physical benefits that it can bring.There has been much talk about a sports museum for Northern Ireland. It is an excellent idea, and would be a fine tourist attraction. Ifcomes to fruition, Tuesday night will be one of the milestone moments for such a venue to record and explain.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre.

We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down.

Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available.

About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The demographics of the town and the cross community damage their decision will cause completely ignored.“Again the plan to steamroll forward with their original proposal, while ignoring the wishes of the community. Their plan to shut the Lurgan Campus of Craigavon Senior High School, the only KS controlled non grammar school in the area to bus the children to Portadown starting September .“This decision takes place at the same time as we see two Catholic Maintained Schools within a mile radius being built from the ground up to the tune of £+ million while the Protestant children watch their school close and pushed from their town like second class citizens. This is an absolute disgrace. “The DUP has paid lip service to the campaign to keep our children in Lurgan. “A previous Sinn Fein Minister delivered for his community, the DUP is failing theirs. Currently there is a DUP minister in charge of Education who has the final say on this. “If this school shuts and these children are forced to move to another town to be educated it will be under a DUP watch. They will be totally and absolutely to blame and we will make sure it won’t be forgotten. No longer will they be able to point the finger at a Sinn Fein minister as their minister will be making the call on this.“The DUP inaction compared to their save the Dickson Plan campaign is in stark contrast. A failing educational system that needs a complete overhaul, a system of education that looks nothing like the original setup that was intended to serve all. It has been manipulated and changed over the years with self interest to serve the grammar schools first and foremost while everyone  suffers. A system the DUP fought tooth and nail to keep and which has now led to the situation we are in today and they are silent.“You the community also had your part to play but did you have the fight  That is a question you must ask yourself as another resource is ripped from the heart of a once proud community. You can still play your part though, you can demand your MP, MLAs and Councillors put pressure on the Education Minister to reject this proposal, tell them your vote relies on support for your community, that you will accept nothing less than major investment in your children and grandchildren’s future within your own town.“Once this school goes that’s it, it won’t be coming back and we stand over our claim that over time this will have a detrimental effect right across the protestant community in Lurgan.

The signicant loss of le, including women and children, is totally unacceptable as is the continued detention of elected leaders.“The military coup has also seen a clampdown on a range of freedoms, whether that be internet restrictions being imposed, curfews or restrictions on gatherings. The people of Myanmar are living under a reign of fear and that is something the international community cannot stand by and allow to continue. More sanctions are needed and a concerted international effort to restore calm, and theof parliamentary democracy.Carla Lockhart delivers her maiden speech.“I have been deeply moved by the local care and love for the people of Myanmar, not least from members of Newmills Presbyterian Church who have visited Myanmar. It was good to facilitate a meeting between members and FCDO officials to allow sharing of concerns around freedom of religion, and to hear of the Government action being taken. We need to see change soon, before more lives are lost.”Bakers at Blissful Bites mark th anniversary Read full story here--Editor’s Message:Thank you for reading this article.
