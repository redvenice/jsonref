Liverpool lead at the break but there’s very little in it.On loan at Southampton from Liverpool and therefore ineligible for this game, Takumi Minamino is replaced by Theo Walcott in Ralph Hassenhuttl’s only change.Goals from Hakim Ziyech and Marcos Alonso cancelled out Raheem Sterling’s opener, the Spaniard scoring in the second minute of added time to steal all three points for Chelsea and put Manchesterr City’s title coronation on hold. Chelsea go third and Liverpool find themselves nine points off the top four, having played two games fewer than Leicester and Chelsea. Southmapton loanee Takumi Minamino is unable to play against his parent club and will have to watch this one from the stands, where he will be joined by his fellow striker Danny Ings, who is not expected to play again this season. The fitness of Ryan Bertrand is also in doubt and he may be replaced by Jack Stephens. Yannick Westergard is available for selection, after Southampton got the ridiculous red card he was shown in their game against Leicester last weekend overturned. Midfielder Oriel Romeu remains out as he recovers from a fractured foot. Having claimed just six points from the past 30 available at Anfield, the outcome of tonight’s match is by no means a foregone conclusion, even if Jurgen Klopp’s side are hosting a Southampton team that have largely uinderwhelmed and are without a win in their past three games.

Meaning while infection rates in wealthy countries have dropped as vaccination rates increased this year, infections are still rising in 36 countries, with India’s daily cases skyrocketing to nearly 400,000 a day. The man, in his mid-30s, was rushed into Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth, where he was reported to be in a stable condition.  Western Australia reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and the state is monitoring 22 active cases. The Department of Health announced on Twitter that four cases have been identified as well as 11 cases of the variant first discovered in the UK.  More on US states vaccine decline here:  Macron told reporters at an EU summit in Porto: “I call very clearly on the United States to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production,” referring to a de facto US ban on the export of vaccine raw materials. Dr Clive Dix, who led the programme from December until he stepped down last week, said he believed the UK population would be protected from the virus and its known variants by the summer. In an interview with the Daily , Dr Dix said the UK was on track to meet its target of administering at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine to all adults by the end of July. When all adults have been vaccinated against the virus, Dix said the UK would have “probably protected the population from all the variants that are known, and we’ll be safe over the coming winter”. The departing vaccine chief said it was his personal prediction that by some time in August, “we will have no circulating virus in the UK”. My colleague Molly Blackall has more here:  Last week, President Tayyip Erdogan announced a “full lockdown” until May 17 to curb a surge in infections and deaths after the country eased restrictions in early March, Reuters reports.  The data showed a further 281 deaths on Saturday, raising the total toll to 42,746. Total cases have now exceeded 5 million despite a recent fall in infections and deaths during the lockdown.After meeting Health Minister Roberto Speranza to discuss the easing of restrictions for countries where vaccination levels are high, Di Maio said, quarantine requirements may also be scrapped for those arriving from the United States from June. People entering Italy from other European countries and Israel face five days of quarantine and mandatory testing before arrival and at the end of their isolation period.  For travellers coming from the U.S., the required quarantine period is 10 days.

Merkle added, ‘If you look at the low incidence (of COVID-19) that some of our European partner countries already have,...then I’m very hopeful that we can also generally afford to do what was possible last summer, too.’ The United States remains the worst-affected country with 580,901 deaths from 32,652,028 cases."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Centres projected to require a third of Ireland\u0026rsquos generated energy within a decadeRevenue in any EU-wide permit scheme ought to accrue to national governmentsEnvironmentalist warns scale-up of Ireland\u0026rsquos offshore wind resources could be undone by lack of public engagement"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 hse advises people to wear face masks as restrictions ease","story":"Mary Plunkett, education officer, at a Wharfedale printing press in the National Print Museum in Beggars Bush, Dublin: Museum staff are preparing to reopen its doors on Monday. Photograph: Donall FarmerFamilies have been advised to maintain social distancing and to wear masks when meeting after Covid-19 restrictions are eased next week. The so-called “vaccine bonus” will see fully vaccinated people from up to three households permitted to mix indoors from Monday. The same will also apply to those who received a first AstraZeneca shot more than four weeks ago and to people who have had a PCR test confirmed infection in the past six months. These groups can also meet indoors with unvaccinated people from another household, provided they are not at risk of severe illness. The measures aim to benefit older people and those with health conditions who have had to spend lengthy periods cocooning since the pandemic began. While home visits among vaccinated people do not technically require masks or social distancing, health officials are stressing the need to continue to follow advice on hygiene and to act appropriately in the interest of safety. Speaking on RTÉ’s News at One on Friday, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said it was appropriate for grandparents to have physical contact with grandchildren “provided you keep a small number of people in your social bubble if that’s going to include grandchildren, well and good”.Underscoring the impact of vaccines, he said, recipients “have a much, much greater reduction, or reduced chance of becoming sick or hospitalised” with Covid-19 as a result of their jabs. He said the risk of infection and illness fell “perhaps 90 per cent or more after two doses and certainly 80 per cent or more in some cases after the first dose”. However, Dr Henry stressed his preference for mask wearing where possible and for people to limit their social contacts. A series of other restrictions are being eased from Monday, allowing people to meet in groups outdoors, travel outside their county and the reopening of some economic activity. A maximum of three households or six people from any number of households can come together outside, including in private gardens, and the limit of six will not include children aged 12 or younger. Organised outdoor gatherings with a maximum of 15 people and outdoor training for adults in pods of up to the same number will also be allowed. Religious services can resume, although ceremonies such as Communions and Confirmations are not being permitted to go ahead for now, and caps on funeral attendances, a major bone of contention in recent months, will increase to 50. However, “related events” before or after are to remain on hold.Fifty guests are allowed at wedding services but receptions and celebrations remain restricted to six indoors and 15 outdoors. Retail will undergo a phased reopening from Monday with click-and-collect services and in-store appointments permitted ahead of shops opening more normally from May 17th. Personal services such as hairdressers and salons can reopen on an appointment-only basis. Galleries, museums and cultural attractions too will reopen to the public as will lending services in libraries. Public transport capacity will be increased to 50 per cent. Case study: ‘It could be a slow staggered return or we could see a flurry’At the National Print Museum in Dublin’s Beggar’s Bush, staff have been busily preparing to reopen their doors to visitors. But, like the industry generally, they do not know what to expect. “It could go one of two ways,” said chief executive Carla Marrinan. “It could be a slow staggered return or we could see a flurry. You never know.” Despite the prevailing uncertainty, Ms Marrinan is focused on what they will offer next week – two new exhibitions, including one on pandemic-produced artworks – and reassurance that museums are safe to visit. Things have been so negative in the cultural arena, positivity is crucial. The museum not only saw a collapse in visitors, but also in corporate revenue and income from the venue being hired. Propped up by some State funding, it has survived and its new approach is toward self-guided tours in a well-ventilated, spacious building that still has culture at its centre.“The big concern now is that we won’t see a big return,” Ms Marrinan said, noting that last summer people left the capital while tourism dried up. “A lot of them were sick of their 5km and were getting out of Dublin and because of Covid people were a bit too nervous to come back.” The museum managed to retain all staff and they have been working with an eye on reopening, but their uncertainty about the week ahead is common in an era where people have been drilled on the importance of staying outside. Gina O’Kelly, executive director of the Irish Museums Association (IMA), which represents about 80 institutions on the island, said many would not reopen next week, preferring to await the return of “audience confidence”. The problem is particularly acute for independent outfits lacking the kind of central State funding that fuels the national cultural institutions. Those largely dependent on entrance fees, cafes and gift shops are under considerably more pressure to turn the cash flow back on. However, Ms O’Kelly said those accustomed to operating in a historically under-funded industry may prove best placed to survive.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity.

File photograph:  Bryan O’BrienThe involvement of columnist Eoghan Harris in an anonymous anti-Sinn Féin social media account was discovered after the account shared secret details of a poll on a united Ireland last week.The well-known writer and former senator was dropped by the Sunday Independent as a columnist on Thursday after management learned he was contributing to a Twitter account operating behind the fake name of Barbara Pym.Sunday Independent editor Alan English said the content posted from the account, much of which was directed at Sinn Féin and nationalists, went beyond fair and reasonable comment and was a “betrayal of trust”.ConfrontedIt is understood Harris’s involvement in the account, which used the handle @barbarapym2, came to light last weekend as the Sunday Independent prepared to published the results of a poll it had commissioned on a united Ireland.Harris was given the results of the poll ahead of publication. Shortly afterwards, details appeared on the Pym account. Management approached Harris and he admitted contributing to the account. This account was confirmed by Harris to The  yesterday.Harris told The  he thought the poll results were in the public domain at the time that the Pym account shared them.Yesterday, Twitter suspended the Pym account on the grounds it broke the platform’s rules on “platform manipulation”.The company bans the use of accounts which “artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behaviour that manipulates or disrupts people’s experience on Twitter”. It also banned a further eight accounts, which it said were linked to the Pym account.\u0026nbspSome of these accounts had also been used to share vitriolic anti-Sinn Féin content. However, Harris said he was only involved in the Pym account, which he operated with five or six other people.He declined to name these people, saying he did not want to “get them shot”.Since February 2020, the Pym account has frequently criticised, and sometimes insulted, politicians, journalists and other public figures, who it suggested were pro-Sinn Féin.It was also regularly used to praise the work of Harris and his colleagues at the newspaper, while railing against other journalists’ work.One of those criticised by the account, Irish Examiner political correspondent Aoife Grace Moore, alleged on Twitter that the Pym account had sent her sexualised messages and had called her a terrorist, resulting in her seeking counselling.ComplaintMr Harris admitted the account was used to send tweets asking if Moore was “turned on” by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald being the first woman to lead the Opposition as well as tweets referring to her “sniping safely from behind Derry hedges,” adding that “her SF backside is sticking up in the air”.However, he said these were “clearly political and could equally be applied to a man”.It is understood a complaint has been made to gardaí in Pearse Street, Dublin, regarding abusive tweets sent to Moore. This complaint was made before Harris was confirmed as a contributor to the account and it has yet to be progressed by gardaí.Political activismWhile he had a long association with the Sunday Independent, Harris (79) started out in current affairs in RTÉ in the 1960s when he was also involved in republican and Marxist politics. Through the 1970s he was active with the Workers’\u0026nbspParty, and became a staunch critic of the IRA and Sinn Féin.He played a role - the significance of which is still much disputed - in Mary Robinson’s successful 1990 presidential campaign, and he acted as a political advisor sporadically for other politicians including former Fine Gael leader John Bruton and former Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble.In 2007, then taoiseach Bertie Ahern nominated him to the Seanad, in part recognition of Harris’ warm relationship with unionists, and he served there until 2011. In recent years, his commentary has focused on the perceived threat of Sinn Féin’s electoral success and what Harris claims has been soft coverage in RTÉ of the party’s operations.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"steve aiken announces resignation as leader of ulster unionist party","story":" Steve Aiken is to resign as leader of the UUP.

File photograph: Laura Hutton  The .The so-called green digital certificates would show if the bearer has been vaccinated, has tested negative for Covid-19, or has recovered from the illness. File photogrpah: Colin KeeganCollins DublinEuropean Union member states will aim to agree on digital vaccination certificates to ease travel in the bloc by June 21st, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has said.“The timetable now would be that we all hope that by the 21st of June… there is an agreement,” Mr Rutte told journalists following a meeting of EU leaders.Some member states would start using the system immediately, but others would wait as late as August as the 27 governments have agreed there would be a six-week period in which to implement the system, he said.“For the Netherlands, we would do that as quickly as possible after 21st of June,” Mr Rutte said.The so-called green digital certificates would show if the bearer has been vaccinated, has tested negative for Covid-19, or has recovered from the illness. Member states can choose to exempt such people from health restrictions such as quarantine or testing requirements.The system is strongly supported by member states where summer tourism is important for the economy, but some northern countries are more hesitant due to concerns about discrimination and the risk of spreading vaccine-resistant Covid-19 variants through travel.Agreement has not yet been reached on some elements of the system, including how to define people who have recovered from Covid-19. “Between now and 21st of June some big decisions need to be taken,” Mr Rutte said.Work is already advanced on building the digital infrastructure required to link countries up to the system, with the first technical trials of the system due later this month.An Irish Government source said the EU is hopeful of having a green cert in place for the Schengen area on the Continent by late June.Officials here will now assess whether Ireland will opt in to the system and when that would happen.VaccinesMeanwhile, the EU has sealed a deal to buy 900 million BioNTech-Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine doses with the option to add 900 million more, the European Commission has announced.“Other contracts and other vaccine technologies will follow,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen wrote on Twitter as she announced the deal.The doses are for delivery between 2021 and 2023 and are intended for use by member states as booster shots against the illness and to allow for the vaccination of children and teenagers if approved by regulators.In addition, the pharmaceutical companies are developing updated vaccines to combat resistant new variants of Covid-19, and future doses will be tailored to address this.The deal confirms a shift towards using an mRNA vaccine in the EU’s inoculation strategy, as evidence mounts of high efficacy in halting the spread of the virus, and because they have had fewer manufacturing delays than the viral vector AstraZeneca jab.The bloc’s current vaccine deliveries put it on course to vaccinate 70 per cent of its adult population by July – catching up with the United States, where vaccine hesitancy is slowing rollout. Some member states including Ireland may hit the target early.The large order will allow EU member states to donate or re-sell doses if they wish, Ms von der Leyen said.“The contract . . . includes the possibility for the member states to donate or resell doses,” the Commission chief told journalists following the summit. “The amount of doses is so large in order to be able to also serve our neighbourhood, for example.”Leaders meetingThe announcement came as EU leaders including Taoiseach Micheál Martin met in Porto in Portugal to discuss the vaccine rollout and economic recovery from the pandemic.In a joint declaration, the EU leaders declared a commitment to use the continent’s €750 billion Covid-19 stimulus package to foster a “fair, sustainable and resilient recovery” and promote good-quality jobs.“As Europe gradually recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, the priority will be to move from protecting to creating jobs and to improve job quality,” the statement read.“We will prioritise action to support young people, who have been very negatively affected by the Covid-19 crisis, which has profoundly disrupted their participation in the labour market as well as their education and training plans.”The Pfizer purchase announcement comes after it was announced that Ireland is to purchase almost 10 million doses of PfizerBioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine in 2022 and 2023 at a cost of €191 million under plans which were approved by Cabinet on Tuesday.The vaccines are part of an EU additional purchase agreement with the pharmaceutical giant and are to be bought for the possibility that booster jabs are needed in the years ahead.Under the EU agreement Ireland would secure approximately 4.9 million doses in 2022 and the same again in 2023.This would be enough to fully vaccinate approximately 2.45 million people with two doses.Ireland will also retain the option of securing an additional 9.8 million doses over the time period.

File photograph: Christophe Petit TessonEPAEuropean Union leaders have rejected a call by the United States to suspend intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines at a meeting in Portugal, arguing that this would not fix a shortage of supply.“We don’t think, in the short term, that it’s the magic bullet,” said European Council President Charles Michel at the event.EU leaders have pointed to tight US controls on exports that have prioritised vaccination of the domestic population before sharing doses overseas, in contrast to EU global exports that have equalled the quantity of doses supplied within the bloc.“Today, the Anglo-Saxons block many of these ingredients and vaccines,” French president Emmanuel Macron said on arrival to the summit. “Today, 100 per cent of the vaccines produced in the United States are for the American market.”He argued that patent protections are not the cause of the bottleneck in global vaccine supply, which has also been affected by shortages of vaccine components.“What is the current issue?” Mr Macron asked. “It is not really about intellectual property. Can you give intellectual property to laboratories that do not know how to produce and will not produce tomorrow? The main issue for solidarity is the distribution of doses.” The proposal from the administration of US president Joe Biden has put EU capitals on the back foot by fuelling momentum for a move strongly opposed by the large European pharmaceutical industry.The call was welcomed as a “monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19” by the World Health Organization chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and has been backed by Pope Francis in a video message to vaccine equity initiative Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World.“A variant of this virus is closed nationalism, which prevents, for example, an internationalism of vaccines,” Pope Francis said. “Another variant is when we put the laws of the market or intellectual property above the laws of love and the health of humanity.”The EU has backed a “third way” to increase the supply of vaccines, under which pharmaceutical companies would co-operate to set up additional manufacturing sites through voluntary licensing agreements.EU officials have said that they support the aim of increasing global supply but that waiving intellectual property rights would not be effective in doing this quickly, noting that readying factories for production takes 12 months even with the co-operation of pharmaceutical companies.“A patent doesn’t tell you how to produce this vaccine. For that, you need to have access to the know-how and the technology,” an EU official said. “If we want to be fast, if we want to go from where we are to an increase of the output, the co-operation with those that have the know-how is essential.”Some agreements to increase production have already been made, involving licensing while retaining protection of the patents, a route already followed by vaccine producer AstraZeneca.

But French officials say additional restrictions were added, including where the vessels can fish and for how long. In response, the flotilla of French ships staged their protest on Thursday morning. It resulted in a delegation of the Jersey government meeting with some of the fishermen to hear their grievances. Mr Gorst told The  it was a listening exercise and it became apparent there had been a problem in communication over the licences. He said the Jersey government would now work with the UK, EU and France to try and resolve the issue. But Mr Dessoude voiced concern that, if the issues are not resolved soon, it could have a damaging impact on the Jersey fishing fleet. The Regional Fishing Committees of Normandy and Brittany called for a ban on Jersey catch being landed in Granville earlier this week, a measure reportedly supported by the Mayor of Granville.Only around 10 per cent of the lobsters caught by Jersey boats are sold onto the island, the rest are usually sold into the French market, Mr Dessoude said.In his 60s and with no financial dependants, Mr Dessoude said he could afford to not go out daily, but the row is having a knock-on effect for his business. With larger boats unable to take their hauls to France they are selling lobsters in Jersey, meaning demand is even lower.He fishes for cuttlefish in April and May but said that, due to bad weather, the hauls have been low this year. I\u0027m more worried about the younger generations, he explained, adding that it is a huge expense to buy and run a fishing vessel and warning: If they don’t remove the ban this week, some of the small boats could go under,.Don Thompson, the president of the Jersey Fishermen\u0027s Association, said all the focus in the row had been on the French fleet, adding: They\u0027ve actually been given four months of amnesty to carry on fishing whilst they make applications for licences to fish in our waters... whilst our fishermen have been banned from landing into France.The real hardship genuinely is on this side, and I\u0027m seeing my colleagues going out of business, fishermen that have done nothing else all their life, made a commitment to the industry since they were very young, having to sell their boats and walk away from the industry.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"may 2021 election results uk maps charts data wales votes","story":"The Scottish Nationalist Party has won the most seats in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, though failed to gain enough for an outright majority. The pro-independence party, led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has secured 64 seats - one short of the 65 needed for overall control of the devolved parliament in Holyrood - while the Conservatives have won 31, Labour 22, the Greens 8 and the Liberal Democrats 4. Meanwhile results from England in the May 6 elections have painted a bleak picture for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, following a historic Conservative win in the Hartlepool by-election and gains on key councils.Millions of Britons across on Thursday voted in a bumper crop of elections – the UK\u0027s first major democratic exercise since the country was hit by coronavirus last year. So-called Super Thursday saw people cast their ballots in a wide variety of races - some delayed due to the pandemic - that include 143 English councils, the Scottish and Welsh devolved parliaments and the London mayoral contest.See below for live results for all of these major elections – or alternatively use our postcode tool to find specific tallies for the elections in your local area. Super Thursday saw people in Scotland vote for 129 MSPs to sit in the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood - a number split between 73 that represent constituencies and 56 that represent the eight regions of the country. This means 65 seats are needed for a majority.By late on Friday night it was clear Ms Sturgeon was headed for a Holyrood election win, her fourth consecutive victory in a row – but it is now clear she has missed out on an SNP majority she could have used to place pressure on Boris Johnson to drop his opposition to a second independence referendum.However, the SNP has improved on its last showing, when it fell two short of a majority in the last election in 2016, having previously gained the first majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011. The SNP had vowed to use a majority to push ahead with an 11-point roadmap on securing a second referendum on Scottish independence. Yet an alliance with other pro-independence parties in Holyrood, such as the Scottish Greens, may mean this plan is still on the table for Ms Sturgeon.  In the past year, polls have suggested a surge in support for independence but this has gradually subsided over recent weeks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described a second referendum \u0027irresponsible and reckless\u0027 as the UK recovers from the coronavirus pandemic in an exclusive interview with The . A total of 143 council elections were held in England on Thursday, with around 5,000 seats up for grabs in local authorities ranging from shire county councils to metropolitan boroughs. Local returning officers are continuing to deliver council results on Saturday, after declarations on Friday suggested a disappointing election for Labour amid gains for the Conservatives.Harlow, a local district in the west of Essex, has seen seven new Tory councillors, enough for the party to gain a majority after after nine years of Labour control.The Conservatives have also clinched enough seats to gain a majority on Nuneaton \u0026amp Bedford, Dudley and Northumberland, all of which previously had no party with overall control. But Labour have managed to hold onto some key councils, including Newcastle and South Tyneside, despite losing seats.Council elections are one of the big battlegrounds of Super Thursday, with all eyes on the results from the Red Wall –Labour heartlands that swung to the Conservatives at the 2019 general election. Local council elections results map and data as the votes are countedLabour has emerged the biggest party in the devolved parliament in Wales with 30 seats - equalling its best-ever result. Though that is one seat short of an outright majority in the Senedd, First Minister Mark Drakeford said his party had exceeded expectations, with the results standing in contrast to the more dismal performance of Labour in English council elections and the Hartlepool by-election. The campaign in Wales had in large part focused on several north Wales battlegrounds such as the Vale of Clwyd, Delyn and Wrexham, constituencies that the Tories gained from Labour at Westminster in 2019.  No party has ever secured a majority in the Senedd since its establishment in 1999, although Labour has always been the largest party and has often fallen just short of the 31 votes needed to secure the body.  Meanwhile London is getting closer to knowing who will be its next mayor, as the count across the capital continues.Sadiq Khan of Labour is running for re-election, with polls in the final days of the campaign indicating he has a firm lead over Shaun Bailey, his Conservative opponent.The final result from the election may not be clear until Saturday afternoon at the earliest due in part to the voting system used in the capital.Londoners have indicated both a first and second preference for mayor on their ballots, with counting set to begin on 7am on Friday.If no candidate gets at least 50 per cent of first preference votes, all but the top two candidates are eliminated, and counting of second preference votes begins.Aside from their next mayor, residents of the capital cast their vote in London Assembly elections. The 25-member body is part of the Greater London Authority and scrutinises the activities of the mayor. Currently Labour is the biggest party in the body with 12 seats, followed by the Conservatives on eight, the Green party on two, Brexit Alliance on two and the Liberal Democrats on one.Labour have been the largest party in the Assembly since 2012. Dominating the early results from the May 6 election was the by-election Hartlepool, which has now turned blue for the first time since it was created, in turn punching another hole in the Red Wall. In an historic defeat for Labour, Hartlepool voted for the Tory candidate, Jill Mortimer, by 15, 529 votes to Labour’s 8,589, meaning she will now take up a seat as an MP in Westminster. The fallout from the result has circled chiefly around Mr Starmer, who has faced bitter disappointment within his own party over the loss of a core seat. The defeat is the worst result for Labour in what has consistently been a heartland for the party since the constituency was formed in 1974.Many additional elections took place on Thursday, including 39 police and crime commissioners in England. These elected officials are responsible for scrutinising chief police officers in their area, as well as setting the priorities of each force. There are also 12 other directly elected mayors on the ballot outside of London, with races in the West Midlands and West of England.Successfully keeping his city hall seat blue was Andy Street, a former chief executive of John Lewis who has been the West Midlands mayor since 2017. He won the seat against the odds when Labour dominated four of the seven councils, and has now beaten Liam Byrne, a former Cabinet minister under Gordon Brown, in the second round of votes. In Greater Manchester, Labour\u0027s Andy Burnham appears to have capitalised on his robust defence of the city against local restrictions imposed by Westminster, winning over two thirds of the vote in his bids for e-election.In West Yorkshire, the combined authority – which brings together York, Leeds and Bradford, amongst others – is voting for a mayor for the first time.Our results data are provided by the Press Association.

It could be glorious on a sunny day with all the cafes.”I asked her if Brexit was also an important issue. She looked at me with pitying puzzlement. “No my dear. Boris got Brexit done, remember? It’s time to prosper and move on.” It was a sentiment I heard again and again in Hartlepool, in the run-up to Thursday’s election. Not rage, but a weariness. Not anti-Remain spite but pro-Leave pride. Not fanatical despondency, but pragmatic hope. The metropolitan Left’s theory goes that Hartlepool is merely a belated Leaver rebellion – the Tories would have won the seat in 2019 anyway, had Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not split the vote. With this option removed, one-issue voters have been pulled by the gravity of their dismally simple logic towards the Tories. Such an analysis sums up the liberal Left’s take on the current state of British politics: that the Red Wall is in the grips of a naive and temporary rebellion. That its inhabitants, who seethe with a sort of philistine adolescence, are both short-sighted and hold long grudges. That the working-class’s deviant tryst with Tory predators will still all end in tears and, when the whole Brexit thing is forgotten, they will soon come crawling back.This narrative is as incorrect as it is offensive. Labour candidate Paul Williams not only failed to win back Brexit Party supporters who turned against his party at the last election his share of the vote actually plummeted nine points compared with 2019. This is a profound development. In theory, Labour should have been able to leverage Teeside’s historic anti-Thatcher tribalism to win back Brexit Party voters. In theory, practicing GP Dr Williams should have been able to rally the working-class in reverence of the NHS sacred cow. But the old rules no longer apply. They are as redundant as old Labour tropes about bourgeois Tory sleaze and posh Etonian scum. With voters no longer voting along traditional class lines, the old certainties no longer apply.One certainty, however, is that Tory Jill Mortimer’s victory in Hartlepool cannot be put down simply to Brexit. On the campaign trail, I raised it again and again with locals, who looked nonplussed. Some even seemed actively irritated at the political bubble’s obsession. As an ice cream vendor explained to me with strained patience: “We asked them to do Brexit and they did it. Now we’ve got more important things to think about, like a pandemic.” When the Liberal Democrat candidate assured me that he had only heard it raised once on the doorstep, I believed him. Resentment against Labour in places like Hartlepool is much bigger than Brexit. Its scathing, unfocused quality should deeply worry the Left: accusations that Labour and its “nasty corrupt councillors” had “taken Hartlepool for granted” were abundant, peppered with snorts of dismay at Keir Starmer taking the knee. Not that Hartlepudlians are born-again Tories. I met many who still bristle at the harshness of Thatcher. They are suspicious of the Tory machine’s refusal to field a local candidate. They are not wholly convinced that Westminster Tories really have the commercial skill and grassroots knowledge to redevelop their town. In the end, though, the rejection of modern Labour has proved more powerful than historic suspicion of the Tories.In other words, the Tory Hartlepool landslide is the first major sign that what we are witnessing across the “Red Wall” is not a temporary revolt but a potentially permanent revolution against Labour in its former heartlands. Labour’s demise in such areas is not down to a single event. Nor can it be blamed on its policies, or even Keir Starmer’s bland leadership. Clinging to Brexit as a comfort blanket to avoid this harsh reality will not do. The estrangement is cultural. Labour simply no longer emotionally connects with its former core. Despite strenuously avoiding the subject of Brexit, the party radiates a mystified disdain for ordinary people. Its woke membership think patriotism is a dangerous Middle English fundamentalism. Its bourgeois MPs regard towns that brim with potential, such as Hartlepool, as “left behind” cesspits. The hard-Left continues to blame its defeats on the depthless selfishness of the electorate. Keir Starmer’s attempts to change voter opinion has proved in vain. They can smell the insincerity of his attempt to embrace flag waving and veterans. Something deeper still is detectable – a sense that Labour no longer knows not only how to connect with people but with the age. Their demise across the North East and the Midlands is beginning to seem redolent of the strange death of Liberal England in the first quarter of the 20th century.With the enfranchisement of the working class, decline of empire and destruction of the First World War, liberal values – freedom, free trade, progress – suddenly seemed quaintly ancient as the writer George Dangerfield put it: nothing more than bits of old iron, fragments of intimate crockery, and other relics of a domestic past. Today, with the rise of consumerism, an impatiently ambitious lower-middle class, and international volatility, Labour values of class solidarity and corporate globalism seem cloyingly anachronistic.The Liberals ultimately disintegrated because the man they spoke to no longer existed. Labour has a similar problem: the flat-capped, unionised working class is a thing of the past. Centre-groundish Mondeo man is, it turns out, a culturally conservative patriot.Perhaps then it isn’t hyperbolic to talk of a historic realignment in British politics. One senses that, just as Labour is yet to reach rock bottom, we are yet to fully grasp the profundity of their crisis.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ardern isnt lovely have believe","story":"From the moment she entered office in 2017, the international coverage of Jacinda Ardern has been nothing short of slavering. Ardern is a female political leader at a time when sections of the press still talk about this like women politicians are unicorns. A year later she added to that advantage by giving birth while in office, which was reported on as though giving birth while holding down a job is unheard of. Coverage has continued in the same vein ever since, helped by the fact that her more important public statements are delivered with lashings of forced empathy. But those of us who are allergic to such bogus forms of communication and who judge people by their actions rather than their capabilities at emoting are noticing that increasingly, Ardern’s behaviour stinks.Last month her oh-so-progressive government made an unprecedented step. It refused to join a Five-Eyes statement which was critical of the Chinese Communist Party. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network (the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) is the world’s most successful and important intelligence-sharing partnership.In being a member of it New Zealand is at an extraordinary advantage – an advantage that far outweighs the miniscule resources it actually puts into intelligence or other defence capabilities.But the refusal was not an oversight by the Ardern government. Rather it was a part of a disgraceful and pro-totalitarian political turn. Ardern’s foreign affairs minister Nanaia Mahuta said that New Zealand now has a preference for moving on from the Five Eyes alliance and looking for new ‘multilateral opportunities’. Except no such better opportunities exist for such a small and isolated power. What is going on is that sweet, lovely Jacinda Ardern and her government are in the process of seeking as much Chinese investment as possible to boost their economy, and doing everything that the CCP wants to ensure that the investment roars in.Well here’s a tip. It can’t be done. You’re either in favour of forced labour camps, neo-colonialism and forced abortions on women who are nine months pregnant, or you’re not. Ardern perhaps hopes that we’ll glide over these awkward facts. And the international press might well. On Wednesday, the New Zealand Prime Minister announced with wonderful timing that she and her partner have set a ‘summer wedding’ date. So yay. Sweet Ardern is back.

This method decimated fish stocks by setting off electric pulses in the ocean.These boats have been licenced by the Marine Management Organisation, which says it will monitor the situation to see if there are impacts on fish stocks.In a letter to Defra, the fishermen said this is not acceptable. They wrote: We have concerns regarding the clear increase in the presence of very large and powerful fly shooters that are being seen increasingly in our western waters.We have received an increasing number of calls over the last couple of years with regard to the fishing effort and impacts of these vessels in the eastern Channel, especially with regard to non quota stocks. It does appear from our perspective that their presence in western waters is something of the marine equivalent of a land grab and this has not been helped by the reported lack of data on the number of vessels using this method of fishing and their catches, either historically or presently.They have asked for the licences to be reviewed, pointing out that the new Fisheries Act gives the UK the power to provide or deny access to our waters based on the social and economic benefits of inidual vessel operations to our own coastal communities.Mr Percy added: The under ten fleet in the UK has been hanging on by its fingertips for years, increasingly reliant on fewer and fewer species, hemmed in by everyone from the EU fleet parked on our 6 mile line to increased calls for inshore MPA’s, licences capped, promises of a fair allocation of quota broken time and again, a draconian licencing regime and yet more restrictions on those few species that we are allowed to catch.Yet a fleet of hugely impactful, foreign owned vessels that provide next to no social, economic or environmental benefits to our coastal communities are licenced to fish in our waters whilst the powers that be decide on longer term access.

At some point it may become unviable to grow them, she and other horticulturists and scientists at Kew believe.Traditional potatoes are becoming very hard to grow because of blight, she said.Two strange-looking, knobbly little roots are being trialed instead, as they fare better in a warm climate and are resistant to blight.The gardener explained: We have been trying to grow root vegetables that could be substituted in the future. One we grow is oculus tuberosa, and tropaeolum tuberosum - the former is a little lemony root, it does really well, we are breeding it in the UK to make it more suitable for our climate. We also have a mustardy root crop, and sweet potatoes are doing well as well. They could be a replacement. We won’t know for tens of years but we have to start somewhere.Many who tried to grow lettuces during last year\u0027s heatwave will have noticed it was an uphill battle. These hot summers are becoming more common, so Ms Dove is working to find hardier alternatives to the salad crop.She said: Lettuces bolt when it gets hot so we may not be able to grow them in hot dry summers. We are growing tropical leaves, orache, tree spinach, they are traditionally grown for their grain but the leaves are edible so they sort of replace spinach. We are also growing dandelion which have really bitter but delicious leaves. They will keep growing through anything. We are trialling all this for salad in the kitchen garden. Another new way of gardening she is experimenting with is container planting, for those who do not have vegetable patches but want to grow their own food.In the kitchen garden, she is growing a new breed of butternut squash which can fit in a pot, and a mini peach tree which will produce a handful of fruits each year.Ms Dove explained: The windowsill crops and container planting are a real trend at the moment - we are developing butternut squashes you can grow in a pot - usually they need a lot of room but these work in a pot. We are in conversation with people to get smaller cultivars to try to get crops that often need a lot of space. I am trialling dwarf peaches and dwarf nectarines that can be grown in a pot. I have this beautiful little tree that will give me 10 peaches this year.

These platforms are seeing that and saying there are these people on our platform and we need to be catering towards them,” she said.Ampere said programming designed for older audiences included Netflix’s The 39 Steps, an adaptation of John Buchan’s 1915 thriller starring Benedict Cumberbatch, and an upcoming documentary about the serial killer Dennis Nilsen.Crime and thrillers, dramas, and documentaries, the three genres where audiences are most skewed towards over-35s, made up almost half of commissions from services including Netflix and Amazon.Horror, romance and reality made up less than 15 per cent. “These audiences have traditionally been linear TV’s core viewers,” Ampere said.The BBC has been instructed to appeal to younger tastes amid fears it faces losing a generation of viewers that could threaten its place in public life. Two in five streaming viewers have said they can imagine watching no broadcast television in five years, according to Ofcom.Abi Watson, of media researcher Enders Analysis, said that streaming services were also turning to older viewers as demand among younger ones became saturated.“The opportunity to drive up new subscribers in the under-35s bracket is small,” she said. “Older adults also tend to be later adopters of new technologies. Given how long streaming has been around now, it’s not surprising that the streamers are starting to pick up traction in this age group.”Ofcom’s annual report on the BBC in November found that satisfaction levels among viewers aged 55 and over had declined in 2020.However, it also found that the broadcaster was continuing to struggle to reach young audiences. It said that 87 per cent of the population use BBC services, a decline from 92 per cent three years earlier.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"outgoing royal opera house chairman didnt immediately inform","story":"The outgoing chairman of the Royal Opera House did not tell his board about his private decision to buy its painting by David Hockney when it was auctioned for millions of pounds, The  can disclose.David Ross, one of Britain’s biggest philanthropists, surprised the arts world last weekend when it emerged he is standing down just nine months into his four-year term as chairman of the Royal Opera House.He now plans to continue in a second term at the National Portrait Gallery, which he also chairs.  His reported departure  – which has not yet been officially confirmed – was seen as unusual, particularly because he personally intervened to save the Royal Opera House from ruin by buying the Hockney painting of the institution’s former boss Sir David Webster for £11 million, plus buyer’s premium, last November. Now it has emerged that Mr Ross privately acquired the painting but chose not to inform the institution’s trustees  (he was not legally required to) causing some surprise on the board, which comprises some of the great and the good from the British arts world.  The sale of the Hockney had been part of the Opera House’s four-pronged plan for financial recovery set at the height of the pandemic. The sale was agreed in principle last July – just before Mr Ross became chairman – and was sent to auction in October. The board was only told the name of the buyer in November. The painting, which is now owned by Mr Ross, is currently in storage and will be hung in time for the new season.  Asked if the Opera House knew that Mr Ross was the buyer of the picture when it was sold at auction, a spokesman said: No”.  Friends of Mr Ross said he had informed the Opera House within the required time about his secret purchase of the painting.  They said that he had decided to step in anonymously to buy the painting at auction to “save it for the nation” because he was worried that it would be sold to a foreign buyer.  However, sources in the arts world said that this had caused some disappointment among some trustees who had hoped that he was going to make a separate substantial donation, in addition to any proceeds for the sale of the painting.Trustees of the Royal Opera House, based in Covent Garden, central London, are expected to donate a proportion of their earnings to the charity. One senior source at the Opera House who is close to Mr Ross claimed that he could have been more open about his intentions regarding the Hockney.  The source told The : “There may be things that he might wish he had communicated differently or done differently but his intentions were good.”  The Opera House denied that Mr Ross’s appointment as chairman had been “conditional” in his making a separate substantial donation.  A spokesman said: “David\u0027s appointment was not conditional on a donation, although he has subsequently pledged.”  Mr Ross, who made his fortune as the co-founder of high street chain Carphone Warehouse, is now planning to move the painting to the National Portrait Gallery when it reopens after a refurbishment in 2023.  Friends of Mr Ross said the painting will “remain available to the public” and will be on display either at the Opera House or the National Portrait Gallery “for the foreseeable future”.  The friend added: “He has since pledged to give money to the Royal Opera House because for every single charity he has ever chaired or been involved with he has given extremely generous donations to.”  Mr Ross is now hoping ministers will ask him to stay on at the National Portrait Gallery to ensure that pictures, paintings and portraits with links to the UK’s colonial past are rehung, and not left in the store room because of any controversial content.  The friend added: “David is passionate about making our arts and culture accessible to all so that we can all learn from our country’s history.  “We should be extremely proud about the many achievements of earlier generations but we must also seek to understand where they got things wrong.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"treat loved ones like hostages beg family british citizens detained","story":"When Iranian media reported last week that Britain was about to settle a £400 million debt in exchange for release of prisoners held in Iran, the mood in Anoosheh Ashoori\u0027s cell in Tehran\u0027s Evin prison rose.There was a sense of massive excitement in the prison ward. It was like a spark of hope among the prisoners, said Sherry Izadi, his wife. I had to tell him on the phone that both sides had denied it, but that didn\u0027t seem to deter him.Mr Ashoori, a 67-year-old London businessman, is one of several British-Iranian prisoners whose families say are being held hostage to force Britain to settle the decades-old debt from a botched arms deal.The suggestion that a quid-pro-quo was finally being sought brought them a sense of excitement - it is the only way he and other prisoners, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, believe they will get home.But it also provoked a furious debate between those who believe Britain should pay off the debt the Ministry of Defence company International Military Services acknowledges it owes, and those who fear it will  simply encourage Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps to take more hostages.For the families of the detained, the debate has brought out another certainty - that the entire case has been deeply mishandled.“Empirically, the government needs to look  at its hostage policy. I have not seen any honest recounting about what works and what doesn’t,” said Richard Ratcliffe, Nazanin\u0027s husband. “The British approach - the idea we don’t pay ransoms - well it is only since the 1970s we’ve not done it. It is ideological. It is not like we are looking at what does and what doesn’t work.”One of the families’ main frustrations is that the governments involved will not officially acknowledge that the issue is a hostage crisis rather than a consular dispute.James Cleverly, the minister for the Middle East, said it was completely inappropriate to link the detention of British nationals to the debt. They are separate issues, one massively predates the other.Iranian diplomatic sources also insist that there is no link between the prisoners and the IMS debt, saying charges against Mrs Ratcliffe, Mr Ashoori, and the others are purely a matter for the judiciary.Both sides have an interest in this denial.  The hostages’ side cannot be seen to be paying a ransom, lest it encourage more hostage taking.  For the hostage-taking side, minimising the embarrassment makes it easier for the money to be paid.For the Ratcliffes and the Ashooris, such dissemblance is utterly infuriating.Mr Ratcliffe says his wife has been told told quite explicitly that if she wants to go home, the UK must settle the tank debt.Last month a hearing on the IMS debt case at the London high court was postponed at the eleventh hour, apparently at Iran\u0027s request.That could be a sign that an out of court settlement is being negotiated. But one week later an Iranian court handed Mrs Zaghari Ratcliffe a new sentence. The timing, her husband believes, was no mistake. Mrs Izadi says her husband was more obliquely informed about a link between his case and the debt by an anonymous stranger in the early stages of his detention in Tehran. “So we began digging, and we cannot find any other explanation for his detention,” she said.And keeping quiet has not worked. “We were quiet for two years and nothing happened. Two years is ample time for diplomacy to work if it is the correct diplomacy,” said Sherry Izadi.“However it is resolved I think it is definitely something the FCO has to consider for the future. A form of policy has to be put in place for to prevent or to provide a clear outline for how the should be dealt with, she added. Paying off the debt in a direct trade off is not universally popular.Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, compared it to Aethelred the Unready’s successive attempts to buy peace with viking invaders.“Paying for hostages leads to... more hostages,” he wrote on Twitter “We\u0027ve tried that policy before. At first we called it Danegeld - the gold we had to pay the Danes to stop them raiding Britain. When the policy had failed completely, we stopped calling it Danegeld and simply called it tax.”But Mr Ratcliffe and Mrs Izadi are both unimpressed with such arguments.Firstly, they point out, the Iranian demand is for a debt that Britain acknowledges it should pay. As far as they are concerned, a British tussle with a known hostage-taking regime placed their relatives in danger.Secondly, says Mr Ratcliffe, refusing to pay simply has not deterred further hostage taking. Since his wife was arrested at Tehran airport in 2016, at least  three more Britons have been detained: Mr Ashoori in 2017,  Morad Tahbaz, the co-founder of the Persian Wildlife Heritage foundation, in 2018, and Mehran Raoof, a labour rights activist, in 2020. The  understands there are several more whose families have chosen to remain anonymous.“It is an international market, he said. They specifically want something off the Brits. But they also hold nationals from all across the world, so the logic becomes: ok the Brits not pay, but if we squeeze the British prisoners then the Spanish or French will pay up to avoid that. You just play a different role.”Thirdly, the unpalatable truth is that hostage situations usually end with the Danegeld being paid, in one way or another.In 2016, the US government flew $400 million in cash to Iran in what is widely viewed as an unacknowledged ransom payment for the release for four US citizens.Mr Ratcliffe argues that the sensible approach would be to pay the money to get your prisoners out, then extort a deterrent cost  to stop it from happening again - rather as Somali piracy was overcome by putting armed guards on ships.But to do that, says Mr Ratcliffe, the British government needs to call a spade a spade - and call out hostage diplomacy for what it is.Without doubt the interest of the family are different from the British government, said Mr Ratcliffe. My interest is to keep Nazanin safe. We have been taken as collateral in their dispute.

The pandemic squeezed the politics out of the campaign with people in forgiving mood towards the Government following last year’s bad mistakes. Freshly vaccinated voters were showing little anger, just a desire to pull together and get through it all. I say little anger, butI am honest, where I did detect this, it was directed more at Labour than the government. As I revisited areas where I used to receive strong political support, I was told that Labour had lost its way. What do you think  Have your say below Jeremy Corbyn still casts a long shadow. A woman voter in Chaucer Avenue told me: “I cannot believe I am telling you this but I voted Tory because of Corbyn.” When I told her Keir Starmer is very dferent, she snapped back: “You will have to prove it – you can earn my vote before I come back.” There was more like this. The message was clear: Labour needs to get its act together. Locally too, they were disillusioned with Labour councillors who were aloof from them, speaking a language that owed more to far-left platitudes than their everyday lives.  Despite the disappointment of the by-election loss, we are now going to see the re-building of Labour’s reputation locally, and similar fightbacks are taking place in many former Labour strongholds as Starmer supporters gain the upper hand over Corbyn’s army of zealots. ButI take away one abiding impression, it is that in towns like Hartlepool the political kaleidoscope has turned and Labour is not going to recover by attempting to bring back the past. A new model Labour party is being demanded by voters, who themselves have moved on.  In smart and proud former council houses now occupied by their owners, voters want a Labour party that understands their aspiration, believes in social justice, knows this has to be paid for and will ensure that fair rules apply to all – from hard-working welfare recipients to the rich and privileged. They want to be heard, not talked down to, and they want to get behind policies they feel are genuinely useful and relevant to improving their lives. Labour has not spoken to these voters for over a decade since Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were prime ministers.

Thanks, though, to all the people who covered this column and to lots of you for the many nice messages. I won’t bore you with details. I ­always think other people’s illness is something you don’t really want to hear about – like other people’s ­holidays, bolognese recipes, or kids. Nice to be back. Quite a week. I could tell by the increasingly frantic phone calls from Labour folk that the election results were going to be nightmarish. It’s hard to predict how bad this is going to be. As Custer said at Little Bighorn when the first arrow landed: “Lads, I don’t really fancy this one.” Wales was a decent result but bad news in the West Midlands, the south-east, the north-east. Pretty much ­everywhere, really. Scotland is still being counted, as I write, but doesn’t look too clever for Labour. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section But it’s the Hartlepool result that dominates the postmortem – “shattering”, as one Labour figure summed it up, being about right. Peter Mandelson was on the radio trying to put his finger on what had gone wrong for the party. Aside from the “two Cs” as he put it – Corbyn and Covid- – the main problem, he thought, seemed to boil down to the fact that he’s not running the show. Beyond that, he seemed to struggle. “I’ve been in and out of Hartlepool for four weeks,” he insisted, “going house-to-house meeting ­people.” I think we’ve identied the problem. I can’t think of anything more unwelcome going door-to-door. Except Ebola. This kind of lack of awareness permeates Labour at present. Mandelson appeared amazed that the Hartlepool plan of sending in a Remain candidate, from outside the area and armed with little or no policy, didn’t quite come off. “But he’s a doctor,” said one Labour ­campaigner.

It’s not necessarily a vote-winner. Labour is going to have to take some serious remedial action. It can’t go on as it has been, blindly following the old ways when the nation – and the Tory party – are busy changing. What’s ominous has been the reaction so far. I’ve had phone calls in the immediate ­aftermath from three dferent Labour factions, each blaming the other lot for what’s gone wrong. The electorate don’t want that kind of stuff. These are uncertain times and they want a Labour Party they can be sure of – not bickering and endless infighting. But the internal war will rumble on – more finger-pointing, and in the end a shadow cabinet reshuffle. All window dressing.

At a time when the nation desperately needs an alternative to its current shambles of an immoral Government, Keir Starmer’s party has been given a pummelling in the polls. Voters have delivered a stark warning. Labour is just not working for them in its traditional heartlands. The loss of Hartlepool, Labour since its creation half a century ago, defeats in council elections everywhere but the metrolands of Manchester and London are a reckoning for a party that has lost touch with its own purpose. Le-long supporters have given up hope that it is any longer a champion for them. At the same time it is failing to attract new voters in a changing world. What do you think  Have your say in comments below.  It is not all Keir Starmer’s fault. But neither is it simplistically down to “Covid and Corbyn”, as some have said. Support has been seeping away for years, culminating at the last election in the worst Labour result since . It is, however, Starmer’s responsibility to get the party into shape to have a chance of winning again, ever. In that, he has failed in his first year of leadership. Labour now needs clear, concrete policies. It needs an identity. It is never going to outdo the Tories by being over-cautious and invisible. It cannot afford another round of internal warfare. It must unite or die. Extinction for political parties is not unprecedented in British history, as the demise of the once dominant Liberals shows. Labour is already wiped out in Scotland. It has no purposeit cannot win elections. Sir Keir is right to say there is a mountain to climb. It’s time he struck out for base camp.

The West of England and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral elections both bucked the trend as Conservatives were ousted. Labouraposs Dan Norris was elected West of England mayor, beating Tory candidate Samuel Williams by , votes to ,. And Labouraposs Nik Johnson narrowly won the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoralty from Tory incumbent James Palmer, by a margin of , votes to , in the second round. Mr Johnson scored an astonishing % improvement in vote share compared to  - leapfrogging the Lib Dems from Labouraposs third-place finish last time. Labour aides were left pleasantly surprised at the strength of the two gains in southern England, despite losing more than  council seats - many of them across the Midlands and north - and the Hartlepool by-election. Despite the torrid results in parts of England Labour did much better than expected in Wales, retaining control of the Welsh Parliament under Welsh leader Mark Drakeford. And in Scotland Labour notched up almost the same vote share as the Tories in overall constituency results, at %. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham boosted Labouraposs vote share by % while Sadiq Khan was on course to be ed as London mayor despite initial jitters.Mr Norris praised Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer after the results were declared at the SS Great Britain in Bristol on Saturday.Without him and his skills, his determination and him being who he is, we could not have got this result, he said. People were able to listen to our arguments and be persuaded by them because of Keir Starmer. I want to thank him very, very much indeed.  But the results, ironically, rolled in just as Labour headed into meltdown with Sir Keiraposs sacking of party chair Angela Rayner. It is the first move in a brutal reshuffle by Sir Keir, who said barely  hours ago that he would take responsibility for the results. It sparked a wave of recriminations among MPs - one of whom branded the sacking utterly idiotic. Ms Rayner was a stalwart of the Corbyn era but also had broad support from Labouraposs base - winning double the votes of her nearest rival for deputy leader. And despite Sir Keiraposs decision Ms Rayner remains his deputy - as that role is elected by party members. That means she will still wield considerable influence on the party and have a public profile.

The West Midlands mayoral race piled on the agony for Labour as reigning mayor Andy Street was comfortably re-elected in the crucial contest.

The results are not all rosy for the Tories - whose vote share in Scotland was actually down in early counting.

Labour lost a whopping  seats in traditional bellwether Nuneaton and Bedworth.

Only one of Walesapos so-called red wall seats, the Vale of Clwyd, fell to the Welsh Conservatives, and the party also unseated the former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda.

A ban outlawing the importing of the sick souvenirs is to be unveiled in the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday. Yet a loophole allows wealthy collectors to bring in tusks, skins and stuffed carcasses by paying tens of thousands for a “conservation exemption” to obtain special permits for hunts and imports. The cash is supposed to be used for conservation and community developments projects, mostly in Africa. But critics have slammed it as a cop-out and blasted hunters who pose with their kills as “beaming morons”.Claire Bass, director of the Humane Society International, said: “Allowing hunting trophies to be imported under a fig leaf of supposed conservation benefit would undermine the Government’s goal of having the strongest hunting trophy ban in the world. Whataposs your opinion on trophy hunting and the people who do it  Tell us in the comments below “To truly protect wildle we need a loophole-free ban, not a pay-to-slay.” The campaign group Ban Hunting Trophies has demanded evidence to show where the conservation of wildle has benefited from a version of the scheme in the US.Founder Eduardo Goncalves said: “Trophy hunting groups have brought pressure to make the law meaningless. The ‘blood money’ loophole allows the wealthy to kill and collect the world’s most endangered animals for kicks by arguing they are funding conservation. “Trophy hunters will be rubbing their hands in glee.

Yet these beaming morons are still charging around the world on a wild killing spree. “There are just , black rhinos left. It is over  years since a black rhino trophy entered Britain, yet this appalling blood money loophole will positively encourage wealthy hunters to shoot some of the last of these great animals.” Explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes said: “If hunters really want to conserve wildle, why don’t they just put down their guns and give the thousands they’d have spent on shooting defenceless animals to conservation projects instead ”Comedian Ricky Gervais added: “This loophole would be a serious flaw in a good law, allowing the richest hunters to continue under the nonsense cover of conservation. It is vital this does not get through.” And TV’s Carol Vorderman said: “This is not a rehearsal. So many species are under threat and only action right now, with no exceptions, no exemptions, no loopholes, will suffice.” In America, permits have been issued to hunt and import black rhino. Texan billionaire Lacy James Harber was famously pictured with one slain beast he had planned to take back to the US. And Michigan tycoon Chris D. Peyerk reportedly paid , to kill a rhino he intended to take home.UK opponents include Carrie Symonds, fiancée of PM Boris Johnson. She is head of communications for wildle charity the Aspinall Foundation and tweeted a campaigning Mirror front page when the law was announced – before the loophole was exposed.

Around a third of people with coronavirus show no symptoms, so can infect others without even knowing they’ve been ill. Rapid testing is a vital tool to make sure people know when to self isolate so they break the chain of transmission. Alex, , from Hemel Hempstead, works for JamVans, a removal company that provides Covid- tests for its employees. He was experiencing no symptoms at all when he tested positive for Covid. “We move people’s homes on a daily basis, and also have a delivery contract with a local hospice – it has about  charity stores, and we help them move all the stock,” says Alex. “One morning before work I did a rapid Covid- test outside the hospice, then sat in my van waiting for the results. I’d done a few of these tests, and thought it would be fine as I didn’t have a single symptom – but then the test came back positive.”  “I spoke to the hospice on the phone from outside the building, and they told me I had to go for a PCR test. My company booked me in with a private firm and I went straight there. Our company policy is that we have to wear a mask in people’s houses and throughout our offices, and I stick to the guidelines as much as I can, so at first I thought the rapid flow test must be wrong. But within an hour, I was told I definitely had Covid. I couldn’t quite believe it.” Alex was able to isolate straightaway, ensuring he wasn’t spreading Covid to any vulnerable people he came into contact with. “I stopped working to self-isolate on full pay, and still didn’t develop any symptoms at all,” he says. “Without the test, I definitely would have carried on working, which is why it’s so important to have regular tests, evenyou haven’t got any symptoms. I had the virus and I felt fine, but imagineI’d given it to my parents, my grandparents or my colleagues  “If I’m driving between  charity shops, with three or four people in each shop, I could have been quite a spreader. I would have put a lot of people at risk, who may not be as young and healthy as I am – you never know who you’re passing it on to. It might sound dramatic, but in my case, taking the test could have saved lives. I haven’t had the jab yet, but I will as soon as I can – and I’ll still be taking two tests a week.Get into the testing habit More than half the adults in the UK have had at least one dose of Covid vaccination and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. But the virus is still out there and around a third of all the people who are infected do not show any symptoms. Regular rapid testing is vital to break the chain of transmission – now all adults are advised to do two tests a week. Rapid testing kits are free and you can do them at home, with results appearing within just  minutes. If you test positive, you’ll be able to isolate straightaway rather than risk spreading Covid to others. Millions of people have already made regular home testing part of their routine, as secondary school children and their parents have been able get free tests since February, but now everyone is encouraged to play their part. Every test helps to put your mind at rest and helps protect people around you as the country moves out of lockdown. Around one in three people with coronavirus has no symptoms. Rapid Covid-tests are for people who aren’t showing symptoms. If you’re showing symptoms , order a PCR test. Test twice a week, or every three or four days: it’s the best way to catch a case of Covid- at the point it becomes highly infectious.If you test positive you should self-isolate immediately and visit nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a PCR test that will confirm the result.If you test negative, you must still follow the Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air rules to minimise the spread of Covid-. Rapid tests are easy to use and give results within  minutes. It’s important to report your results online straightaway, whether the test is positive, negative or even void. It’s easy to do at gov.uk report-covid-result or by calling .More than m rapid tests have been taken since October , and hundreds of thousands of positive cases among people with no symptoms have been picked up. Information from the rapid tests is kept anonymous, and scientists use it to spot patterns and outbreaks more quickly and accurately, helping to reduce the risk of future lockdowns. Even though you might have already had one or two doses of vaccine, there’s a chance you could still give Covid to someone , as no vaccine is  per cent effective. So it’s vital to test twice weekly as well as continuing to follow social distancing guidance, washing hands, wearing a face covering and letting fresh air in. Rapid Covid- tests are suitableyou have no symptoms of Covid .“Remember, around a third of people with coronavirus have no symptoms, but could be spreading it to others without knowing,” says GP Dr Amir Khan. “Rapid testing is effective at detecting people who are infectious and enabling us to find Covid- cases that we otherwise would not know about. This helps us in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Testing regularly even when you have no symptoms means we can keep infection levels low and our country safe, and the good thing is they give a result within  minutes.” And, as Dr Khan notes, the tests are very reliableyou do them correctly. “Testing ourselves for coronavirus using rapid Covid- tests is vital in keeping ourselves and others safe from coronavirus and keeping infection rates in our communities low.

And then he hit a gigantic pothole and his exhaust almost fell off. I don’t know who swore loudest, him or me – after I got a lapful of scalding coffee. But I sympathised as he inspected his vehicle, fearing more costly repairs from yet another pothole prang. He said that in his  years as a cabbie, in London and the Midlands, he has seen the nation’s highways going to hell. He feels ashe’s “navigating an assault course” each time he’s out and his stress is soaring. What do you think  Have your say in comments below Britain’s crumbling road network has been neglected for far too long, and we are in the grip of a pothole pandemic. The RAC says road surfaces have started to resemble “the surface of the Moon” and some  drivers a day need rescuing after hitting holes. Between January and March pothole-related breakdowns shot up %, despite fewer cars on the roads.  And the damage is costing motorists dear. Years of underfunding mean councils have a massive backlog of repairs and Britain’s , potholes have a combined depth of more than  miles. Lockdown was the ideal chance to get a grip. The Government boasted in February of allocating £million to councils, part of a five-year, £.billion deal. It hardly scratches the surface. Research suggests the true cost of the UK’s pothole problem is £bn. Councils insist they have been working hard to repair roads and are “filling a pothole every  seconds”. Like the one near me which has just been done for the second time in a year. And THAT is where the problem lies. Councils just patch up cracks as they appear – trapped in an endless game of whack-a-hole.

Russell Adey, , and we Kate, , were regulars at their local hostelry and visited with friends several times a week. But after nearly a year of lockdowns, they were missing their regular drinking hole and wanted a project to focus on to distract from mental health struggles. They decided to create a traditional pub in their garden which they have dubbed the Adey Arms. Russell pulled up part of the lawn at the bottom of their garden and laid slabs ready for a structure to be erected.What do you think  Have your say in comments belowThey then purchased a £, summer house, which they liken to a big shed, and it was delivered and put up in mid-March this year. The couple from Stourbridge, West Midlands, then painted the exterior and flooring, before insulating and plaster-boarding the walls. A local electrician install the electrics before the couple started the decorating process, hanging wallpaper and sourcing second-hand furniture.The bar, table, benches and log burner were made by a local carpenter, and the couple found the fridges, beer pumps and soft furnishings on eBay and Facebook Marketplace.No pub would be complete without its own merchandise, so they also ordered a sign for the door and personalised beer mats - all emblazoned with aposThe Adey Armsapos.  For extra fun, they added a projector and big screen for movie nights and football matches. The family-friendly garden pub has a table area for their children, Archie, , and nine-year-old Tilly. In total the couple spent £, and the pub was finished in mid-April, taking just four weeks to complete. We soon started missing the pub when lockdown started, and with home-schooling the kids my we was desperate for one, Russell, who works as a sales manager, said. Me and Kate were really suffering with our mental health during lockdown and decided we needed a project of some sort to focus our energies on, that would be fun to do and could be a lasting reminder of how important our friends and family are to us. The fact we werenapost able to see them all had really hit home to us, so we decided to build our own pub. Once the idea was in place, Kate started a mood board and they got to work designing the whole thing. Russell said: We were adamant that we wanted to buy local and source everything from local businesses, or recycle by buying second-hand things - which would keep the cost down as well. Businesses had suffered so much with the pandemic so we wanted to give something back and try and do our bit for the local community. Once completed, the pub was spacious enough to have three separate seating areas - tall stools, a corner table to seat six and a miniature table and stools for the kids. The family opted for classic pub decor, with exposed brick wallpaper, wooden finishes and even traditional features including stuffed animal heads.  In a fun twist, they also framed a picture of the Queen covered in tattoos. After finishing installing and decorating the pub, the family were inseparable from their new watering hole. Russell said: The bar was finished in mid-April and we have been in it ever since.We have a coffee machine and soft drinks so weaposre not always drinking alcohol.Now we have the pub I canapost see us going back to our old haunt. The drinks are cheaper and we now have everything we need at the bottom of the garden, so thereaposs no need to go anywhere . We also donapost need a designated driver anymore as we can just stumble up to the house. Our family absolutely love it in there - it saved us during lockdown at a time where there didnapost seem to be anything to look forward to. We are so proud of it and what it represents. The couple are hoping to share their new space with loved ones as soon as possible. Russell said: We canapost wait to invite people round to enjoy it with us as soon as restrictions are lted.

Keith Hurworth, , is one of  patients who contracted Mycobacterium Abscessus at the Royal Papworth Hospital – one of whom died. The bug, which is found in infected water, stays in the body and can attack the lungs and eat into bones. Keith, who was in hospital for a double lung transplant, has been told there is no cure or effective treatment for it. Andhis new lungs fail, the bug prevents him having a second transplant. The dad-of-two now wants to know why he was admitted for his op five months after the world-famous Royal Papworth declared a serious incident. Tell us what you think of this story in the comments below The infection was found in the hospital’s water supply soon after it moved to a site next to nearby Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. Keith says he was not told about the bug before his double transplant in February . Five lung transplant patients were infected, and  people with serious lung conditions. The bug was first identied in August  and a serious incident was declared by the NHS Trust the following month.  But Keith says the first he knew about the problem was last May, when a doctor told him he was infected. Keith, from Cotgrave, near Nottingham, said: “I owe my le to Papworth but I don’t understand why they didn’t tell me. “When doctors told me I was infected, they were in tears. Everyone was so upset. I deserved to know there had been this bug in the water.” Married Keith, who is dad to Liam, , and Libby, , is now taking legal action.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

I was given the gt of le and I feel like I owe it to the person who I got the lungs from to get solicitors involved. “Otherwise it feels like the lungs have been wasted.” Keith worked with cement and suffered breathing problems for years. He learned he had been infected when he went for a post-op check-up. He added: “It was devastating for me, my we and the children. I’ve been told I can’t have another transplant because once the infection is in your body, not a lot can be done.  “The bug is sitting dormant at the moment. But when it starts up, I might have only months to live. “The only drug is one that slows it down. That this outbreak has not just affected me but others as well is worrying. My family feel very upset and angry. I feel a terrible conflict in going to lawyers, but I wasn’t told about the bug. I am trying to understand why. “I deserve to knowmore could have been done to prevent me falling ill.”  Keith was also put through the wringer by Covid but a steroid drug saved his le. Clare Pearson, of lawyers Irwin Mitchell, said: “This has had a major impact on Keith and caused great concern among other patients. While we welcome the fact the Trust identied areas for future action, it is worrying that Keith contracted his infection six months after the first cases were identied.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i want meet cannibal who","story":"NewsI want to meet cannibal who killed my sister and ate her leg so I can look him in eyesEXCLUSIVE: Michael Paterson aims to sit down with David Harker after he strangled Julie Paterson, , in  and ate her leg in a scene police likened to Silence of the LambsmirrorShareCommentsByDan WarburtonReporter for the Sunday Mirror and People:,  MAY NewsMurder victim Julie Patersons leg was eaten by cannibal David Harker\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Michael Paterson aims to sit down face-to-face with David Harker as part of the restorative justice programme. Harker strangled Julie Paterson, , in  and ate her leg in a scene police likened to Silence of the Lambs, in which Sir Anthony Hopkins played killer Hannibal Lecter. For more than two decades Harker has refused to reveal what he did with other body parts – even taunting his victim’s family from prison with cruel notes. Grieving Michael, , told the Sunday People: “I want to go to prison, look Harker in the eyes, and demand to know what he did with my sister. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section “I can’t move on with my le until I know. He is sick. I want him to tell me what he did with Julie’s body so I can move on with my le. He shouldn’t be released until that happens.” Harker, then aged , pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Julie in Darlington on the grounds of diminished responsibility. A judge at Teesside crown court sentenced him to le imprisonment with a recommendation that he should not be eligible for parole for at least  years.  But he could be freeda parole board deems he is no longer a risk. However, Michael claims Harker “prevented the lawful and decent burial” of his sister, a mother of four. And he intends to lodge a complaint with police which he hopes could spark a fresh investigation and prolong Harker’s time in prison – unless he reveals what he did with Julie’s remains. Her family raised the possibility of quizzing Harker after prison chiefs included details of the rehab process in an information pack.  No cannibal has ever been involved in a restorative justice meeting. Any summit could be part of a new parole bid – but Harker will have to agree to the meeting. A source said: “It would clearly need to be a highly secure meeting.  Harker’s crimes were unspeakable.” Restorative justice is aimed at helping victims and perpetrators. It involves offenders and people affected by the crime quizzing each other in an effort to move forward with their lives – and prevent further crimes.

She passed one stone but the second got stuck in her kidney and she got inflammation of the kidneys, so they gave her a large amount of antibiotics and lots of pain killers. In the end, they took her to emergency theatre to put a stent in, which opens up the drainage from the kidney and they got the stone out.

It was just after Christmas that she had the stent removed and then she started vomiting, she just couldnapost keep any food down, nothing was passing through her stomach and over the last three years itaposs just gotten worse and worse.

Craig Walding said before the Covid pandemic he saw nothing wrong with placing an occasional bet when watching the football at the weekend. But just a few years later, what was then an occasional flutter had become an online gambling addiction that left the NHS worker contemplating taking his own le. After becoming addicted to online casino games in March last year, he lost £, in the space of a month, losing half of that in just one night.With his support networks cut off as the country went into lockdown, Craig spiralled, with his losses leading him to take out payday loans, Wales Online reports.He also had to borrow money from friends and family. After losing that money too, he found himself in massive debt, and contemplated taking his own le.Thankfully, he reached out for help, and has begun to now overcome his addiction after being treated by Cardf -based support service Footsteps to Recovery. As he now prepares for a charity boxing match to raise money for those who saved him, Craig, , of Whitchurch, has reflected on what was the lowest period of his le.However, in March , Craig lost all control over his gambling, as the nationwide lockdown pushed him into spending more time playing online casino games.  “Things got really, really bad,” recalled Craig. “I live on my own, and all my coping mechanisms - going to the gym, seeing friends, having plans - were taken away and I was constantly on screens instead. “There were lots of adverts everywhere, especially on social media, and companies were sending out promotional emails when lockdown started. “I remember one company was offering a free £ bet because of the pandemic - at the time I obviously thought that was great, but looking back now I can’t believe how awful that is. “I had never really struggled with my mental health before, but then I felt unstable and everything got completely out of control.”  Having sold his flat in January  and moved into temporary shared accommodation while he looked for a new house, Craig had put money into a savings account and he “felt like he had a plan”. But as his addiction consumed his le, these plans began to disappear, along with the eye-watering amounts of money he was staking. In the space of a month, Craig lost around £, - all of his savings - as he spent all day playing on multiple online casino s - with his most costly night seeing him lose £, on a casino game. Not knowing what to do next, he began borrowing money from his friends and family - none of whom knew anything about his addiction - and took out some “awful” payday loans in the hope of making the money back. But after gambling and losing this money as well, a devastated Craig “hit the depths of depression”, as he fell into £, worth of debt across his overdraft, credit cards and loans.  “I was a train wreck,” he said. “I was shut off, I was drinking more, I felt so down, so hopeless and so ashamed - I didn’t want to tell anyone, not even my family. “I never thought I’d ever even consider suicide, but I was so deep in this hole that I just didn’t know what  to do, I couldn’t see a way out. “Getting into all that debt, I couldn’t pay my rent or my bills, and my plans were ruined. I knew at that point, I was either going to end things or I had to reach out for help. I decided to do the latter, thank God.” In , research commissioned by UK gambling charity GambleAware, found that problem gamblers like Craig were six times more likely to have suicidal thoughts or try to take their own le, and could be  times more likely to do so. After deciding enough was enough, Craig confessed all to his family and friends, which he described as “the lowest moment of all.” “I spoke to my dad about it, which was the most dficult conversation I’ve ever had,” he said. “I’d never seen him cry before, but we both were. He couldn’t believe what had happened. “I also told everything to my brother and a few of my friends, and that’s when things started to improve.”  Having heard about his struggle, a good friend of Craig’s told him that he should contact Footsteps to Recovery, a Cardf-based support service provided by Pobl, which offers treatment and support for those suffering from addiction.

An interview which formed part of the documentary heard an emotional Meghan admitting sheaposs not OK. She made the admission in a chat with Bradby about the pressures of her new role as a royal mum, appearing to hold back tears.Bradby, in an interview with The Times in which he discusses his own mental health, said he thought Meghan had an untold story which he decided to bring out. Do you enjoy reading about the royal family  for all the best royal news from the Mirror here He said: [I] was clearly influenced by my own experience and I didnapost think they were in great shape, and so I altered the way I was planning to do the documentary. I donapost regret doing that. There may be other times in the future in a whole range of subjects that I will alter my approachI sense something similar. He said he doesnapost think he can do his job without a reasonable degree of empathy but stressed that doesnapost mean you shouldnapost sometimes ask dficult questions.  And in that case [with Meghan], I felt like there was an untold story there. I decided to try to bring that side out, he said. In the one-to-one interview with ITVaposs Tom Bradby, Meghan was asked about the true pressures of le in the spotlight and the toll it has taken on them both.She said at the time:Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you’re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn – you know. And especially as a woman, it’s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it’s, well… Meghan then cuts to thank Tom for checking how she is doing.

Overjoyed Christine Forshaw worried she’d never become a mum after a -year struggle with the eating disorder. Doctors feared she had been left infertile. But years of help and support saw herto health and she became pregnant after a fourth round of IVF. Her daughters – lb oz Emily Tracey and lb oz Grace Christine – arrived three minutes apart nine days ago. Christine says: “After the struggles I’ve had with anorexia, my periods had completely stopped and I honestly thought I’d lost any chance of having a baby, let alone two. It’s double the joy. “I always wanted children. My friend said about trying IVF – I hadn’t thought about that. I got pregnant at the fourth attempt. My first attempt was in , I was . Now I’ve got my little miracles. “I know some will say I’m too old to become a mum but it’s about what I want and what’s right for me, not what they think. It’s not for them to say about what I should do in my le. I’m so happy.Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror “You can become a mum any time, any age. At  you have such a lot of le experience. I’ve always wanted to be a mum and I absolutely love it. “I’m really upbeat about it. This is what I always wanted, I thought I’d never have it. It is such a nice feeling when you get to say, ‘oh these are my daughters’. Being a new mum it’s a learning curve all the time. You learn every day. There’s so much to look forward to.” Divorcee Christine had IVF at a private clinic in London, using a sperm donor and paying £, in total for treatment. She adds: “Daddy is a sperm donor, I don’t know who he is. But I chose him from a website. It’s a bit like Amazon. “You look at the criteria for the donor, all his information. I know his hair colour, blood group and hobbies. His hair is dark brown, his eyes are green. You get a catalogue number, put it in a basket and pay.”  Christine, a customer services administrator from Epsom, Surrey, paid £ a year to keep the sperm frozen as she underwent IVF. She almost gave up hope after three failed attempts, explaining: “I phoned the clinic and said ‘I’m not going to do this any more’. “But they said we should have one more attempt. It’s heartbreaking when it doesn’t work and I didn’t knowI wanted to go through it all again. But I knew I’d always regret itI didn’t give it one more try. “They said they would put two eggs in this time, but there would only be a % chance of twins. When I came to do the pregnancy test I just thought ‘it won’t have worked’. The funny thing is I did a test at home and just stuffed it in my bag. “I got to Clapham Junction on the train before I pulled out the test. I just blurted out ‘Oh my God, I’m pregnant’. This lady next to me said, ‘that’s lovely’.” The clinic confirmed the pregnancy through a blood test. Christine goes on: “I went back again at seven weeks for another check. As the doctor examined me I said to him ‘oh, you’re going to tell me I’m having twins aren’t you ’ When he said ‘yes’ I fell off the bed.” Christine kept the pregnancy secret from everyone except her closest pal until she was  weeks. “I didn’t want to say anything as things could go wrong,” she says. “So I waited  weeks, then , then at  I just had to tell people. I couldn’t keep it hidden much longer. The only person I told was my best friend. She has been through so much with me, throughout my anorexia she was my rock.” Christine and the babies will be living with her parents, David, , and Val, , while she looks for her own place. She was at  weeks when the girls were delivered by C-section –  days early – at Epsom District Hospital. Doctors had discovered one of the babies was in the breech position. “I was awake throughout,” Christine says. “The joy of two perfect daughters is beyond words. They’re just beautul, after all I’ve been through I can say my le is now complete.”  Her happiness now is a huge contrast with years gone by. Problems with anorexia began when she was . A fellow actor in a theatre group made an off-hand comment, asking: “You’re the fattest in your family aren’t you ” Christine was ft in, size  and a healthy eight-and-a-half stone, but the comment haunted her for years as she thought she was fat. She recalls: “The remark was devastating for me. When I looked in the mirror I didn’t like what I saw. I was a normal girl, but I saw a chubby one.” Christine began compulsively dieting and making excuses to skip meals. She survived on apples, milk, Diet Coke and Trebor mints. For  years she didn’t have periods. Christine knew she was too thin but stilll tried to lose weight. She adds: “Mum and dad did all they could to help, they took me to the doctors, to counselling, but I stuck to my diet. “Kate Moss was my ideal figure, but I knew I was thinner than her. But all I did was eat a couple more mints. Then the next day I’d think my stomach was sticking out again.” After leaving college she worked in an office but continued to struggle. By  her weight was around four stone, her hair had thinned, she had hollow features and a skeletal frame. She wore trousers aged - and size zero tops. Her health improved after she met someone and tied the knot aged , with her weight rising to seven stone. Sadly, the marriage lasted just  months and more problems followed. Her weight plunged to under five stone and she was so weak when her parents took her to hospital that doctors discussed force feeding. “I think this was when I was at my lowest. I was killing myself.” she says. That’s when a family friend intervened and became her rock. Christine, eternally grateful, says: “She taught me the only person who could help me was me. “She helped me get my le back. I looked at old photos and realised how thin I looked. How ill I looked. “I’d say I struggled with anorexia from the age of  to .

Amy Sheddon, , and husband Harry , welcomed baby son Angus at their on April . Amy had planned a home delivery, at the coupleaposs house in Girvan, Scotland, and had a birthing pool set up in her living room.However, she was surprised when her waters suddenly broke with no contractions, reports the Daily Record. Despite having her own parents, Edie and Alistair Scobie - and her in-laws Stewart and Margo Sheddon - as well as son Harrison, two, all in the house, she had no choice but to give birth with everyone there.Amy said: We had always wanted a home delivery but this was not exactly what we were expecting. Our washing machine had broken just a few days before so we were in the middle of getting a new one delivered. Harry and I also had an appointment at a chiropractor that day so Harryaposs parents came over to collect Harrison to take him out for the day and my mum and dad had arrived. It was supposed to be a very normal day. She said: My waters broke as I was handing Harrison over to my in-laws and I was thinking, ok this baby is coming now so we immediately started filling up the birthing pool. As my in-laws were there to collect Harrison anyway, they just stayed and entertained him in the garden while I was in labour. Harry called Amyaposs midwe from Ayrshire Maternity Unit at Crosshouse Hospital, who headed to the family home to assist with the birth.  Just two hours passed before Angus made his arrival into the world, but not before plumbers had turned up with Amyaposs new washing machine delivery. Amy explained: I was in full labour when the washing machine delivery guys turned up. So while I was in the pool in the living room humming and mooing like a cow, these guys were next door in the kitchen plumbing in my washing machine with my dad. It was very surreal. I had imagined this lovely dark, atmospheric room and had set up fairy lights and music for me and Harry to bring our baby into the world and create the perfect birthing experience, but in reality the sun was beaming through the window, my whole family were wandering around and there were plumbers in the room next door. Itaposs quite funny but it didnapost make having Angus any less magical and we were so happy all our family shared such a special experience with us in our own home.  Amy and Harry had decided to opt for a home birth following a traumatic experience with baby loss last year. The couple were left devastated when, at their  week scan in March , doctors told them their unborn child had anencephaly - a rare condition linked to Spina Bida, where the baby develops without part of the skull. Amy and Harry had to make the heartbreaking decision to end the pregnancy after doctors told the couple the baby would not survive. The couple found out they had been expecting a baby girl who they named Starling Maree.

The big-hearted Britain’s Got Talent stars have each given five-figure sums to help the nine-year-old, after we ­revealed his parents must raise £, by Wednesday for a le-saving stem cell transplant. Manchester United and Marvel fan Nathaniel is not entitled to free NHS treatment because he is not a British national.He was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in the UK after flying here for a £, prosthetic eye fitted privately after losing it to a tumour in his home country Nigeria. Simon, , whose son Eric is seven, said: “This must be a really dficult time for Nathaniel and his parents, let’s all pray that this campaign gets Nathaniel the treatment he needs.” Comedian David, , dad to Alfred, aged eight, said: “Nathaniel is a very special little boy and we must do everything we can to ensure he gets all the treatment he needs so he can enjoy a long and happy le.”You can add to the donations to help save Nathaniel via this GoFundMe pageGenerous Sunday People readers helped raise £, earlier this year for three rounds of chemo at Great Ormond Street Hospital in March to get him in shape for the le-saving op. He responded better than consultants expected and is in remission and in a position for a transplant, using donor stem cells from an umbilical cord. Readers have helped raise another £, last week to fund transplant procedure and doctors at GOSH have kindly waived their private fees to ­reduce the cost. But there is still another £, to find. Consultants at GOSH say his cancer couldat any time and the window for a successful op while chemotherapy is keeping the cancer at bay means the cash must be raised by Wednesday.  After that, the chances of it working will be reduced, and Nathaniel’s only likely option will be palliative care. A host of stars have rallied around to support Nathaniel as the family race to raise cash. Former JLS singer Aston Merrygold, Paul O’Grady and Loose Women’s Coleen Nolan were among those backing the lad.Dad-of-two Aston, , shared the appeal with his k Instagram followers, urging them: “Please help Nathaniel’s family”.Reality star Katie Price shared a fundraising page with her . million Instagram followers and called for fans to “give Nathaniel the chance for a le”.Nathaniel said he is “so grateful” for the support from readers and celebs. He said: “Thank you all, everybody, for helping me and giving me a chance at le. God bless everybody.” His parents Ebi, , and Modupe, , have been moved to tears by the support from stars and People readers.  Ebi said: “I’ve been crying knowing that the British people have given my son another hope in le again when all hope was gone. It is like a modern day miracle. We are so grateful. “We all watch American Idol as a family and Nathaniel watches videos of Simon on TikTok. He is a big fan. To David we say, thank you so much for coming to the aid of a stranger and being a Good Samaritan. We have still got to raise three-quarters of what we need. I have not been able to sleep, I worry so much about how we are going to raise the money. It is so tough.” This week, Nathaniel had tests and saw a psychologist at GOSH ahead of the potential transplant and rested at his relatives’ home in Croydon, South London. Ebi said: “So far the test results have been wonderful. He’s in top shape, he’s doing so well. He’s been playing his video games. “He knows he’s going to be in hospital for a long time and expressed his fears in a meeting with a psychologist. We are doing our best to reassure him.” Nathaniel has already overcome a lot after having his left eye removed last September while fighting another cancer, myeloid sarcoma, in southern Nigeria. His family raised £, so he could travel with Ebi to London to have a prosthetic fitted at London’s Moorfield Eye Hospital in November. Within days of arriving Nathaniel suffered nosebleeds and a fever and was rushed to Croydon University Hospital where he was diagnosed with terminal AML, which affects around  children every year in the UK. It is so aggressive he could have died within weeks without chemo. His family were initially told the total cost of the treatment at GOSH would be up to £,.  Celebrities have voiced their concern for Nathaniel after learning of his desperate situation. Corrie legend Beverley Callard: “This little boy deserves all the help we can give him, so let’s dig deep and get him the treatment he needs to save his le”.Emmerdale’s Claire King: “Please, please help Nathaniel’s family raise £,. Stay strong, Nathaniel. We are all wishing you the very best.”Coleen Nolan, Loose Women list: “What Nathaniel is going through is every family’s worst nightmare. They are so close to the treatment he desperately needs, and the kindness of strangers can help him.”Benidorm’s Sherrie Hewson: “Every child deserves the best chance at le, and while there is hope for Nathaniel, we mustn’t give up. He has shown such bravery coming this far and now he needs a chance at the treatment that could save him. I hope everyone will get behind this courageous little boy and his family to donate and give him a future.”Samantha Giles, Hollyoaks actress: “If you can manage to donate just a pound, it could potentially save Nathaniel’s le. Thank you, thank you! You’ve done something wonderful.”Entrepreneur and presenter Saira Khan: “If we can all give a little bit, we can help to save this little boy’s le.” TV and stage star Claire Sweeney: “GOSH consultants have graciously waived their fee, but we still need to raise £, for a le-saving stem cell treatment. Please dig deep – we only have three days to save this beautul boy.” The transplant treatment is not available in his home country and he was too sick to travel. Ebi and Modupe were in despair when they first spoke to us three months ago. But Sunday People readers stepped in to raise £, for chemo which has given him a chance of surviving a transplant. Clinicians have lowered costs after Nathaniel responded better than expected to treatment and needed less chemo.  And last week we revealed consultants at GOSH have waived their private fees to help Nathaniel. The £, covers the donor stem cell transplant and the cost of care, excluding consultants fees, based on a typical inpatient admission of eight weeks and a three-month post-transplant follow-up as an outpatient. Professor Ajay Vora, a consultant paediatric haematologist at GOSH, said: “All the consultants involved in his care are working in a private ­capacity and have waived their fee because they want to help him. “Our time is not borrowed from the NHS because we are treating Nathaniel in our private service in our time.”  If enough is raised for the transplant, Nathaniel will undergo tests to begin the process on Friday, May . Doctors had hoped to have a bone marrow transplant from one of his two sisters Nadia, , and Nicole,  months. But they were not a match. Ebi said: “Even to get to this point where we may have access to treatment is a miracle.

He offered to meet Faldo, worth around £million, saying: “I’d bring him up to date about how long his marriage might last and how much he’ll have to payit doesn’t work out,” he said. Randy and Lindsay got in trouble in  when she was a boss at one of his businesses, The Tobacco Emporium. It was was one of  stores in Florida raided by the FBI. Both were charged with drug offences, including possession of marijuana and selling drugs paraphernalia. Lindsay pleaded no contest and got a  fine and six months probation.  Two years later, in a federal court, she struck a deal and entered a guilty plea to one charge of “use of interstate conveyance to ship drug paraphernalia”. She receieved six months of house detention. By the time of her sentencing, Lindsay had wed Col Nicholas De Marco, as a “career officer” in the US Air Force. Although they orced, she reverted to using his surname at golfing events.  The fourth man she married was Thomas Bracken, and she then wed multi-millionaire Scott Sangalli. Faldo, who flits across the Atlantic with Lindsay from a £million bungalow in Florida to a riverside flat overlooking Windsor Castle has been in the rough in his personal le several times. His marriage to first we Melanie Rockall ended after four-and-a-half years. He then married Gill Bennett, with whom he had three kids.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeAngry industry bosses last night demanded Boris Johnson review his “ridiculous” Covid travel traffic light system – and do it by the end of this month.They are furious the Government has put only  countries on its green list and insist many other destinations are safe enough to be included. And they say charging people to pay for costly Covid tests before they travel to andfrom green-listed countries should be axed. Fares to the few approved countries are already rising rapidly. But, as the tourism industry warned the Prime Minister is pricing most sun-starved Brits out of a holiday, health experts yesterday said no foreign trips will really be safe until the autumn.What do you think  Have your say in comments below. Chris Rowles of the Association of Independent Tour Operators branded the traffic light system “a damp squib”. He said: “This creates still more uncertainty – despite the UK’s stunning vaccination delivery. With  million people now vaccinated, we are still very largely confined to the UK. “And the fact travellers will still have to have tests when vaccinated is ridiculous. Fares are already rising dramatically. Once you add the test costs, travel really will be only for the rich and not the masses.” Under the traffic light system, countries are ranked green, amber or red, depending on how safe the Government deems them. Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar made it onto the green list, announced by Number  on Friday.But anyone travelling to them must take Covid tests before they fly from and back to the UK and another two days after they land. Some of the tests must be PCR tests, which cost an average of £ each, according to Which  That means a family of four could face a testing bill of at least £ on top of the cost of their holiday. Anyone who doesn’t follow the testing rules will face a £, fine. Traditional hotspots like Spain, France, Italy and Greece have been ranked amber – meaning travellers must take tests and isolate on theirto the UK. Turkey is on the red list, meaning anybody who goes there will have to take tests and quarantine in a hotel for  days at their own expense, when they get back to the UK.Paul Charles of the PC Agency travel consultancy said: “There are so many more safe countries out there which could have been added to the green category. “The Government needs to update the traffic lights before the end of May and remove the onerous testing requirements so those ing from a green country don’t have extra costs.” News that Portugal had made the green list sparked a scramble among airlines to schedule more flights to the country. BA is adding extra jets from London, Manchester, Newcastle and Edinburgh. Tui will increase flights from Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. But hours before the ban on international travel was lted, BA was charging £ for a flight from Heathrow to the Algarve on May . Two days earlier the same journey was priced at £. Meanwhile, a Ryanair flight from Stansted to Lisbon that cost £ on May  soared to £ on May .Online travel firm Thomas Cook said bookings for holidays in Portugal were  per cent up on a week earlier, while those for Gibraltar had doubled. A spokesman said: “People are so happy they can finally sht from dreaming about holidays to starting to plan and take them.” But health advisers yesterday crushed many travel dreams, by declaring no foreign holidays will be safe until all adults have been fully vaccinated. Research by Independent SAGE shows everyone over the age of  in England should have received their second jab by September. Until then, they say Brits should avoid overseas holidays – even in green list countries – in case they are infected with new iants. Professor Christina Pagel, of University College London, said: “We don’t know where the next dangerous iant is coming from. They will keep popping up and international travel is a massive risk until we have finished vaccinating.”Public Health England has now raised the threat level of one version of Indian Covid to “a iant of concern” after  clusters were found in Britain. Sage’s Dr Zubaida Haque called for consistency, saying: “We have quarantine for some people and not others. Everyone should be quarantined, regardless of which country they are coming from.” In another blow to holidaymakers, it is estimated more than half a billion pounds is still owed to those who had to cancel trips last year because of Covid.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Package deal customers are legally entitled to a full refund within  days. But many were offered credit vouchers instead towards future trips. Travel companies used the cash they had been paid to cover their overheads and pay down loans as lockdown hammered the tourism sector. Martyn James, of complaints handling site Resolver, said more than a half a billion pounds is still outstanding, with customers owed an average £ each.

He said they didnapost need convincing, it was merely a conversation.Mr Evans told Variety at the concert taping on Sunday night at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calornia. “They were so excited. They said, ‘We believe in the importance of vaccine equity.’For them, it was an easy decision to do the right thing because they were so passionate already. He said when he spoke to Meghan she suggested calling on he private sector to rally and for US businesses to step up, and so they got to work. “They’ve approached it with such sincerity and such leadership. I’ve been extremely impressed with their amazing commitment to the cause, Mr Evans said. Prince Harry received a rapturous response as he took to the stage of a vaccine fundraising concert in the US - but without his pregnant we Meghan. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had both been set to join famous names from the worlds of music, film and politics at the Vax Live event in Calornia. But while Harry made his first public appearance since the funeral of his grandfather Prince Philip to address the crowd, his partner did not join him in person.He was given a standing ovation by the crowd, before giving a speech praising the selfless efforts of front line workers during the pandemic. Speaking to an animated crowd of only fully-vaccinated guests, the duke asked for vaccines to be distributed to everyone everywhere, while also saluting frontline medical workers both at the concert and around the world.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have called on Covid vaccine manufacturers to act with responsibility and leadership and increase their allocation of doses distributed to poorer parts of the world. Harry and Meghan have written an open letter to the chief executives of pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca urging them to redouble their support for the UN-sponsored Covax programme. The couple have called on all firms to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights applied to Covid vaccines, and for a global public-private collaboration so production methods for the jabs can be shared. The Sussexesapos intervention into the global debate about the vaccine rollout comes on the second birthday of their son Archie, and separately they have asked those wanting to mark this to donate funds which will support Covax.  Harry and Meghan, writing in their roles as Vax Live campaign chairs, said: As of May , over % of the . billion vaccine doses administered globally have occurred in high and upper-middle-income countries while the very lowest income countries have administered just .%. As we are seeing in countries like India, the urgency to deliver doses now to save lives and stop the spread of Covid- is only increasing. Thataposs why it is imperative that we ensure equitable vaccine access globally so that people are protected, economies can recover, and this global pandemic can be brought to an end everywhere. Therefore we, the undersigned, stand with global citizens who want to see Covid- vaccine manufacturers act with extraordinary purpose, responsibility, and leadership in response to this equity crisis.  Harry and Meghanaposs letter is available for the public to sign on the website of the anti-poverty movement Global Citizen, and it calls on Moderna to move up your delivery schedule with Covax and increase the promised  volume to at least  million doses. It also urges Pfizer BioNTech to commit at least  million additional doses to Covax at a not-for-profit price and to deliver them as soon as possible this year. Covax was set up last year to try to establish fair access to the vaccines for poor and rich nations, but huge discrepancies have emerged. It has been reported that more than  million doses have been delivered through the system but more than £ billion is still needed to ensure most adults are immunised.  While the British Government is among the biggest donors to Covax, it has come under criticism for slashing the aid budget to . per cent of gross national income, despite the Conservative manesto pledging to keep it at . per cent. Marie Rumsby, UK country director for Global Citizen, said: The work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the Vax Live campaign demonstrates how urgent the need is to act now and ensure everyone, everywhere has access to Covid- vaccines.

Although its rare for humans to be killed by the venom the animal uses to paralyse and kill prey, the sting can cause shocking welts on exposed skin, leaving victims in excruciating pain for days afterwards.The post was replied to by Mndiaye_, who shares informative videos about nature, and warned others not to copy what they had seen, saying: This is why women live longer than men, s*** like this.That is not a jellyfish, itaposs a Portuguese Man Oapos War, also known as the bluebottle, also known as the floating terror.  Itaposs a species of siphonophore armed with millions of explosive stinging cells powerful enough to make Nemo an orphan and occasionally turn a person into past tense.

The Center for Orbital Reentry and Debris Studiesat Aerospace Corporation, a US federally funded space-focused research and development centre, updated its prediction for re-entry to four hours on either side of  GMT on Sunday. Earlier, the Pentagon had predicted a re-entry of  GMT on Saturday with a window of nine hours on either side. An area near New Zealandaposs North Island was identied as a possible crash location, but experts have said it is too dficult to say exactly where and when the free-falling remnants of the rocket will plunge back through the atmosphere. China has tried to downplay fears, with its Foreign Ministry insisting that most debris from the rocket will be burned up on re-entry and is highly unlikely to cause any harm. The US military said the uncontrolled re-entry was being tracked by US Space Command, and there were no plans to shoot down debris. EU SST said on its website that the statistical probability of a ground impact in populated areas is low, but noted that the uncontrolled nature of the object made any predictions uncertain. The Long March B - comprising one core stage and four boosters - lted off from Chinaaposs Hainan island on April  with the unmanned Tianhe module, which contains what will become living quarters on a permanent Chinese space station.  It is one of the largest space debris to re-enter Earth, at  tonnes. On Friday, the Aerospace Corporation announced that its Center for Orbital Reentry and Debris Studiessaid its latest informed prediction of the rocket bodyaposs re-entry location was given near the North Island of New Zealand. However, it noted that re-entry was possible anywhere along paths covering large swathes of the globe. In a blog post, the Aerospace Corporation said: The Long March B re-entry is unusual because during launch, the first stage of the rocket reached orbital velocity instead of falling downrange as is common practice. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The empty rocket body is now in an elliptical orbit around Earth where it is being dragged toward an uncontrolled re-entry. Hard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell previously told Reuters there is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area. In May , pieces from the first Long March B rained down on the Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings, though no injuries were reported. Debris from Chinese rocket launches is not uncommon within China.  In late April, authorities in the city of Shiyan, Hubei province, issued a notice to people in the surrounding county to prepare for evacuation as parts were expected to land in the area. The latest Long March rocket launched on April  was the second deployment of the B iant since its maiden flight in May last year. The empty core stage has been losing altitude since last week, but the speed of its orbital decay remains uncertain due to unpredictable atmospheric iables.

It is one of the largest space debris to re-enter Earth, at  tonnes. Space-Track, reporting data collected by US Space Command, has estimated the debris will land in the North Atlantic Ocean, but said on Twitter on Saturday that re-entry location estimates were largely uncertain until just a handful of prior. On Friday, the Aerospace Corporation announced that its Center for Orbital Reentry and Debris Studiessaid its latest informed prediction of the rocket bodyaposs re-entry location was given near the North Island of New Zealand. However, it noted that re-entry was possible anywhere along paths covering large swathes of the globe. In a blog post, the Aerospace Corporation said: The Long March B re-entry is unusual because during launch, the first stage of the rocket reached orbital velocity instead of falling downrange as is common practice.

Hard-based astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell previously told Reuters there is a chance that pieces of the rocket could come down over land, perhaps in a populated area. In May , pieces from the first Long March B rained down on the Ivory Coast, damaging several buildings, though no injuries were reported. Debris from Chinese rocket launches is not uncommon within China.

Halma Cisse, from Mali in West Africa, had struggled under the six stone weight of her unborn nonuplets and amniotic fluid prior to going into labour. But during her caesarean section, medics battled to save her after the -year-old suffered a haemorrhage of her uterine artery. An army of  nurses put the newborn babies into incubators while a radiologist fought to stem the blood flow. The premature children are still on ventilators and must remain in specialist care for another  weeks before they can breathe without support. Halma had been flown to Morocco for specialist medical care before giving birth just seven months into her pregnancy. Now doctors are working around the clock to care for the premature nonuplets.  They donapost have digestive tracts which can absorb food, Youssef Alaoui, medical director at the Ain Borja clinic, told The Times.A small infection in a premature baby can kill in a few hours. Halmaaposs husband Kader Arby said the babies are gts from God.The -year-old soldier told the Daily Mail he canapost wait to meet his children.I have been in constant touch with my we, but I had to stay at our home in Mali to look after our other little daughter, who is just two years and five months. Travel is of course dficult because of the pandemic, but we are arranging a trip for next week.  It will be a very joyful, and we will be thanking God the whole time. The happy couple married during a three-day celebration in December  in Timbuktu. The President of Mali himself Bah Ndaw is among those to have offered congratulations with a phone call. Askednames had been chosen for the five girls and four boys, Kader laughed and said: We will see!  Initially, doctors thought Halma was carrying seven babies which quickly caught the fascination of her home country. President Ndaw ordered she be sent to Morocco in March as she needed specialist care. The mum-to-be was in a hospital in Maliaposs capital, Bamako, before being transferred to Morocco on March , her husband explained. She then gave birth on Tuesday at the Ain Borja clinic in Casablanca five weeks into her stay.

I wouldn#t imagine there would be many clubs that have come out of the Championship and achieved that.“But we don#t believe the story is done yet and we#ll, hopefully, go to Hampden and get a positive result.”It#s not just the United boss who is up for the fight: his players are, too.Forget the carrot of European football, forget about the presence of Scotland boss Steve Clarke, all that should matter to the Terrors is cup glory.For Mellon, there is no need to motivate his troops, with the prize of kissing silver all the incentive they need.He continued: “Someone asked me after the last game: ‘Do you think you will be able to motivate the players for next weekend ’“I couldn’t believe that. I thought it was a bizarre question.mdash Dundee United FCMay , “It is probably the opposite – you are trying to make sure they hit the right levels and certainly they are under no illusions that going down to Glasgow they are going into a massive game.“You just have to get them focused on what the game is, play the game and make sure you do your jobs and only do that, don’t get affected by things you can’t control.“I am a football fanatic. I am delighted that I am involved in such a massive game.“That is what I enjoy doing and what I have been able to do all throughout my career. I am so pleased I will be able to do it up in Scotland.”Mellon, who spent the vast majority of his playing and coaching career down south, is relishing leading his team out at the national stadium.Admittedly, he#ll be looking for a performance more akin to the - quarter-final success up at Aberdeen than last weekend#s - league defeat to Ross County at Tannadice.For the Scot, however, all that goes in the bin with what is at stake and he says United are looking forward to #a really exciting afternoon# on hallowed turf.“There’s so much at stake and it’s a one-off so it’ll be massively dferent,# Mellon added.“It’s at the national stadium and the pitch will be like a big bowling green.“The pitch at Tannadice is very dficult, to be honest.“I’m not making excuses because it’s the same for both teams and you have to adjust and adapt.“The pitch at Hampden is fantastic at the minute so that’ll be good and, of course, it’s a semi-final with so much at stake against a Hibs team we know a lot about.“It makes for a really exciting afternoon.“Of course, there’ll be no crowd there which is unique but we look forward to taking on the challenges that come along with that and, hopefully, we’ll get a positive result.”Third-placed Hibs go into the showdown as the bookies# favourites, largely, due to their being six spots and  points ahead of United in the Premiership standings.It makes no odds to Mellon, though, who is only focused on ensuring his Tangerines perform in the club#s biggest game in many a year.“Underdogs are always decided by other people and I can’t effect that,# he said.“What I’ll tell you is we’ll go there and we’ll be expecting to try to be the best version of ourselves and perform.“We believe thatwe do that we’ll give ourselves a great chance of getting through to an unbelievable final.“We’ll go and attack that the best way we can.It was Hampden heartache in  but Calum Butcher is determined things will be dferent this time as Dundee United

Hampden for the first time in five years with Scottish Cup glory just two games away.Between them and the final will be familiar foes as Micky Mellon’s men face Hibernian at the national stadium.That#s because the Hibees were also the opponents in the last-four clash in .The Tangerines, though, were in a much dferent mood back then.Staring relegation in the face after a dreadful league campaign, United’s form in the cup brought blessed relief for fans and players alike.On the day Conrad Logan in the Hibs goal was the hero with the Tangerines unable to get past the big goalie, despite creating chances. | William Hill Scottish Cup\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed S-bzdCokYg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreenIt was tough for the United players to come so close to a Scottish Cup Final, losing on penalties after a - draw, particularly when relegation would arrive in their next league game.There is added disappointment for one United man that day, too.Simon Murray had arrived from League Two Arbroath the previous summer and had made  appearances for the club that season.Manager Mixu Paatelainen, however, changed tactic for the semi-final clash and there was no place for then--year-old Murray.Club captain that day John Rankin recalled the surprise of hearing the striker wouldn’t be stripped.He said: “The game came around pretty quickly and Mixu tried something dferent – I think he had Callum Morris at left-back.“The biggest surprise that day was Simon Murray not being on the bench. Those two things always stick out in my head as to why it didn’t go well.”Being a frustrated onlooker, Murray recalls that day: “I didn’t get in the squad that day.“Mixu didn’t pick me, unlucky for him!“That was the day Conrad Logan was immense in goal for Hibs. We were actually the better side that day, which was maybe surprising considering how our season had gone.“It was an exciting game and we had chances but couldn’t beat Logan in goal.“It was strange because we just couldn’t win in the league but in the cup it was like the pressure lted.“At that time the fans weren’t happy with the owners and, to be fair, it affected us players.“Confidence was shot around the whole club and it was a mess at that time.“But in the cup that didn’t matter, it was an escape for us.“We ended up falling short, losing on penalties, which was disappointing. To be so close to a major cup final is tough.”Things, of course, didn’t end well that season but fast forward five years and there has been a transformation at Tannadice.United bounced back up from the Championship and secured safety in the Premiership with games to spare.With new owners and a dferent set-up, much has changed since Murray left United for Hibs in .The striker scored  goals in  appearances in tangerine as well as  in  outings in the green of Hibernian.And Murray will be a keen spectator when two of his former sides go head to head for a place in the final, though he admits he’s finding it dficult to pick a winner.“It’s two big clubs going head to head in a cup tie, a one-off  minutes, anything could happen,” the Queen#s Park frontman added.“It’s a really hard game to call.“United’s form lately has been very good, even though they lost to Ross County last weekend.“Hibs# has been similar too and both set of players will be feeling confident over how their season has gone.“United just missed out on the top six and to have a great cup run, Micky Mellon has done really well.“He’s had a limited budget and only really brought in a couple of players. He’s done a great job.“They’ve had some cracking wins this season and it will be interesting to see what they do at Tannadice this summer.“Now, though, United have a massive chance to win the Scottish Cup.#All four of the teams left do, to be fair.“Who do I want to win  I’m not sure!” EXCLUSIVE: Dundee United Supporters# Foundation # how an idea in the pub became a bricks and mortar concern\"

co-leader of the council, he will also give up his role as convener of the city growth and resources convener.He told us: #I will meet with the rest of the Conservative group tomorrow morning.#I imagine at that time we will elect a new group leader and there will be a new council co-leader in the coming week or two.#It is only right to continue as a councillor for the next year, looking at the cost to the public of a by-election.#I don#t think it would be worth it for only a year left.#I do this full time so I have plenty of time to deal with queries that come my way.#I am going to work as hard as I have been working over the last four years at this new role and the existing councillor role.#The success in the list vote takes the party#s overall tally to five, after they held the Aberdeenshire West constituency seat too.Liam Kerr, who lost the Aberdeen South And North Kincardine contest earlier today, was ed as a list MSP for a second time, with Maurice Golden and Tess White completing the quartet.Scottish Labour too held their ground in the North East region, ing two new MSPs: Dundee-based pair Councillor Michael Marra and Mercedes Villalba.Lochee representative Mr Marra

ballot boxes under the protection of security staff.The counting process will begin again tomorrow morning at am at P#J Live.Aberdeenshire ing officer Jim Savege said every precaution had been taken to keep the votes secure.“We have made good progress with the constituency and the list for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, and that took us a bit longer than we thought it would,” he said.“We have also made good progress with Aberdeenshire East and we’ve carried out the first verication process.“We’ve decided at this stage to pause and continue with the count in the morning at am. The reason for that is the staff have been here since am.#It’s a very restrictive working environment for them with Covid-, wearing facemasks all day and with very little movement available for them.“For their wellbeing and welfare, we have made the decision to pause.“The ballot boxes will be kept in secure storage overnight, and they were in the exact same secure storage on Thursday night.

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses. The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"family echoes of the mcnabs of argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  # one of a family of three brothers and four sisters # and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s.

The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout.

My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite.

If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen. These are first jury summonses issued to women in this district.The th Argylls Defence Battalion, raised in connection with the present emergency, is encamped near Bridge of Allan.The customary assemblies which mark the close of Mr J B M#Ewen#s dancing classes will be held in the Town Hall on Friday May .A generous gentleman who has a business connection with the town and country has given the Governor of Campbeltown Poorhouse £ to be expended in tobacco for the smokers and tea and sugar for the others in the Institution.The contract for the daily motor mail service between Campbeltown and Tarbert — the existing one expires in July — has been secured by Mr A M M#Conachie, Low Dunashery, Tayinloan."},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup.

He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something.

The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"bearsden-choir-back-vivaldis-gloria-meet-choir","story":"How did you begin singing, and become involved in Bearsden Choir ldquoAt school we rehearsed a very ied repertoire to a very high standard, and I also learned to play piano and flute.

The result is a glorious, fascinating mess.MondayCapernaum, Film , .pmA -year-old boy survives by his wits in present-day Lebanon in director Nadine Labakis emotionally wrought drama, which was deservedly nominated for a Best Foreign Language Oscar. Zainlives in cramped conditions with his parents and siblings in Beirut. The family survives by smuggling drugs into prison. Its an ingenious scheme: the children soak clothes in Tramadol-saturated water, which are dried and taken into prison as gts for inmates. The illegal operation hits a snag and Zains parents decide to raise funds by selling his younger sister Samaras a child bride. The boy vows to make his parents pay and heads onto the streets in search of Samar.TuesdayMission: Impossible ndash Fallout, Film , pmImpossible Missions Force agent Ethan Huntreceives word that the terrorist network fronted by Solomon Laneis poised to take delivery of stolen plutonium. The sale is being brokered by an arms dealer called the White Widowand Hunt must infiltrate the exchange to prevent the payload falling into the hands of Lanes deranged disciples. His fellow IMF operatives join the mission, but the teams movements are closely monitored by the CIAs August Walker . Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the sixth and arguably best instalment of the globe-trotting franchise. While other blockbusters rely heavily on digital trickery, this film places its most expensive special effect, leading man Cruise, in almost every adrenaline-pumping shot.WednesdayAmerican Made, Film , pmWA pilot Barry Sealis haemorrhaging enthusiasm for his job as he provides for his we Lucyand children.

This illegal practice is rumbled by CIA handler Monty Schafer , who coerces Barry into working for the US government by flying reconnaissance missions over Central America to take photographs of the emerging communist threat. During one covert flight, Barry meets members of the high-powered Medellin cocaine cartel, who exploit his greed by employing him to transport narcotics back to America. Based on a true story of outlandish lies, American Made recreates the late s and s with a swagger.ThursdayValkyrie, Film, .pmThe Second World War is raging, but the tide is turning increasingly in favour of the Allies, and a number of senior German officers believe Adolf Hitler must be removed from power and the conflict brought to an end. Recruited into this secret group is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg , a young and well-respected war hero who has grown disillusioned with Hitler and the insidious reach of the SS. The charismatic soldier is pushed to the forefront of the plan to assassinate Hitler, but you dont need a historian to tell you that his mission doesnt go quite to plan. Cruise is solid in the lead, though a little more of his usual charm wouldnt have gone amiss. British thespians Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson easily convince as high-ranking German officers.FridayManchester By The Sea, BBC Two, .pmLee Chandlerworks as a janitor in a small apartment building in Chicago.

James Naismith, another professor-dictator, says: ldquoI think wersquoll re-impose mask wearing in the winter in crowded indoor spaces. It has the benefit of reducing flu.Why not throw in an autumn lockdown for good measure, Prof The very real threat that wersquoll never be free of masks, social distancing, and other restrictions demonstrates yet again the elasticity of Covid promises. ldquoJust until we flatten the curve is in danger of morphing into a coup that disables normal human le indefinitely.Multiple councils around the UK are recruiting Covid marshals until January , with the possibility of extending the contract until .The UK Governments SAGE advisers seem determined to keep restrictions going, as noted in their recent minutes: ldquoAs settings reopen, prevention measures will be important, eg... use of face coverings, physical distancing, adherence to quarantine, and encouraging vaccination.Westminster has just signed off a pound million contract for more of those fear-inflating, horror-genre Covid adverts that runs till March .If you think the state is going to all this effort for one virus, you need to wise up.Until , democratic governmentsrsquo pandemic plans were constrained by liberal principles based on the rights and freedoms of the inidual.The emphasis then was on isolating those already infected, or most at risk. This established public health formula was akin to the ldquofocused protection approach advocated by the medics and scientists who signed the Great Barrington Declaration, which challenges lockdowns.On the other hand, China, a full-on Communist, authoritarian, one-party state, imposed stringent lockdowns, rigorously monitoring compliance through systematic surveillance of every aspect of its citizens lives.This Chinese model inspired the High Priesthood of Modellers.

But this experience has distorted our perception of risk. We now must correct it.If a healthy -year-old woman has the misfortune to be infected with Covid, she has a .% chance of surviving thatrsquos less than the fatality risk for a general anaesthetic.A -year-old man with co-morbidities ndash other serious conditions ndash has a .% survival chance thatrsquos less than the risk of a person in that age group dying of any cause.A healthy -year-old woman has a .% chance of surviving thatrsquos less than the risk of being injured in a car accident.Even an -year-old man with co-morbidities has a .% chance of surviving thatrsquos better odds than living in a care home for a year.The overall infection fatality rate from Covid in Western countries is held to be .%, or lower. There is no evidence that any iant is more deadly. The average age of those killed by Covid in the UK is . years old, which is older than the average Scottish le expectancy.Covid deaths have slumped to single figures.

More frightened of public shaming than the virus, the horror of being demonised as a Covid-spreading bad citizen is what keeps them in line.Then there are those who continue to interpret the rules more strictly than any police officer. They wear masks as they drive their cars, despite the risk being non-existent. They mask up outside in the fresh air, even though the theory of outdoors transition has been more or less abandoned.

His success in photographing these notoriously shy creatures lies partly in his ability to blend silently into the seascape, becoming indistinguishable from a rock or clump of weed.Yet on a subliminal level, Howard appears to speak the animalsrsquo language. ldquoYou have to think like an otter to succeed in photographing or spending time with them, he says.The Highlands-based naturalist has just published The Secret Le of the Otter: a book filled with astonishingly intimate images of the creatures at rest, at play and at war. Getting close enough to capture them fighting, gambolling and even mating is incredibly rare.Of Howardrsquos three wildle photography books, this is the one hersquos proudest of because it was the hardest to produce. ldquoOtters are elusive in the extreme, he says. ldquoTheir incredible shyness combined with hyper-aware senses and natural camouflage has made them successful survivors.:Line of Duty proves appointment TV is not deadOtters have inhabited Scotlandrsquos lochs, shores and rivers for at least , years, yet their nocturnal habits and wary natures have made them shadowy presences, often accorded magical qualities in myths and legends. At one time, people debated whether they were fish, canines or amphibians: early clerics are said to have argued over whether or not their flesh could be eaten during Lent.And although they were hunted for sport and for their pelts until the practice was banned in , these enigmatic creatures seem always to have been regarded with affection. They were once trained to catch fish or turn fireside spits for their human masters, and there are records of them being tamed like puppies during the th century.Andy Howard treats them with respect rather than amiability and having spent a day on the hills watching him photograph mountain hares, Irsquom struck by his contrasting approach to the two mammals.With hares, he maintains a constant, low chatter as he looks them in the eye and clicks the shutter, sometimes addressing them fondly by name. ldquoWhen photographing hares, you want them to see you, hear you and be aware of you, he says now. ldquoWith otters, you donrsquot want them to know you are there at all.There are no pet names in his new book, in which he describes his relationship with the animals as one of ldquokinship. What does he mean by that  ldquoThe thing I like about spending time with otters is that I have to be as secretive as they are, in a way. I have to be furtive and become part of their environment to succeed with them. So I find myself quite often behaving like an otter.:Northern Ireland at : Growing up in a land of dreams and terrorHe prefers to work on stormy days, when ldquothe wind masks the sound of my shutter, and hersquos not afraid to immerse himself in brine in order to catch the ldquosuper-low, otterrsquos-eye perspective that brings the viewer right into the animalrsquos watery world.Rapt in concentration while photographing a mother and her cubs, he once lost his footing and tumbled backwards off the rocks and into the sea. ldquoI remember looking upwards to see green bubbles racing to the surface, only just managing to struggle ashore.His subjects ndash whose likenesses were obliterated by the salt water ndash seemed unperturbed by the dripping cameraman flailing around trying to retrieve his equipment. That day, Howard appears to have completed his transmogrication into a sea creature.An otter once got close enough to snf his boots another dosed happily in his presence after hersquod spent five or six days quietly observing it while camouflaged among seaweed. ldquoIt had grown to take me as a part of the landscape and would walk past quite nonchalantly within a couple of metres then roll about or curl up and sleep. I actually started talking to it ndash just whispering to see its reaction. It seemed to accept the fact that I was gently talking to it.When I catch up with Andy Howard, Covid- restrictions mean I canrsquot join him in his preferred, Hebridean snapping ground. So this morning, keen to observe an otter in the flesh, I preceded our phone interview with a mini-safari along Glasgowrsquos White Cart.:Celebrating Archie Brennan, innovator, pop artist, adventurer and former Mr ScotlandPrevious generations of Glaswegians would have been unlikely to see otters on rivers flanked by factories, mills and engineering works. Otters prefer clean waters and during the s, over-use of pesticides combined with industrial pollution and other factors drove them out of many British waterways. Some died as a result of toxins in their food chain and their numbers plummeted by %.Since the s, however, the ban on agricultural pesticides such as DDT, along with de-industrialisation and legal protections against culling, have led to a healthy resurgence and there have been several recent sightings along the now decontaminated White Cart.Unfortunately, however, my morning wildle-spotting expedition gleaned nothing but some ducks and an old fox scratching its fleas. Where did I go wrong  ldquoYou didnrsquot go wrong at all, Howard reassures me. ldquoItrsquos the luck of the draw. Otters have a great ability to blend in with their surroundings, whether it be the bank of a river in Glasgow, a peat hag in Shetland or some seaweed on the island of Mull.The fact they often float with just their eyes and nose above water makes them virtually invisible. ldquoWhen they are in the water, especially a river, they almost become liquid themselves, says Howard. ldquoAnd the way they move makes them very dficult to spot unless you have a really well-trained eye.Because they hunt mostly at night, their black, tarry droppingsalong with half-eaten fish, crabs or lobster, are often the only signs of their presence and ldquothe best opportunity to see them is when theyrsquove actually caught something and theyrsquore sitting on a rock or on the foot of a bridge, eating their dinner.Another trick, says the otter-whisperer, is to listen. Having determined that an environment is ldquoottery, hersquoll sometimes drive around with the windows open. ldquoI often hear otter cubs before I actually see them, he explains. ldquoTheyrsquore quite vocal.:Teddy Jamieson: Do we really need a Festival of Brexit Can he describe the noise they make  ldquoIrsquom not good at impressions, he laughs, ldquobut itrsquos a very high-pitched whistle thatrsquos designed to cut through the air. The natural sounds surrounding otters are quite low-frequency ndash waves crashing, trees rustling. A cubrsquos high-frequency whistle pierces through all the other sounds, giving the bitch otter a chance to catch up with it or find itthe family becomes separated. They are very good at communicating with each other.Late one evening, Howard was startled by a pitul screeching and followed the sound to discover a distressed mother otter whose cubs were being summarily killed in front of her by a male. Otters are territorial with males guarding a range of up to km. And while females often live together in family groups, dog-otters are solitary, communing with others only to mate.On this occasion, a marauding male had apparently taken over anotherrsquos territory and was ensuring the survival of his own genes. In his book, Howard explains that ldquobeyond her terrible trauma, the bitchrsquos body would respond by ing rapidly into heat, and the dog would be close at hand to impregnate her.Howard got no pictures that day ndash partly because the light was poor but also because of the emotional impact on him. ldquoIrsquod read about it happening but never thought Irsquod be in a position to witness it, he says now. ldquoAnd in a way I felt privileged to have seen such a raw, brutal element of the le of the otter. People that have studied otters for their le and work have never seen that happen.ldquoNature is quite cruel at times, he adds. ldquoItrsquos all part of the process ndash and yes, it was an upsetting thing to witness.Hadnrsquot he been tempted to intervene  ldquoI didnrsquot really know what was going on until it was too late, he says, though in any case, approaching a frenzied otter could be dangerous. For all their cute faces and ldquohumanlike qualities, these are wild animals with strong jaws and teeth designed to crunch through shell and bone. Howard once met the late TV naturalist Terry Nutkins, who in boyhood had lost two fingers to one of Gavin Maxwellrsquos otters while working as his assistant in the western Highlands.Maxwell did much to popularise the image of the otter as a cuddlesome, furry friend. In his bestselling  book, Ring of Bright Water, he described sharing his home, his bath and even his bed with the creatures. ldquoIrsquom not sure that sits comfortably with me, says Howard. ldquoMuch as I appreciate Gavin Maxwellrsquos writing, Irsquom not an advocate of people removing animals from the wild and keeping them as pets.In fact, the photographer takes the opposite approach, interfering as little as possible with the animalsrsquo natural habitat and presenting readers with a privileged insight into a world in which the human presence has ostensibly been obliterated.Most of the Secret Le images were captured around sea lochs and he often visits a location several times before taking any pictures. ldquoThat way you get to know the animalsrsquo inidual characteristics:they fish at low tide, high tide, where they like to sleep. It means I can be in position, waiting for the otter to come in.Howard conducts wildle photography tours and his top tip for clients is to be patient. ldquoThe more time you invest, the bigger the reward. With otters especially, the moment often comes towards the end of the time you allocate to spend with them. If I just bide my time, it should reward me in the long term and usually that does happen. Otter karma is something I teach my clients: donrsquot push itit doesnrsquot happen itrsquos not meant to be. If it is supposed to happen it will happen and therersquos always another day.And when the stars align, clients have sometimes been moved to tears. ldquoItrsquos such an emotional thing, to have a close encounter with an otter, says Howard. ldquoThatrsquos what drives me ndash itrsquos like a drug. Delving into the secret le of an otter is almost voyeuristic. So highly tuned are the animalrsquos senses that managing to get close enough to take nice pictures without it having any sense of being watched, gives you an adrenaline rush. Therersquos no doubt that my clients and I get high on it. Then you crave your next fix.The Secret Le of the Otter is not intended as a scientic text but a ldquocelebration of the species. Howardrsquos first book may well have been influential in bringing about a parliamentary ban on the mass culling of mountain hares and he hopes this one will have a similar legacy in terms of awareness-raising, so that people will ldquofall in love with the animals ndash thereby helping to ensure they are respected and protected.Of all the beautul images in his book, Howardrsquos favourite features a pair of white-tailed eagles, swooping down on an otter that had just landed its catch. ldquoTo get one eagle with an otter is fairly unusual to get two is pretty special.Inevitably for the photographer, as for the fish-hungry otter, there is always the one that got away. He dearly wanted to include an image of an otter eating a lobster and one evening, he watched through binoculars as one surfaced,  metres offshore, with a pair of distinctive red antennae hanging from its mouth.Howard made for the otterrsquos most likely landing ground and switched on his camera, only to find that the battery was dead. ldquoSo I had to sit and watch that otter eat that lobster ndash one of my dream images. It was lovely to watch but I could have almost cried.ldquoWhether it will happen again for me I donrsquot know. Crsquoest la vie, though. You canrsquot stress out or get angryyou miss a shot. You just have to hope itrsquoll come round again or something similar will come along.ldquoAnd inevitably, it does, he says, demonstrating his carefully honed otter karma.The Secret Le of the Otter by Andy Howard is published by Sandstone Press, pound.FAMOUS OTTER STORIESCuthbert and the OttersOtters are referred to as ldquowater dogs in Celtic folklore, and generally portrayed as helpful, friendly creatures, providing fish or firewood to people in need and even warming their feet, as in the story of St Cuthbert ndash patron saint of otters. A Celtic monk living at Lindisfarne during the seventh-century, Cuthbert was reputedly fond of taking nocturnal walks along the seashore. One night, a curious colleague secretly watched as he waded into the sea right up to his neck and began singing psalms. As dawn broke, he ed to shore, whereupon two otters came up and warmed his cold wet feet with their fur. Cuthbert blessed them, and they ed to their holts.Ring of Bright WaterGavin Maxwellrsquos celebrated  memoir describes his le in a remote cottage at ldquoCamusfearna , and the two imported otters he kept there as pets. He sourced his favourite ndash Mij ndash in Iraq and brought him to the UK during an eventful plane journey that saw the creature chewing its way out of its box and running rampage around the cabin. Maxwell fed the animal on bucketloads of collected eels, walked it through the streets in a custom-made harness and allowed it free rein of his London and Scottish homes where it frequently pierced visitorsrsquo ears with its teeth. The story was partially fictionalised in a  film adaptation and for a generation of children, the scene involving Mijrsquos brutal dispatch, at the end of a road-diggerrsquos shovel, was a tearjerker on a par with the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Tarka the OtterThis  novel by Henry Williamson recounts the le story of an otter cub that becomes separated from its mother and wanders the North Devon countryside alone, until it eventually fathers a family of cubs of its own, before being killed by the local otter hunt.

And how. The winning Tory candidate in Thursday nightrsquos by-election gained twice as many votes as the sitting Labour MP.To portray Hartlepool as belonging to Labourrsquos heartlands doesnrsquot really tell the story: this town is at the heart of the heartlands. It takes some amount of neglect and entitlement to lose it to the Tories by such a margin.If the swing from red to blue were to be repeated in the  UK election, another  Labour seats, once considered to be their natural terrain, would also fall to the Tories. The Labour Party, north and south of the border, can now be considered destitute: last orders have been called and they have no home to call their own.When I visited this town in  after it had voted - in favour of Brexit scores of Labour voters told me the same story: they had waited in vain for more than two decades for someone, anyone, to heed their cries for help.: What will SNP win mean for working class In  Hartlepool was listed in the top % of Englandrsquos most deprived areas in a survey that measured income, health, education and crime. They were resentful at being labelled racist by the elites in their own party for daring to back Brexit.If Labour strategists had cared enough to listen theyrsquod know why. After tens of thousands of jobs disappeared in fishing and car manufacturing, there was no industrial strategy to help this area recover. The same story was unfolding up and down the Humber Estuary: a wholesale surrender to Europe on fishing rights was followed by an influx of cheap foreign labour undercutting local wage agreements. These stemmed from EU pay regulations which encouraged exploitation of eastern European workers. To oppose this doesnrsquot make you racist.Jeremy Corbyn understood why, though, and this underpinned his long-held disdain for the EU corporate club. On Friday morning, as the full extent of Labourrsquos Hartlepool capitulation became apparent, several of Sir Keirrsquos company men were wheeled out to hang it on his predecessor.Anas SarwarldquoWhat chance did we have, they whined, citing Labourrsquos collapse in , but this was a lame excuse. In these local elections Boris Johnson has surfed the waves of euphoria flowing from the successful vaccination roll-out and the end of lockdown. In , working-class communities, swept up by Brexit and resentful of the Labourrsquos elitesrsquo EU obsession began to rebel. Hartlepool confirmed that Labourrsquos Red Wall is now rubble.In Scotland, the collapse of UK Labour is a watershed moment for the partyrsquos leader, Anas Sarwar. In England, the process of surrendering Labour fortresses to the Tories was begun by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. As they were mesmerised by neo-liberalism and corporatism they came to regard communities like Hartlepool and Bolsover as their politically-incorrect uncle Harry: we canrsquot disown them but do we really have to talk to them.Toryism of the most insidious stamp is now embedded in every corner of England and Labour have made gts of their former territories. The Labour elites who betrayed Corbyn no longer speak the same language as the working-class communities they once purported to represent. Itrsquos a language the Tories have now learned.: Theof Project FearEngland is now entirely under the control of an Etonian kleptocracy who have commandeered patriotism, royalty and gunboats to hoodwink working-class communities that they share their values. These poor people, owing to Labourrsquos neglect of them, will learn the harsh truth when the decade of austerity begins and they find themselves once more on the receiving end.Never has England seemed so distant in its culture, instincts and values. That a dissolute and feckless aristocrat, distrusted by his own party, and for whom poundk-a-year and free accommodation is not enough can triumph in Hartlepool tells its own story.Mr Sarwar now has a choice to make which will define his leadership. Does he continue to pledge allegiance to a polity now under the eternal dominion of this class  If he chooses to maintain his glib sufferance of such a state then he will make Labour an utter irrelevance in Scotland. If he chooses to lend his weight to a second independence referendum he brings his party back into the game with a chance of forming the first government of an independent Scotland.English Labourrsquos failure to heed the messages coming from their former strongholds mirrors the experience of the party in Scotland. They had a sense of entitlement that their fortresses in Glasgow, Dundee, Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire would always come through. As their grandees were seduced by the leather and lace of the Westminster bordello they simply abandoned these communities. Rather than stay and fight for them Jack McConnell, George Foulkes, George Robertson and Alistair Darling chose ermine robes and the Palace of Westminsterrsquos comforting teat.Mr Sarwar doesnrsquot need me to tell him that many of his partyrsquos former supporters voted for the SNP on Thursday against all the instincts and traditions of their families. Nicola Sturgeon has expertly deployed a hard Brexit and the gangsterism of Downing Street to keep them. Her promises of seeking a second referendum are now like confetti and last about as long. Scotlandrsquos First Minister merely has to represent something dferent from the corrupt regime that Mr Sarwarrsquos ill-judged Unionism reinforces she doesnrsquot actually have to make dferent happen.If Mr Sarwar maintains his unflinching support for a state destined to be controlled by the hard right for a generation then Labour is finished up here too. In this hersquoll betray those working-class communities who have been locked out of the Holyrood vanity project and its platinum-card lounges since the beginning of devolution.He talks about a Covid recovery parliament, but Hartlepool means that this concept is already out-dated.

Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

The English results may spell trouble for Scottish Labour and an opportunity for the SNP.The full results may hint at whether the last electionrsquos realignments in England look solid, with the newly interventionist, free-spending Tories winning over non-metropolitan, working-class voters, and Labour confined to London and the graduate middle-class in a couple of other big cities and a few liberal outposts.What look certain are convincing wins for both the Prime Minister and Nicola Sturgeon. That will be advanced by pro-independence voices as evidence of a gulf between Scottish and English aspirations.The weight of expectation means thatthe SNP narrowly fails to gain a majority, the immediate prospect of another referendum may diminish, but calls for one will certainly not. However, the SNP should not make such a vote Holyroodrsquos priority, even in the unlikely event that Westminster accepts it as a mandate and grants the power to introduce it.The consensus, even among most of those unwaveringly committed to a second referendum ndash indeed, the position professed by Ms Sturgeon herself ndash is that building recovery from an unprecedented economic, social and human crisis must take precedence over all .The Conservatives and the SNP may appear to dfer on almost everything, but while both enjoy solid mandates to govern, it is vital that they find a way to work together that builds up the chance of real improvements for ordinary voters. No matter their antipathy on the issue of the Union, other areas of policy that require effective action are broadly similar, and would benefit from productive co-operation.Rather than railing at Westminster, the Scottish Government should acknowledge that there have been shortcomings in a host of areas that have been entirely under its control, such as education, health, drugs policy, public procurement ndash notably over ferries ndash and that they need urgent action. That will involve responsible finances, and working with business to fashion a programme for growth and to safeguard jobs. Similarly, the Westminster government must treat their Scottish counterparts with the respect they deserve.Despite the prevailing view of him in Scotland, growth is what many English voters hope for from Mr Johnson, especially in Northern constituencies: investment in infrastructure, increased health spending, support for companies, a coherent trade policy for the post-Brexit period, serious reforms in housing, restoring trust and ldquoleveling up.Whether that faith is well founded remains to be seen, but the UK Treasury is spending at a staggering rate, especially for a Conservative administration. Here, of course, it will be the First Minister who decides how to direct those funds to bolster recovery. Constructive co-operation, not point-scoring, on both sides will be essential to bring that about.No one expects aspirations or conflicts over constitutional issues to melt away. Advocates and opponents of independence ought to make their respective cases. But even the most ardent adherents of either position should recognise that most voters ndash and the blunt realities of our circumstances ndash demand that practical measures to improve peoplersquos everyday security take priority over ideological stances, however dearly held.

One suspects that some people in the SNP will regard this as a disappointment.ldquoSo, Ms Sturgeon is going to be in a weaker position, vis-a-vis her party, and that will give her less room for manoeuvre in trying to play the timing of the referendum, or the referendum request long rather than short.ldquoSo, Ms Sturgeon, because shersquos in a weaker position, might now want to push for the referendum rather more strongly, but at the same time Boris Johnson may now feel somewhat more emboldened to try and put her off.Arriving at the Glasgow count, the First Minister was asked how confident she was of getting a majority.She said: ldquoLook, a majority has always been a very, very long shot.

Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"election-scottish-greens-see-boost-list-votes-claims-patrick-harvie","story":"Mr Harvie is standing in the Glasgow Kelvin constituency, though the Greens expect to make their gains in the regional list vote.Polls leading up to the election have repeatedly suggested the Greens will make gains.He told the PA news agency: ldquo seems to be up in most places, some places very strongly like yesterday in Glasgow Southside.ldquoThe tricky thing is the dference between getting our first seat on the board in places like the South of Scotland, Central Scotland, North East ndash it could be a very marginal dference, a very narrow gap.ldquoIt looks like therersquos three or four seats which are in contention for us but potentially close.

I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Ralph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer UTV presenter Lynda Bryans has said she left the Presbyterian Church after its “cruel” decision to deny anyone in a same-sex relationship full membership.In  the Presbyterian Church in Irelandadopted the new policy.The move meant the children of gay couples could not be baptised by the Church.It came after the Church cut ceremonial ties with the Church of Scotland due to its more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.The Presbyterian Church made it clear at the time the policy did not prevent people in a same-sex relationship from attending services.Speaking to Alf McCreary in this weekend’s Belfast , Ms Bryans, who co-hosted UTV’s evening news programme with her former husband Mike Nesbitt in the s and s, was askedshe was ever ashamed of her own Church or denomination.The -year-old replied: “I was a member of the Presbyterian Church until a few years ago. I couldn#t stay after the vote the PCI took about same-sex relationships, particularly the refusal to baptise children of gay couples.It’s so sad that they felt it necessary it was cruel, not reflective of Jesus’ love.”Ms Bryans, who is now a journalism lecturer at Belfast politan College, was also asked why so many people were turning their backs on organised religion.She felt too many Churches “made it about religion and ritual and not about a relationship with God”.The Presbyterian Church was asked for a response to Ms Bryans’ remarks but declined to comment.The policy stopping anyone in a same-sex relationship becoming a full member of the Church was contained in a report by its doctrine committee.In  the Presbyterian Church said its general assembly members were not discussing whether to prevent anyone from attending worship, coming into church, receiving communion, or having access to pastoral care, as the Church is open to all.“What was before the general assembly was the acceptance of a paper that posed a theological question of what represents a ‘credible profession of faith’ in our Church and the outworking of that in a person’s le — something that applies to all who want to be a member of our Church, regardless of background, orientation or anything ,” it said.“On many issues the Church provides guidance to our ministers and elders in Kirk Sessions and we wanted to consider what a credible profession of faith means for same-sex couples who want to become communicant members of the Church.The same principle also applies to everyone, regardless of background or circumstance and those who want to baptise their children.”Belfast Most ReadLynda Bryans: why I split from Presbyterian ChurchSketrick Island house offers stunning views of Co Down coastTotal funds at controversial Green Pastures Church rise to £mRevealed: Earning power of eight famous faces in Northern Ireland Arrest ‘Isis bride suspect’ Lisa Smithshe comes to Northern Ireland, says Reg EmpeyTop VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership raceLatest Northern IrelandUnionism in flux as UUP leader Aiken announces resignationPM invites devolved leaders to Union summit after local election resultsDonaldson pledges shake-up of DUP rules in leadership pitch to colleaguesFoster praises ‘straightforward and honourable’ AikenDonaldson sends documents to DUP colleagues outlining leadership pitchLatestWest Ham boss David Moyes looking to be a calmer presence on the touchlineSean Dyche: Burnley could have signed James Tarkowski for a snip seven years agoI just didn’t feel comfortable in England – Reece Oxford has no West Ham regretsPM calls Union summit as Sturgeon says second referendum is ‘will’ of ScotlandLiverpool keep top-four aspirations alive with battling victory over Southampton,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That is why we need meaningful, fit for purpose Online Harms legislation as soon as possible, and I continue to press the Government for such an outcome.”Chair of the Assembly’s All Party Group on Press Freedom and Media Sustainability, Matthew O’Toole said the incident raised a number of concerns.“It is very worrying that any journalist or media organisation would have their account locked for reporting a legitimate public interest story, especially one concerning organised crime,” the SDLP South Belfast MLA said.“I am glad that Twitter have apologised and reversed their decision. But it is a chilling reminder of the power of Big Tech in  and the willingness of powerful people to silence reporting they do not like.“In an age when social media s have failed to take action on anonymous smears and allowed misinformation to fly around the globe, it is unacceptable that they would bow to apparent pressure and silence media in this way.“Powerful people, whether politicians or crime bosses, should not get to decide what journalists report.”Editor-in-chief of the Belfastand the Sunday Le, Eoin Brannigan said the issue “has clear implications for the freedom of the press”.“This is matter of great concern to us, as was the outrageous advice that to unlock the account we had to remove the tweets in question, one of which referred to a factual story about a man who has been identied in the High Court in Dublin as a senior figure in organised crime on a global scale. Nothing in the article constitutes ‘private information’,” Mr Brannigan said.“Twitter instructed us to censor ourselveswe wanted to continue to use the accounts in question.“We put a series of questions to Twitter but received no answers. It’s very coincidental that the two tweets in question refer to Daniel Kinahan, yet Twitter won’t explain how enforcement action was taken in error. Given the volume of nasty abuse Twitter allows to circulate every hour, how come these two tweets were deemed worthy of the locking of accounts yet millions more go unchecked ”A Twitter spokesperson apologised and said the enforcement action was taken in error.“We took enforcement action on the accounts you referenced in error. This has been reversed, and access to the accounts has been reinstated,” they said.Belfast Most ReadLynda Bryans: why I split from Presbyterian ChurchSketrick Island house offers stunning views of Co Down coastTotal funds at controversial Green Pastures Church rise to £mRevealed: Earning power of eight famous faces in Northern Ireland Arrest ‘Isis bride suspect’ Lisa Smithshe comes to Northern Ireland, says Reg EmpeyTop VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayFirst Minister calls SF actions ‘above the law’ and says police abdicated responsibility before, during and since Storey funeral PlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership raceLatest Northern IrelandUnionism in flux as UUP leader Aiken announces resignationDonaldson pledges shake-up of DUP rules in leadership pitch to colleaguesFoster praises ‘straightforward and honourable’ AikenDonaldson sends documents to DUP colleagues outlining leadership pitchEx-submarine commander Aiken sunk by internal discontent at leadershipLatestAndrew Madden, Gareth CrossOpinionThe weekly political spin: Everything from the dangers of collapsing Stormont to the Berlin Wall and medical cannabis.Italy and Austria removed from hotel quarantine listAlun Wyn Jones confident in Lions options available to Warren GatlandUnionism in flux as UUP leader Aiken announces resignationLorna Slater: Scottish Greens will have more influence than ever,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We know we’ve had an increasingly positive uptake but, he said, it’s dficult to provide evidence of specic numbers in each area.” Askedstaff on high-risk hospital wards would be encouraged to take the vaccine, such as those who treat cancer patients, he said: “We’ll certainly use every opportunity we can through our leadership walks to encourage uptake of the vaccine, that’s something as a corporate management team that we have taken as a priority in recent weeks, to absolutely do that.” googletag.cmd.push Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen added: “We continue to have very stringent infection control measures at ward level, continue to have the use of PPE and social distancing as far as possible. “So those measures remain in force and are continually monitored and encouraged by ourselves. “The vaccine is another line of defence but we always will adhere to the very high levels of PPE and infection control at clinical patient contact level.” The prospect of another wave of infections was raised at the media briefing. Geraldine McKay, Director of Acute Hospitals, said there is some data which assures the Trust ‘no high surge’ is anticipated over the summer but a ‘small spike’ could take place at the end of Autumn and beginning of Winter.     She continued: “That would be normal winter pressures and respiratory disease so we’re not surethere would be any additional spike there due to Covid. “That’s the basic information we have at this time.” Dr Kilgallen encouraged the public to take the vaccine and adhere to restrictions to allow the Trust and wider NHS to treat other important health issues. “Take the vaccine when it’s offered but also be aware that restrictions that remain are in our best interests and we should do our best to comply at all times,” she said. ‘VOLUNTARY’ A debate has been ongoing in other parts of the UK about whether the vaccine should be mandatory for care home staff or those working in high-risk areas. The Derry News lodged Freedom of Information requests with the Western Trust, Health and Social Care Board and Department of Health- which oversees the running of the programme - to get a detailed breakdown of vaccine uptake amongst staff. In response, each organisation said it did not hold the information. The DoH explained that thevaccinationprogramme remains voluntary but where uptake is lower than average staff will be ‘encouraged’ to accept the vaccine. A spokesperson said: “As cohorts become eligible, iniduals make their own decisions about stepping forward forvaccination. “The Department does not routinely record reasons why people choose not to bevaccinated. “As the programme proceeds and more information becomes available on uptake rates within particular parts of the HSC workforce, action will be taken to try and encourage uptake in any areas where the uptake levels remains lower than average.” The DoH believes that overall, there has been a ‘good uptake’ of thevaccineamongst health and social care staff. More detailed data will be available in the coming weeks, a spokesperson said. She concluded: “This will enable the Department and Trusts to drill down and obtain more granular data regarding the ious parts of the health service andnecessary focus on those areas with lower uptake rates.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its time to get balls whizzing around coaching sessions, in house games on tap and a multitude of fixtures.Supporters will be absent. As will the use of dressing rooms. But thats okay. In time thatll . For now players need action. Thats the priority, though it would be a nice touchsome of the older fans, who have already been vaccinated, could get out to see a game.This column has also been pushing for the importance of young people getting out and active. The buzz from the endorphins flying around the body is one aspect, but the social interaction they have missed has been colossal.Underage coaches dont realise how much of an influence they have on the players under their watch. From interviewing players from ious teams for nostalgic features, they will often recall their early days playing sport.Just last week, former Ballinderry player Martina Devlin described Rita Moran, a coach at St Marys Magherafelt, as a fantastic person and mentor, a role model and the most influential person on her camogie career. It was more than just sport.As teams go back to training, it makes me think how clubs have a second chance to make a first impression on our youth. Just as a teacher can shape the career path of a student, a coach and sporting memories will determine how far a player will develop. You cant make a horse drink, but it still has to be brought to the water first.Seamus Downey still talks about Laveys one ball each philosophy at underage that helped hone a group of youngsters at a club languishing in the realms of B football into one of the top sides in Ulster. Their indoor facility was a help, but working on the basic skills all year round has worked wonders.The same can be said for Glen, who got their house in order before totally dominating underage football with a group that has their seniors jostling for a place at the top table. People will point to the size of their catchment area, but it wasnt until they organised themselves properly that things started to change.Underage coaching in clubs should be about bringing everyone up a level.Not only will it give everyone an enjoyable experience, which is the number one priority, But, in the long term, it will be a much healthier club.I always remember chatting to Crossmaglen player Cathal Short and looking on with envy at their success. What made them stand out  Yes, they had county players like himself, Oisin McConville, the McEntees and Francie Bellew. But, in club football, , on a given day, the county players from each team were to cancel each other out, Cross other players were of a higher standard. This made the dference.His uncle Aidan, a coach at the club and former teacher in St Patricks Maghera, spoke at an underage coaching camp I attended one weekend in St Marys Magherafelt. He revealed something that has always stuck out.Other clubs in Armagh judged themselves on being able to beat Crossmaglen at underage level. A victory over the Rangers constituted a successful year.In Cross, their benchmark was for the minor team to produce at least four players, every year, to push into the senior  the following season.They didnt concentrate on just the elite. Some years they would churn out more, but four was always the target. Underage medals were a welcome addition and driving the standards of coaching would iniably have them at the cutting edge of competitions.Their underage teams seeing All-Ireland titles being paraded into the hall helped with the motivation, but it still doesnt kick the ball over the bar for you.The biggest challenge in the GAA is giving everyone a chance to play on a regular basis. The Go Games format at the younger ages has been brilliant in terms of smaller sided games. Not only does it give more touches, but a  of  can be split into three teams of seven. There will be no subs and everyone has the chance to test their coaching in a game.The problem started at U level, with full dug-outs. A bigger club, of which there are a few, can add in a few extra Us to take the total to  and enter two U teams. Its not ideal,there is a case of playing across two codes – football and hurling or camogie.The case mentioned above is common, with three teams of seven becoming a team of , with  subs. This is where underage coaches need to ask themselves questions How can I finish the season with  players still coming to coaching sessions  We have all heard stories of the top three or four players not going as far as senior level. Emigration, injury, a loss of interest or their sheer size at underage no longer allowing them to dominate a game at minor level and above.In the long term, its bringing everyone up the ranks so that come senior level, there are enough numbers to field senior and reserve teams with regularity. Thats a healthy club.Bringing more players up through the underage grades is more important than success. Winning the odd trophy is great andyou are able to win U, U, U and minor titles while bringing everyone along, then thats the ultimate.Underage players will stick with youthey are getting games. In a squad of , like above, starting the same team every week is criminal. Ten minutes at the end of a game every week isnt development. It is tokenism.The greatest prize you can give anyoneis a starting jersey. Based on attendance at training, everyone should be given a chance to play a full game as often as possible. If someone is seen as a key player, use games to rotate them into dferent positions. Challenge them to use their weaker side, to develop a dummy. Give them the best possible chance to better themselves. By senior level, they will thank you for it.If you have big numbers at training, ide them up and play seven a side games. Two teams on, the other working on skills with another coach before swapping places. Introduce a competition every so often. Count the blocks, count the assists, count the dummies. Stick a photo of the winning player up on the club social media. Anything to keep things fresh.It is up to coaches at nursery level to give players the skill base. By U, they should be playing as many games as possible. And the more they get at training, the better placed they are to shine in a league game.When the final bell tolls for the season,a coaching group can still boast the same amount of players, they have delivered in spades for them.Thats the sort of impression a coach will leave on a child. After that, their development will take care of itself and a greater sense of self-esteem will see them blossom away from the pitch.What does  hold for the teams in your club  googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has announced arrangements to facilitate increased visiting in health and social care settings will come into force on Friday May .  The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.  As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Radius Housing is building  new homes in the Creggan area. The project will also bring major improvements to the facilities at Sean Dolan’s GAA club and the construction of a new multi-use community facility on the site. The project will transform the lands to the west of the current Sean Dolan GAC grounds at Bligh’s Lane and represents an investment in excess of poundmillion in the Creggan area. Planning permission was secured in January, and Radius has appointed P  K McKaigue as the contractor for the project, who will be on site in the coming weeks. googletag.cmd.push Radius is working with Sean Dolans GAC, Ulster GAA, Derry City and Strabane District Council, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the Department for Communities on the project. Alongside the signicant investment in  new social homes in an area of acute housing need, this project will support both Sean Dolan’s ambition to develop as a club and also the wider strategic plans of the GAA in growing the prominence of Gaelic games across the city. A range of other opportunities, activities and events, which will have a positive impact on the wider Creggan community, will also be facilitated as a result of the project. googletag.cmd.push Radius Housing is a leading housing developer, constructing more than  new social and affordable homes each year. Radius also manages more than , social homes, and provides care and support for many more across Northern Ireland. This project is the latest Radius development in Derry, with construction currently underway on the former site of Ebrington Primary School in the Waterside. Anita Conway, Director of Development at Radius Housing, said: “We are delighted that the construction of this major project is beginning, and we are excited by the ambition and benefits this will bring to the whole community. “We have been working with Sean Dolan’s GAC and the other partner organisations for over three years, and we see this as an innovative way to deliver high quality homes, in an area where social homes are needed, and support essential community development.     “As a developer we know the dficulties faced in acquiring suitable development land, and working with Sean Dolan’s we have both been able to develop an innovative partnership approach which addresses a wide range of needs in the local area. “Working with community based clubs like Sean Dolan’s allows Radius to help them realise their untapped potential, and bring much needed homes to the local area and maximise all available amenities within these areas for the benefit of the local communities. “This is so much more than a housing project and a sports hub. This will be a vital economic and social driver for the Creggan area and City wide.” Stephen McGeehan, Head of Operations for Ulster GAA, said: “Every GAA club is keen to develop the best facilities for their members, which allow their teams across all ages to develop their skills and increase fitness and wellbeing. “But there are always limitations on how this can be done, and we are delighted that Sean Dolan’s have been able to partner with Radius Housing on this amazing and far reaching project. “This will bring an incredible level of community benefit, not just to the club, but to the wider city area, and we hope it is a new partnership model which can be replicated in other GAA and sports clubs.” Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has welcomed commencement ofthework on the new much needed social homes in the city. “I’m delighted to see this work started. My priority is to deliver housing in areas where it is needed,and Derry City needs more housing. “This pound million investment is part of my new build programme, a programme I was able to secure poundmillion to be invested this year. “I commendthe work of Radius Housing and Sean Dolan’s GAC for working together on this ground breaking scheme. “This is co-operative working at its very best and I look forward to seeing the finished scheme in due course. “I look forward to seeing other developments in the near future as we continue to deliver the biggest shake up of our housing system in over  years. “Housing, and having a place to call home, is a fundamental right. I am committed to delivering a housing system that delivers rights to everyone across society.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council are coming together to set up and manage the Creative Encounters project. The aim of the project is to create a one-stop online directory for people and families planning a day out in either or both counties. The councils have now issued a tender seeking companies who could create such a directory. In a joint statement included in the tender documents, the two councils state that they had commissioned an audience survey across the north west in a bid to better understand the barriers to cultural engagement faced by our citizens. googletag.cmd.push “This research was used to inform a subsequent Audience Development Plan which identied older people and families as two key audience target segments. “Older people were identied as a segment that was the least engaged with cultureand the partner councils were keen to ensure that this imbalance was addressed. “Families were identied as a market opportunity, an audience segment upon which the sector could focus the rebuilding of audiences and participatory engagement as we emerge from the worst of the Covid crisis. “The NW Audience Survey research findings and the NW Audience Development Plan The plan incorporates a range of actions designed to encourage better engagement of the target segments.” googletag.cmd.push As part of the process, the councils have looked at websites such as familyexplorers, dayoutwiththekids and fantasticforfamilies. They now want to create a similar website focused on the Derry and Donegal regions. “In essence the project is designed to make it simpler for families to plan days out by providing all the practical information in one place,” the council statement concluded.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Local independent film company, Black North Productions, are currently preparing for their new short film, Grief, which is based around the loss of relatives and friends who have died due to Covid-. The film will tell the story of the loss of a granny and uncle and the fact that their close relatives never got to say goodbye or even attend their funerals. A local undertaker has agreed to provide a hearse and coffin and two local biker clubs, The Exiles MCC and The Centurions MCC, will escort the hearse into the city and will take part in the filming. googletag.cmd.push A local choir will also be signed up and for the shoot and they will perform several hymns to add to the serenity of the piece. Grief is a signicant undertaking and will be funded entirely by Black North. Although the pandemic has prevented many of their plans from proceeding, the film company are also putting the final touches to Stealth, a feature film that is set in both  and . The film will premiere online next week. Stealth will feature a host of local talent and as always, first time actors are given an opportunity to become involved in the world of film. googletag.cmd.push Mickey Quigley, Eddie O’Hagan, Jim Lecky and Louis Coyle feature in this short film.

Criticising the lack of facilities at Ballyarnett Country Park, Davy Cregan said as a disabled and wheel- chair-bound person enough is enough. “There are no toilets facilities and as result people have to take themselves and their children to Northside shopping centre for toilets. This is a human rights abuse,” claimed Mr Cregan. Emmet Doyle, Aontu councillor for the Ballyarnett district electoral area, said he had received a number of queries from residents and park users around access to bathrooms, general maintenance, surfacing and disabled access.  googletag.cmd.push He added: “I have spoken to the Director of Parks around all of these and we are currently looking at utilising the Earhart Cottage for bathroom access and I will keep monitoring how we improve this community asset for all users.” In response, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council pointed out there were no public conveniences in any of its parks. The spokesperson added: “Council and a number of local businesses across the council area have developed aCommunity Toilet Scheme which allows members of the public to use their toilet facilities for free during normal opening hours without having to make a purchase. googletag.cmd.push “The initiative ensures that clean, safe and easily accessible toilets are available to the public at no cost. “Participating businesses are paid an annual fee by council-based on the facilities they have available. The spokesperson added: “A full list of participating businesses is available on the Council website. “A large number of businesses who are not registered to the Community Toilet Scheme also permit members of the public to use their facilities,” concluded the local councils spokesperson.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The owners, the Trufelli family, put the site of the amusement arcade up for sale in October . However, the process has been hampered by the pandemic. In a statement today, the Trufelli family said that as thingsto a more favourable economic environment, it is their intention to re-market the business for sale. “Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” the statement said. googletag.cmd.push “As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity. “Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not re-open until the sale process has concluded.” The Barrys site has been placed on the market with a guide price of pound.m. The high-profile seafront site is situated in the heart of the town, between the newly renovated Portrush Train Station and The West Bay Beach. The sale is being handled by joint agents, Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company, on behalf of Barry’s Amusements and is being marketed as a development opportunity but equally would not disregard the potential purchase as a going concern. googletag.cmd.push A feasibility study undertaken by Savills has revealed that the site could be developed for several uses, including a -bed hotel,  residential dwellings or a combination of both, in addition to leisure and recreational facilities. Barry’s Amusements first opened at  Eglinton St. in  and has remained one of the most popular family attractions for visitors to the area.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net. In injury-time Bradley netted from the penalty spot after he was fouled. The gap increased to three early in the second half before Longford hit four points without reply.

Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well. Again McCormack got Longford level and then the home side went in front and on their way to victory.

That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great. These cheap, lightweight disposable barbecues, are not to be socially acceptable any longer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Rosaleen.jpg","title":"Rosaleen praises family on her 100th birthday  ","story":"BORN the day before Northern Ireland came into being  years ago, Rosaleen Rogan celebrated her centenary in style on Sunday.The long and happy le of the devoted parishioner was celebrated at Holy Family Church in Teconnaught with a special Mass dedicated to her by the parish priest, Father Brendan Smyth.The mother-of-five, grandmother to  and great-grandmother to  was greeted by her family and friends staggered throughout the day after the service and at home.Said by her family to ldquostill buzzing on Monday, Mrs Rogan was overwhelmed by the amount of cards, flowers and Mass bouquets given to her to mark her momentous day.As May  in  was recently decreed as the day Northern Ireland was constituted, Mrs Rogan, who lives with her daughter, Mrs Stella Rea in Magheralone, is one of the last surviving Irish-born citizens in Northern Ireland.Her th birthday was recognised by both states with a card from the Queen and a letter from Irish President Michael D Higgins along with a cheque for pound,.Mrs Rogan was also very touched to have been sent a Papal blessing, which was a gt from the parish organised by Fr Smyth, and a letter of congratulations from the Lord Lieutenant of Down, Mr David Lindsay.She was also delighted to receive a visit from family friend and former South Down MP, Baroness Margaret Ritchie who helped the family mark the birthday.Mrs Rogan, who hails from Annacloy, was also joined on Sunday by her two surviving brothers, Joe and Maurice McGrath, with their wives and her sister Marie at the Mass.She is the widow of the late Joe Rogan, a well-known shoemaker and repairer in Drumaness, and often helped him with stitching jobs in the business over the years.The couple shared a devotion to their faith and celebrated  years of marriage on September .

Her son, Joe, is well-known in Castlewellan for running his former business, JRrsquos shop and she joined him last month to celebrate his retirement.Before she was married, Mrs Rogan worked in service and looked after children at several homes in Belfast and Bangor, but when the Second World War broke out she ed home to help out on the family farm.Mrs Rogan met her husband through attending parish activities in the mid s. They married in September , , and started their long le together, living in Magheralone and the Four Roads in Drumaness.When asked how she accounts for her long le, Mrs Rogan replied: ldquoHard work, good company and a loving family. It was all down to the Lord, it was nothing that I did.One of the highlights of her le was when she was honoured in September , by being invited to Knock Shrineas a special guest of honour to meet the new Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Jude Thaddeus Okolo.Mrs Rogan was selected as someone who dedicated her le to prayer. She and her daughters, Mary Joe Walker, Imelda Savage and Stella Rea, marked the annual pilgrimage to Knock as one of the most important dates in the year. She was also presented with a certicate during Mass as the oldest grandparent there that day.Mrs Rogan is a famed seamstress and her family say that there is nothing she canrsquot turn her hand to, and shersquos still sought out to help them with the odd stitching job.Mrs Rea adds: ldquoIf therersquos a particularly dficult tear, the saying usually is you may ask Granny Rogan. She also took up knitting again during the lockdown and knits squares for prayer blankets.ldquoMummy used to go to thelocal bingo many many years ago with her friends and neighbours but still enjoys a game with family around the kitchen table.ldquoEvery Easter she joins the grandchildren and great grandchildren painting the eggs to get ready for rolling.Mrs Rogan loved working outdoors and was a keen gardener. Today she enjoys the lively company of her great-grandchildren and has also got comfortable with technology, video-calling other family members who are not at home and watching Mass at Holy Family Church online.Her family hope to have her attending Mass every Sunday as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Kevin.jpg","title":"St Kevin’s Camogie Club now a reality  ","story":"A NEW camogie club has been formed in East Down.St Kevinrsquos Camogie Club is the result of the coming together of Teconnaught GAC and Drumaness GAC, which both have strong camogie traditions.The two clubs share a sporting history mdash many years ago they united to form a football team also titled St Kevinrsquos.The exciting new venture materialised after a conversation between chairperson Maria Ryan, who hails all the way from Silvermines in Co Tipperary, but now lives in Teconnaught, and vice-chair Cathy Mason, a Drumaness native, about keeping the tradition of camogie alive.ldquoAfter endless conversations with Teconnaught chairman Barry Carville over the years, he brought it to the Teconnaught committeersquos attention, said Maria.ldquoOnce he did this, word got out about the interest of camogie around the community. This is what led to a conversation with Cathy, who had a shared love and passion for the sport, she continued.ldquoWe both agreed it would be amazingwe could bring young girls together to play camogie. The success of St. Kevinrsquos would not have been possible without the drive from both parishes.The newly formed committee is made up of a number of associated members from both clubs, who all share the same common goal of teaching camogie to as many girls as possible whilst ensuring a longevity to develop and establish the club.Cathy said it was ldquoan absolute honour to play a part in the creation of St Kevinrsquos.ldquoAs a Drumaness Gael I know that a very special lady, Annie Gelston, a Drumaness camogie legend, will be looking down with pride, said Mason.ldquoI would like to say a special word of thanks to the Drumaness and Teconnaught clubs for their unwavering support over the past few weeks, not only in the initial set-up but also with use of their pitches and facilities.The club held their first training session together at the Teconnaught club grounds on Saturday and it was evident that there is a potential successful future ahead based on the turnout of participants.ldquoTherersquos not many times in my le Irsquove been lost for words, but describing my emotions and feelings of Saturday is definitely one of them, said Maria.ldquoWe had over  girls show up for our first training session, over  in our senior ladies and U- session and over  in our sessions for the younger girls, she added.Cathy also reflected on the historic first training session, describing it as a ldquospecial moment as she watched the ldquomany smiles on the faces of the young children having fun and hopefully falling in love with the wonderful sport of camogie.Since many of the girls in all of the age groups had never attended a camogie training session before, the highly experienced coaches, who have backgrounds in both hurling and camogie, began teaching the basics to get them familiar with holding a hurley and making contact with the sliotar.Several dferent training drills were also incorporated to get the new recruits comfortable on the pitch.ldquoIt is very important to me and the coaches that we made this past Saturday and all future sessions a positive experience for the girls, said Maria.ldquoSo many of them took to it so naturally and we canrsquot wait to see how they progress over the season.St Kevinrsquos now eagerly look ahead to their first match against Ballela on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12581010.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...I remember this well because it was one of the first major in-depth news reports that I covered as a then relatively novice reporter.The investigation related to Paragraph  of those talks.The web version of this article will include the full wording of that paragraph, which said that the Irish and British governments “recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April ”It went on to say that such people would,convicted, benefit from early release under the Belfast Agreement and “would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued”• See below for full wording of paragraph This was not said to be a general amnesty but rather to relate to people who have been charged but not convicted of an offence, such as those who have jumped bail before or during trial. However, there was concern that the paragraph had been vaguely worded to placate Sinn Fein and would provide a future basis for an amnesty for all terror offences committed pre .It raised the notion that for the first time the UK was conceding that suspects would not necessarily have to answer terrorist charges against them. “We are in the realms of legal revolution,” Austen Morgan, an expert in constitutional law, told me. “We would normally leave these matters to the DPP.”Stephen Farry, then the Alliance Party’s justice spokesman, said: “Until now, it has always been the policy of the governments to regard terrorist activities as criminal offences, albeit politically-motivated ones. This proposal risks giving the impression that actions of republican and loyalist paramilitaries were legitimate.” Dr Farry expressed surprise that other political parties had been relatively quiet over the proposals, believing that the implications of the clause had been underestimated. “In every prosecution you are making a general point as well as particular point,You are saying these things are wrong.”In the end the paragraph never came to pass, due to delays in paramilitary decommissioning.Stormont would in fact fall over such disagreements the next year, and the amnesty proposal of  would also come to nothing.We now know that Tony Blair went on to instigate a secret scheme for On The Runs including Letters of Comfort and even Royal Pardons.You could say that the UK has been determined to end prosecutions for exactly  years.But in fact there has been an informal amnesty since . After all, how feasible was it that Martin McGuinness would be made deputy first minister — a position which, Sinn Fein love to point out, is in effect joint first minister — and then arrested and made to face a criminal trial followed by a jail term His funeral was attended by a host of dignitaries from President Bill Clinton to the first minister Arlene Foster to the chief prosecutor to the head of the PSNI and others.In  the ex RUC assistant chief constable Alan McQuillan wrote on these pages that future legacy crime investigators might face “political pressure, not least from the two governments, not to pursue those whose arrest might ‘destabilise the peace process’”.Yet while no IRA leader has ever faced charges commensurate with their decades of pre meditated murder and mayhem, several soldiers face homicide trials for single shootings.I see real problems with this reported UK plan on prosecutions. But I do not blame them for seeking radical solutions to the scandal of how legacy is panning out.• Paragraph  of the  Weston Park talks document: “Both Governments also recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April . Such people would,convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accept that it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued and will as soon as possible, and in any event before the end of the year, take such steps as are necessary in their jurisdictions to resolve this dficulty so that those concerned are no longer pursued.”• Ben Lowry is News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writingOther articles by Ben Lowry below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Ben Lowry May : Unionism can’t just be about managing long-term defeat• Ben Lowry May : Arlene Foster was given huge opportunity by DUP after her exit helped ruin UUP• Ben Lowry April : NI seems to rely increasingly on just one pollster for data on attitudes to a border poll• Ben Lowry April : DUP still has to choose between managing this disaster or total rejection of it• Ben Lowry April : His enduring marriage to the Queen was key to our understanding of Prince Philip• Ben Lowry April : Radio grilling of UUP leader exposed folly of unionists blaming Simon Byrne for funeral• Ben Lowry Mar : There should not be an Irish language act, but it is too late — the DUP has agreed one• Ben Lowry Mar : We have made it through the worst of the dark, dreaded winter lockdown• Ben Lowry Mar : MLAs lost control of abortion by rejecting modest law reform• Ben Lowry Mar : Whatever future Boris Johnson adopts for Northern Ireland seems set to lead to a crisis• Ben Lowry Mar : Scotland tunnel isn’t fantasy, but something kids of today might see• Ben Lowry Mar :  The cost of victims’ pension has ballooned without explanation as to why \u2029• Ben Lowry Feb : Unionists have fully turned against Irish Sea border because they’ve seen the scale of disaster• Ben Lowry Feb : We still lack answers as to why IRA funeral got special treatment at Roselawn• Ben Lowry Feb : Peter Robinson has long experience of what is and is not politically feasible• Ben Lowry Feb : There is barely any unionist support for violence, despite justied anger at sea border• Ben Lowry Jan : At last, clear reason for UK and unionists to stop being weak towards Ireland EU• Ben Lowry Jan : Lockdown sceptics have been undermined by crazy theories, but sensible criticisms haven’t gone away• Ben Lowry Jan : The Irish Sea border was imposed because UK knew unionists would take it• Ben Lowry in : Last night unionists celebrated a move towards Irish unity——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It’s about giving women earning opportunities.” Avon spokeswoman, Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon, is just one of the celebritieswho has helped combat the brand’s occasionally mumsy, bargain basement image, and fundraised for their female-focused causes – such as breast cancer and domestic violence.Avon looks set to be calling at many more UK homes, after the cosmetics company revealed in July that the number of people signing up to be sales representatives had more than doubled under lockdown.The company said it had seen a % “surge” in the number of new representatives joining its UK business since lockdown began.So despite the qauint image of the preened Avon lady of old, it looks like the company has new cachet, an ever growing number of willing women armed with their catalogues and lipsticks, ready to take on the world.Every woman knows that beauty is a weapon, le is a battle and the right lippie can make you feel set to make men fall at your feet en route to world domination.The Avon lady is like a feminist warrior, bonding with women over cosmetics, generating debate and empowering women to look, feel and live better.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedVeteran DUP man: I’m happy with loyalist protests – even illegal onesNorthern Ireland Centenary rose proves a thorn in the side for Sinn FeinSam McBride: From his s, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was seen as a future unionist leader – now might be his final chanceSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredMost PopularNI man dies after falling into riverBen Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writingSteven Aiken resigns as he tells Ulster Unionists: We need new leadershipIf Isis suspect so much as sets foot in Northern Ireland, arrest her, says senior unionistIRA tributes from US and Corbynite figures ‘romantic nonsense’                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommendedPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Nisha said the -year-old, who had worked in travel and tourism and lived in Bahrain, recently retired and moved back home to live in Bangalore in southern India.Sadly, he contracted coronavirus in March and was hospitalised. Dr Satyavir SinghalSpeaking from her home in south Belfast, Nisha said: “The care in the ICU wasn’t the care which one would have expected.- even in the private hospitals.”She said her sister had paid a “phenomenal amount of money” for his treatment, but added, “nothing could save him.”“It was a terrible situation. The poor girlhad to go through hell. “Even to get the death certicate and to get the paperwork sorted out has been a nightmare for her. “The funeral she had to do all by herself - there was nobody there.”Nisha Tandon is the founder and director of award-winning ethnic arts organisation, ArtsEkta and the creative force behind the Belfast Mela: an international showcase of music, dance, art, and food from more than  nations around the globe, held every summer in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens. She was also the driving force behind the development of the Indian Community Centre in Belfast and in  was awarded an OBE for services to the minority sector. Originally from New Delhi, she came to Northern Ireland in  as a young bride in an arranged marriage to Vijay, whose family first settled here in the s.Nisha said watching the television coverage of the pandemic sweep her native home is “just heartbreaking.”“Being so far away you cannot really do anything. The only support you can give is moral support by a phone call or by emails or video calls.“My entire family is in India. I am the only one who is here from my maternal side. From my father’s side I have cousins who are living in Birmingham.“It is very scary. We keep in touch with every single member of the family the older generation, we need to really worry about. There are so many cousins who are isolating and my aunties and uncles are isolating. “It is a dire situation and the aftermath is going to be even worse than it is now. There are going to be a lot of children who will be left with no parents and a lot of fathers will be left with no sons and a lot of sons will be left with no fathers. Especially in the very remote villages where it has reached and obviously in cities you can see what is happening they are showing it on every single news.“People are helpless - we saw it here and our hearts broke, while our systems here are much more robust. When you see the systems over thereyour heart breaks.”Nisha added there have been a lot of deaths in the Indian community in Northern Ireland due to Covid, but these have not been widely reported on. ArtsEkta has teamed up with the Isha Foundation to help raise funds for the devastating impact of Covid  in India. “It is a really, really bad situation in India and we have started to do a little bit of fundraising. “Whatever anyone can give, every little will help. It will go to the people who need support. Robin Swann has been really good sending three containers of oxygen from NI, but then remember India was also sending vaccinations to Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK.” To donate visit:️ https:www.totalgiving ... Isha-Europe-Corona-ReliefSusan Gillenlives in Jordanstown and tries to avoid watching television coverage of the pandemic in India.“It is so distressing, it’s like a horror film,” she said. Susan’s anguish is compounded by the fact her -year-old father, Dr John Mathai, is currently “trapped” in Kerala. “My father was a consultant geriatrician in Northern Ireland for many years and when he retired in  he went to live in London. “The whole year of isolation in London made him decide he would go to India for the winter. He left in November and he was due to come back on St Patrick’s Day, but because of his age he didn’t feel he would survive the quarantine when he ed to London, so he decided to stay on in India. “Obviously he wants to come back, but who knows when that is going to happen now with India on the red list for travel. We can’t get out to visit there, which is frustrating and upsetting. What can you do from so far away ”Susan FaceTimes her father quite often and said he is “quite calm and collected” about the situation.“He’s also quite circumspect about not travelling around or meeting too many people - he’s sensible. He’s not in a high state of fright or distress, but he’s very upset watching the other states, like the Punjab, which are in a really terrible way.”The Mathai family have many relatives in the state of Kerala, but Susan said thankfully none of them has died or become very unwell from Covid. “There are a lot of cases in Kerala at the moment, but they seem to have enough oxygen supplies and were better prepared than a lot of other states.”But, she believes the crisis across India has been “terribly mismanaged”.“Indian weddings, religious festivals involving huge gatherings and raucous election rallies involving crowds were all permitted to take place just before the second wave There doesn’t seem to have been measures put in place in the event of a second wave - the feeling was that they had survived the first one, so it didn’t seem to have been a big priority for the governments,”She added:“India was producing vaccines for the whole world and now it’s an embarrassing situation where they are having to rely on foreign aid to pull them out of this hole which they didn’t really have to be inthey had been prepared.”Dr Satyavir Singhal BEM, a consultant anaesthetist with the Belfast Trust, moved from Delhi to Northern Ireland  years ago. Now living in Newtownabbey, he has been watching the coverage of the horric devastation Covid- is causing in his homeland and, naturally, worries about his relatives there. “Sitting here you feel absolutely heartbroken and helpless. There is not a single member of the family who has been spared. Two who were caught in the pandemic, one from my we’s side, her brother’s we - they couldn’t get a hospital bed, but we could buy an oxygen concentrator for her and medication, so she survived and she is out of the woods now.”Dr Singhal said the oxygen concentrator he bought for his sister-in-law would normally cost about £-, but he paid £,, because of a shortage. “My sister’s husband is still in the hospital and my classmate lost both his parents a day apart.”Dr Singhal said he and colleagues in Northern Ireland are liaising with the medical fraternity in India. “They are still learning and hopefully we can guide them in terms of our experience of treatments or in terms of finding a hospital bed.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In an Assembly written question, Mr Newton asked the Sinn Fein finance ministerhe would “ give consideration to creating a display of these flowers within the Stormont Estate”.In response, Mr Murphy said there were “sensitive historic and political issues involved,” and advised Mr Newton to work with the other parties “to agree a proposal on this issue which is both in line with the Department policy and that is representative of our wider community”.Mr Murphy said he would then give the DUP MLA’s proposal “full and fair consideration”. In March this year, consensus was sought for a small stone centenary sculpture – at no cost to the public purse – to placed in the grounds of Stormont, however, despite broad support, the project was vetoed by Sinn Fein on the grounds that it reflected “only one political perspective”.READ: Sinn Fein only Executive party to veto NI Centenary commemoration stoneREAD: All you need to know about the NI Centenary roseA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
