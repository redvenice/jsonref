But there were repeated reports that officers felt \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 at having to drink to Andrew\u0027s health at the end of regimental dinners.Lt Gen Walker also said in his email: \u0027Buckingham Palace have informed me that in due course the colonelcy, along with the duke\u0027s other titles and affiliations, will be reallocated to another member of the Royal Family.\u0027He added that he would write to Andrew \u0027to thank him for his time as colonel\u0027.Formed in 1656 by Charles II, the Grenadier Guards have fought in almost every major campaign of the British Army, including the Napoleonic, Crimean, Boer, First and Second World Wars.York Racecourse yesterday confirmed it will rebrand one of its most historic events, the Duke of York Stakes, in a bid to distance itself from Andrew.The six-furlong sprint was first staged in 1895 and derives its name from Prince George, Duke of York, who became George V.The racecourse\u0027s head of marketing and sponsorship, James Brennan, said: \u0027It has never been directly about Prince Andrew. However, we are going to explore how we can make the name a lot clearer about its history – and that the name refers to an entirely different Duke of York.\u0027Andrew was a patron of the course, and a regular attendee at flagship fixtures, until he relinquished the role in 2019.The prince has now been forced to withdraw entirely from public life in the wake of his association with disgraced paedophile Epstein and his sex trafficker girlfriend, Maxwell.Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre claims she was lent out by the pair and forced to have sex with Andrew three times when she was 17. She is now suing him for rape and sexual assault in a civil court.The prince has always vehemently denied the claims. He was last week forced by the Queen to hand back all his royal privileges in order to fight the US case as a \u0027private citizen\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"CIA says Havana Syndrome not result sustained global campaign hostile power","story":"Share this article \u0027We are working overtime across the entire government to get to the bottom of what happened, who\u0027s responsible. And in the meantime to make sure that we\u0027re caring for anyone who\u0027s been affected and to protect all of our people to the best of our ability,\u0027 he added.   The European incidents now add to the list of roughly 200 reported cases of the yet unexplained illness, colloquially named for its first reported case in 2016 at the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba.Almost half of the cases involved CIA officers or their relatives, nearly 60 have been linked to Department of Defense workers or relatives, and about 50 involved State Department.In October, three Havana Syndrome sufferers came forward to share the agonizing symptoms of the disease, with two of them claiming it left them brain damaged and destroyed their promising diplomatic careers.Tina Onefur, Kate Husband, and Husband\u0027s partner Doug Ferguson were all working for the US State Department, stationed in Cuba\u0027s capital, when they found themselves afflicted with the mysterious malady.The syndrome first surfaced at the embassy in Havana in 2016 - months before Onefur, Husband, and Ferguson were diagnosed. The three described their debilitating symptoms - which include hearing loss, severe headaches, memory issues, dizziness, grogginess and even brain damage - in detail during an interview with NBC News last year. Onefur, sobbed as she spoke and recalling the fact she can now only work two hours a day from home due to doctor-diagnosed brain damage, and said she was washing dishes one night in March 2017 at her home in Havana when she suddenly found herself overcome with pain.\u0027The kids were upstairs playing, and I was standing at the kitchen window, and all of a sudden I felt like I was being struck with something.\u0027When asked what the sensation felt like, Onefur said the pain was like nothing she had ever felt before in her life, and explained, \u0027It was gripping - it was like I\u0027d been seized by some invisible hand, and I couldn\u0027t move.\u0027When asked by interviewer Andrea Mitchell how her health is today, Onefur, choking back tears revealed that her symptoms were still as strong and prevalent as ever, even after more than four years.\u0027It\u0027s not easy to talk about our health because it\u0027s an invisible injury,\u0027 Onefur said,\u0027It\u0027s four-and-a-half years of of excruciating headaches, it\u0027s four-and-a-half years of stumbling losing my balance, four-and-a-half years of vision degradation,\u0027 Onefur asserts of the illness, while breaking down in tears.In a nearby neighborhood in Havana in the winter months of 2016, Kate Husband and Doug Ferguson were working in the US embassy by day, with their nights spent together at their shared home.But nights for the couple - who both hail from Michigan - would often be strangely interrupted, by a high-pitched, piercing noise seemingly coming from their backyard.\u0027It was persistent, kind of at the same level all the time,\u0027 Husband said of the shrill sound, which they never managed to identify, adding it was \u0027very, very loud\u0027 and \u0027nothing you can sit with.\u0027Ferguson, however, managed to capture the mysterious noise on his phone and played it back for Mitchell during the interview.The sound on the recording - a high-frequency ringing that somewhat resembles a dog whistle - is strikingly similar to a sound previously released by AP in a 2017 covering the then just-surfaced syndrome.When asked if any other people in her neighborhood had heard the same sounds and was afflicted with similar symptoms, Husband said they had.After feeling a slew of symptoms in the coming months, the couple was later examined by neurologists at the University of Pennsylvania.In early 2017, Ferguson was cleared to go back to work, but Husband was diagnosed with brain damage by doctors, and was subsequently sent to receive treatment.Husband told Mitchell that during the diagnosis, a doctor told her, after analyzing scans of her brain, \u0027it\u0027s like you aged 20, 25 years all at once.\u0027She later retired from her work for the State Department on the grounds of a medical disability.Husband further revealed during the interview that she still suffers from balance issues associated with the brain damage she suffered after the 2017 diagnosis - a sensation that would trigger violent bouts of nausea, and a fogginess that makes even the most basic tasks difficult.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Schools defy end Plan B Teachers vow masks classrooms","story":"Share this articleBoris Johnson calls civil servants back to office to inspire private sector | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Katie Prices ex Kieran Hayler accuses party making false claims","story":"Share this articleKatie Price¿s ex-husband Kieran Hayler will be quizzed by cops over three rape allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"US press lashes Biden bumbling press conference mark year office","story":"Share this article \u0027Americans saw in their commander-in-chief someone willing to speak earnestly and frankly with the American people, and his command performance Wednesday harkened back to an earlier Biden from the campaign trail: forceful, direct, self-deprecating and earnest,\u0027 a Democratic campaign strategist wrote for the news network\u0027s digital site.Fox\u0027s op-ed said Biden \u0027demonstrated to the American people his firm grasp of both domestic and foreign policy issues.\u0027It made no mention of the president\u0027s \u0027minor incursion\u0027 comment. Biden cleared the remark up on Thursday morning after much confusion, telling press that his message to Vladimir Putin was \u0027any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion.\u0027 He added that such an invasion would be met with a \u0027severe and coordinated economic response.\u0027 Biden gave a command performance at his press conference | Fox NewsBiden\u0027s remarks on Russia should worry Ukraine | TheHillNo Course Correction for Joe Biden -

Of those sick with Covid, 1,905 were admitted to hospital.  All figures were from the latest data provided on Thursday, the update said. On Wednesday, 66,770 booster or third doses of Covid vaccine were administered, 29,893 second doses and 16,949 first doses.  Jean Castex said on Thursday the pass will come into effect on 24 January, provided it gets approved by the Constitutional Council. From 2 February, guidance recommending employees work from home three days a week would be dropped, with remote working arrangements now at the discretion of inidual workers and their bosses.  Nightclubs would reopen from 16 February.  Jean Castex said that the general Covid situation in the country was becoming more favourable. He added that the Covid pass could even be suspended, if the Covid situation improved dramatically.According to Reuters, Horowitz cited a need to relieve pressure on parents and schools as the reason for the change.  The prime minister, Naftali Bennett, in a joint televised address, said children would instead be required to take twice-weekly home tests for the virus. If they test positive or feel unwell, they should absent themselves from school until they recovered, he said. According to the latest update from the health ministry, patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at 19,659 on Thursday, up from 19,500 a day earlier.  There were 155 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 134 on Wednesday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,698 from a previous 1,688.  Italy has registered 142,590 deaths linked to Covid since its outbreak emerged in February 2020, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth highest in the world.  The country has reported 9.42 million cases to date. In the seven days to 16 January, there were 1,935.7 cases per 100,000 five- to nine-year-olds, up from 1,372.7 a week earlier. The rate among under-fives had also increased, from 706.9 to 829.7.  For both age groups, it was the highest weekly rate since the data was first collected in summer 2020, according to the latest surveillance report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).  The agency said figures for case rates may have been affected by a recent change in the rules for testing, which meant people with a positive lateral flow test no longer needed to get a confirmatory PCR test.  Although the figures seemed to coincide with the return of children to nurseries and primary schools in early January, there was no sign of a similar jump in rates among secondary school-age children. Rates were falling in all other age groups, including for people aged 80 and over, where the figure had dropped week-on-week from 641.7 cases per 100,000 to 432.1.  Every region of England had seen a fall in case rates. North-east England had the highest rate, at 1,410.0 per 100,000 people, while south-west England had the lowest, at 800.7.But, she added: “The continent has yet to turn the tables on this pandemic. So long as the virus continues to circulate, further pandemic waves are inevitable.” Moeti said Africa should “not only broaden vaccinations, but also gain increased and equitable access to critical Covid-19 therapeutics to save lives and effectively combat this pandemic”. The continent, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been relatively unscathed by the pandemic, reporting 234,913 deaths from 10.5 million cases, according to AFP tallies. The Stormont executive agreed that nightclubs will be permitted to open from noon on Wednesday, 26 January. They were closed on 26 December, the same date a general ban on dancing and indoor standing events was imposed.  Under the new regime, Covid certifications will still be needed to get into nightclubs and larger indoor unseated or partially seated events. For other settings the certification will no longer be required but its use encouraged.  The remaining Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland will be reviewed by the Stormont executive on 10 February, according to the PA Media news agency. Researchers said samples taken three to six months after the second dose of a vaccine have shown that the antibodies in recipients of two doses of Sputnik V were more resistant to Omicron than in those vaccinated with Pfizer. The study was funded by the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which markets Sputnik V abroad, and conducted by scientists from the Spallanzani Institute in Italy and Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, the developer of Sputnik V vaccine. It included 51 people vaccinated with Sputnik V and 17 with two shots of the Pfizer vaccine. It has not yet been peer reviewed. According to the latest update, 107,364 people tested positive for the virus, with daily infections falling since the beginning of January. Of those sick with Covid, 1,905 were admitted to hospital.  All figures were from the latest data provided on Thursday, the update said. On Wednesday, 66,770 booster or third doses of Covid vaccine were administered, 29,893 second doses and 16,949 first doses.  On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics published updated estimates for vaccine take-up among the whole adult population in England up to 31 December, broken down by ethnicity, levels of deprivation and other characteristics.  The so-called vaccine pass “is a new step in our strategy to encourage (vaccination) and ensure maximum protection. It is already producing its effects,” Gabriel Attal said, according to the Associated Press.  Under the law, entry into restaurants and bars, cinemas, theatres and other leisure and sport facilities, and passage on interregional trains and domestic flights, will be restricted to those who have had a full course of vaccinations. It applies to everyone 16 and over.  MPs approved the new law over the weekend and it is expected to be imposed in the coming days. France this week reported a record number of over 464,000 confirmed cases of infection in a single day. On average, over 320,000 cases per day have been recorded over the past week. The UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool said it had signed agreements with 27 manufacturers - spread across Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Jordan, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea and Vietnam - to supply the drug to 105 of the world’s poorer nations.  “This is a critical step toward ensuring global access to an urgently needed Covid-19 treatment and we are confident that … the anticipated treatments will be rapidly available in LMICs,” said MPP executive director Charles Gore, according to AFP.

Don’t ditch the mask People testing positive or who live with someone who has tested positive will have to isolate for 5 days instead of 7 previously, the Public Health Agency said. A small number of key workers will not have to quarantine at all if they have no symptoms, despite having been in contact with a sick person. “In order to deal with the high rate of infection, that is also expected to increase in the coming period, and in order not to put social functions at risk, we are adjusting the recommendations for testing and for restrictions,” health agency official Sara Byfors told a news conference. Johan Ahlander reports for Reuters from Stockholm that the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency said staff shortages could become a real problem and that key workers in areas such as power, heat, water and internet distribution as well as in the emergency services could be exempted from the quarantine rules. Sweden on Thursday reported a new daily record for Covid-19 cases, registering 39,938 cases, marginally higher than the previous day.  The health agency said a large proportion of the population risked getting the virus in coming weeks. The real number of cases was likely to be substantially higher as the national test capacity has hit its ceiling. The health agency asked people who can work from home not to get tested to allow those who need to be at their jobs to continue to work.PA Media are also reporting these are the plans for the easing of Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland which may get approved today: On Wednesday, Javid said: “We must learn to live with Covid, in the same way we have to live with flu. We’re looking to replace legal requirements on self-isolation with advice and guidance.” But with Omicron remaining highly infectious and deaths from the latest variant still rising, social care providers are being cautious and demanding clarification from the government.

We have come through Omicron better than we might have expected prior to Christmas.’ Photograph: iStockAnother 5,523 PCR-confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the State, while 5,048 more people have registered a positive antigen test through the HSE portal.These latest figures were reported by the Department of Health and the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Thursday evening.Nphet was due to meet on Thursday to discuss the easing of restrictions, as the Taoiseach said some measures could begin to lift next week. Signals from Government figures and officials have been upbeat in recent days over the current wave of the virus and the potential for a sooner-than-expected unwinding of some restrictions. Micheál Martin said the current restrictions had been due to stay in place until the end of the month but this could change. It is expected that Nphet will approve the removal of the 8pm closing time for the events and hospitality sector, which has been in place since before Christmas. Ministers will meet on Friday to assess the Nphet advice before the Taoiseach announces the decisions. Mr Martin said he will give a “clear and comprehensive statement” on Friday about the plans for the weeks and months ahead. “The situation is positive. We have come through Omicron better than we might have expected prior to Christmas,” Mr Martin told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “The combination of the booster campaign and vaccination and the fact that Omicron does not seem to be as virulent as Delta and previous waves has meant that the impact on people, in terms of severe illness and death and ICUs, has been much less. So, therefore, I think people can be positive, we can be positive.”Ireland is entering a new phase, he said, and changes are expected to happen next week. “The original restrictions were there till the end of the month, we may now go before that,” he added. “I do want to allow Nphet to meet today but yes, I think we can look forward to an earlier lifting of restrictions than we might have anticipated.” He said measures including the wearing of masks will continue for some time.Public holidayThe Government on Wednesday announced a raft of measures designed to thank the public and frontline workers for their efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic.Among the measures announced is a one-off public holiday on March 18th, as well as a tax-free payment of €1,000to frontline healthcare workers. Mr Martin said the details of the scheme are still being worked on and the date of the payment has yet to be confirmed. He said those in line to receive the bonus have “more or less” been decided, but that a panel will be established to assess the plans. “There is a panel to be established because it’s a complex enough area, in terms of categories of workers and so forth,” Mr Martin added. There were 896 patients in hospitals with Covid-19 as of 8am on Thursday, and 90 in intensive care, according to the latest Health Service Executive figures. This represents a drop of 15 patients in hospitals compared with the same time the day before. Professor of immunology Christine Loscher said there had been a clear decline in Covid-19 case numbers, as well as “positive indications” from health service staff about Omicron’s impact.“I think that’s enough reason to be able to row back on restrictions now, and take advantage of the fact that we’re in a good position,” she told Newstalk Breakfast. “We thought maybe a few weeks ago we could have up to 50,000 cases a day, we’re now at about 12,000 cases a day,” she said.The surge in cases had not been followed by a similar “translation into hospitalisations”, which meant there was no justification to delay easing restrictions, she said. A further two people who previously tested positive recently for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland have died, the North’s Department of Health said on Thursday.Another 3,879 confirmed cases of the virus were also recorded in the North in its latest 24-hour reporting period. On Thursday morning, there were 402 Covid-positive patients in the North’s hospitals, with 24 of them in intensive care. – Additional reporting PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid tracker app used by few to identify close contacts imj","story":"The Covid-19 contact tracing app was launched in July, 2020.

There were 503,421 cases over the period.Assuming each case had four contacts, this would indicate over 2,013,684 people needed to be contact traced, the article states.However, under 35,000 people were actually contact traced, according to data obtained from the app.Under 80,000 people check in daily to the app, less than 5 per cent of the 1.7 million “active users” reported to be using it. The HSE was unable to say how many people are using the app effectively for tracing purposes by having both Bluetooth and location settings correctly enabled.The app can be used to store a person’s digital Covid-19 cert, prompting the author of the editorial article to ask: “Is it now the case that this widely lauded contact tracing app has merely become a vaccine passport?”“Government press releases claiming this app is an ‘unmitigated success’ undermine public trust at a truly crucial time for our society,” the editorial states.“If we want the general public to meaningfully engage with digital public health tools moving forward, the HSE needs to illustrate exactly how this app is contributing to the fight against Covid-19 in this country.”The HSE had spent more €1.2 million on the app by last July, a year after it was set up.Meanwhile, Covid-19 infection may have “triggered or unmasked” late onset rheumatoid arthritis in a 63-year-old male patient, according to a study published in the same IMJ edition.However, the diagnosis in the patient, who was in the Mater hospital in Dublin two months post-infection, may have been “serendipitous” as “assigning causation is difficult”, treating doctors said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"current booster phase of vaccine programme to last until april","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin arriving for a Cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle om Wednesday. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins PhotosThe current booster phase of the vaccine programme will last until April, with mass vaccination centres to be retained up until then for people who were recently infected with Covid.A high-powered meeting was told on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of people will need to be given their boosters in the coming months, as they contracted Covid before being boosted.They will become eligible at different stages up to April, depending on when they caught the disease. There are at least 500,000 people who received either positive PCR or antigen tests recently and they will be ineligible for a booster shot for three months after diagnosis.The figures were given by Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid at a meeting of the Covid Oversight Group (COG), which is also attended by members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).Sources at the meeting said chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan indicated the Covid-19 situation was improving, but the numbers remained high. However, on the eve of a key meeting of Nphet, Coalition figures believe the direction of travel on unwinding restrictions is now near-irreversible.“The writing’s on the wall for the last week: with all the indicators, you cannot restrict the public to the extent we are from normal activities without justification,” one source said. Nonetheless, the Government expects there will be a rebound in case numbers once restrictions are relaxed in the days and weeks to come – a similar trend was observed in Denmark recently.‘Well beyond’ peakTaoiseach Micheál Martin told his parliamentary party the country is “well beyond” the peak of the Omicron wave of the pandemic and is in a good position to begin a phased lifting of\u0026nbsprestrictions.He said the booster programme was delivered in an “impactful and efficient way” and Covid-19 case numbers are “reducing significantly”. Mr Martin said “the situation is much better than feared” but that the unboosted and unvaccinated should be encouraged to avail of the jabs.The focus is now likely to switch to targeting those who have yet to come forward.Some health sources believe the retention of the Covid pass for indoor dining, which the Government has indicated will be phased out, would help uptake rates – especially among younger people, where it is lagging. That idea enjoys some support, with one Cabinet source saying on Wednesday they would favour the retention of the cert if it were proposed.Elsewhere, Coalition figures are also eyeing upcoming tapering of Covid schemes in the coming months, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, and eligibility terms for the pandemic unemployment payment. “If it’s all systems go in respect of sectors being open and trading uninhibited, I suspect everyone knows what that means for supports,” one Minister said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers and school managers need to strike sensible balance on covid says varadkar","story":"Independent TD Carol Nolan  said thousands of very young children are ‘numb with the cold’ during the school day due to windows being kept open.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said it is “passing the point of reasonable balance” if a child is required to wear gloves and coats in their classroom because of all of the windows being open.He said there is “a sensible balance” between air filtration, clean air and “comfortable, tolerable temperatures” in school classrooms. Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday, Mr Varadkar said the country is moving into a different phase and chapter of managing the Covid-19 pandemic and that the risk in schools is “lower than it was a few months ago”.The Tánaiste was responding to Independent TD Carol Nolan during Leaders’ Questions, who said thousands of very young children are “numb with the cold” during the school day due to windows being kept open.The Laois-Offaly TD said parents had contacted her to say their children “are returning home from school with headaches or mostly pain from the constant clenching of their teeth and from the shivering”.In response, Mr Varadkar said no child should be in a classroom, wearing an anorak or having to wear gloves “because it’s so cold”.“I know some children do have to experience that often because of prefabs and inadequate buildings even though we’ve replaced so many prefabs in recent years. “But you can take things to an extreme and if a classroom is so cold because all the windows are open, that a child has to wear gloves and has to wear a coat, that is probably passing the point of reasonable balance,” he said.“I know it is difficult for teachers and school managers to make that judgment but we are asking them to make that judgment, to be sensible in finding and getting that balance right.” He said he knew the importance of “airing a room” but that didn’t necessarily mean “that you have to keep the windows open for eight hours”.Mr Varadkar said the risk in schools is lower now in part because the Omicron variant has been less severe, primary school children being vaccinated and also the level of immunity that’s built up in society.He said this will in turn allow the Government to update guidelines in relation to schools and workplaces, which they intend to do.Mr Varadkar also said there is a meeting in relation to the Leaving Certificate on Thursday and clarity would be provided to students “in the very near future”.Ms Nolan asked how could it be expected for students and teachers to learn and work in classrooms and school buildings that are “absolutely freezing cold”.

But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsFake chicken is the future – and it’s absolutely deliciousTongan \u0026#39Aquaman\u0026#39 survives tsunami and 27 hours at seaSo sweet!

It read: “We’re sorry if we seem intrusive, but we just want to make clear that we would be unwilling for two men in a partnership to view or buy our house.“As it is contrary to the gracious teaching in God’s Word, the Holy Bible, e.g Romans 1:24-28 and Jude 7 (King James Version). With regards.”Mr Mantell told MailOnline: “Initially for the first 10 seconds I laughed. I thought it was a joke.“But then I was upset and angry and I had a cry on the phone to my mum. Homophobia still exists, it is still out there. I did not see it coming. I was blindsided by it.”He reported their texts to the online estate agents, Purplebricks, who were selling it via Rightmove, which has now decided to cease selling the property saying the comments from the owners are against its “views and values”.A Purplebricks spokesperson said: “Purplebricks celebrates ersity and the message that Lachlan and Luke received is completely opposed to our views and values. We immediately contacted the seller to return their fee and request that they sell their property with a different agent.”This is not the first time that Ms Brunker and Mr Main have expressed their views on gay relationships - both of them wrote to a House of Lords Committee in 2019 outlining their views on how the subject should be handled in schools’ “relationship education”.Mr Main is listed as a director of LM Buildscapes Ltd, a company which was dissolved in 2011, but his Transit van still carries the name of LM Buildscapes.Dr Bunker, who obtained her PhD at University College London, appeared on a 2017 YouTube video as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute at the University of Cambridge.She is currently listed as staff on the website of Cambridge University’s Synthetic Biology Interdisciplinary Research Centre.Contacted by MailOnline, Mr Main said he would have to discuss the matter with his wife, but added: “Not that we’re ashamed of what we said in any way.”Dr Brunker did not respond to a request for comment via the University of Cambridge made by this newspaper. The  also attempted to contact Mr Main.The incident has echoes of the 2014 “gay cake row” in Belfast when a bakery refused to supply a cake decorated with the words “support gay marriage”.Ashers Bakers won their case in the Supreme Court in 2018 on the grounds that no-one could be forced to promote a belief they profoundly disagreed with.Earlier this month, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) threw out the case made against the Christian couple who refused to bake a cake with a message in support of gay marriage in what Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said was a “victory for freedom of expression and belief”.More from NewsTongan \u0026#39Aquaman\u0026#39 survives tsunami and 27 hours at seaSo sweet!

Welcoming this new addition to his ranks, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, gleefully introduced Wakeford as the “honourable member for Bury South”. I beg to differ. Wakeford’s actions are deeply dishonourable and an insult to Red Wall voters in his constituency, many of whom voted Conservative for the first time in 2019 only after wrestling with their conscience.Tribal politics was on full display in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Wakeford wore a Union Jack mask as he crossed (or should that be scuttled over?) the floor to sit on the Labour benches. Previously, he had been happy to use all sorts of abusive terms about Labour MPs. Suddenly, they were his friends. On the Conservative benches, there was much finger-pointing and booing. Insults were hurled, the least of which was “disgrace!” Boris Johnson’s performance was far more robust than his miserable TV interview the day before. A betrayal of the party is the very worst thing that can happen in first-past-the-post politics, and his MPs rallied around him. Confidently, he predicted that Bury South will be won again by the Conservatives under his leadership at the next general election – two claims which look doubtful at this point. Yet as the session wore on, I waited and waited for what I had hoped would be the killer line from the Prime Minister. He never uttered it.  I was anticipating that Johnson might have the wit to demand that Wakeford behave with some degree of honour and submit himself to a by-election. It would be particularly appropriate for this backbencher, of all MPs, to do so. In September 2020, he co-sponsored and voted for a private members’ bill that would “enable the recall of Members of the House of Commons who voluntarily change their political party affiliation and for connected purposes”. It is a near-certainty that in his case, this will never happen. The sheer hypocrisy of this man knows no bounds.My own 25-year battle against the British establishment evolved from merely wanting to leave the European Union to wanting to change politics for good. I believe our entire political system is in need of radical reform. Millions of people hoped that Brexit would herald the start of a new era in politics. Sadly, the Wakeford affair shows that old habits die hard. Political parties and MPs appear to worry more about themselves and their careers than the vital issue of public trust. Over the last 30 years, there have been 23 defections in Westminster. Of these, only two MPs have triggered by-elections immediately. I am pleased to say that I was involved in both of them. In 2013 and 2014, I and the late Stuart Wheeler, who was then UKIP’s treasurer, discussed with a number of sitting MPs the possibility of them crossing over to become UKIP MPs. Every one of them – and there were several – would have been a huge asset to our campaign, yet I was insistent that the only proper course of action would be to hold a by-election to legitimise the switch. Honourably, Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless agreed, and both won their subsequent by elections. I had hoped that we had set a new standard in politics and in public life. Clearly, I was wrong. Wakeford\u0027s behaviour and sense of entitlement is despicable. He seems to think that every Conservative voter in Bury South voted for him personally. In truth, very few MPs have much of a personal vote. General elections now tend to be decided by people voting for or against the main party leaders. I hope sincerely that the Labour Party in Bury South de-selects Wakeford. We don\u0027t need people like him in politics today. The Conservative Party must seize this opportunity – not just to prevent further defections, but to show the country that Brexit is just the beginning of re-establishing trust between the governors and the governed. Legislation should be put forward requiring any MP who defects to hold a by-election. After the student drinking culture in Number 10 that has been exposed recently, such a move might just be a way for the Conservative Party to save itself. I won’t, however, hold my breath. More from NewsFake chicken is the future – and it’s absolutely deliciousTongan \u0026#39Aquaman\u0026#39 survives tsunami and 27 hours at seaSo sweet!

The London Mayor is certainly acting like he does not want the capital to recover from Covid.Khan announced this week that masks will remain a condition of travel on Transport for London even as the government’s ‘Plan B’ mask mandate came to an end. This is virtue signalling that will keep Covid present in our lives while doing little for public health.Khan asserts that mask-wearing is the ‘single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid-19’. This is a pious declaration without evidence. It is preposterous to suggest that masks are more important or effective than getting vaccinated or staying at home when you are unwell. The arbitrariness of the mandate demonstrates that this is little more than political posturing.Face coverings have become a bizarrely partisan issue.  At first, we were told not to wear masks — a ‘noble lie’ to prevent health professionals from running short. Then we were instructed that they are essential to save lives. These mixed messages left many people questioning the government’s scientific advice throughout the pandemic.Surgical masks likely marginally reduce the spread of the virus — the Bangladesh randomised control trial suggested by a modest 9 per cent. Those who are particularly vulnerable may well be advised to continue to wear a mask of surgical or N95-standard. But we should not exaggerate their importance. The effect of wearing masks just on public transport — either on your way to an open plan office or to socialise with friends — is likely to be practically zero.More broadly, mask mandates make little sense as the virus turns endemic. We just saw how more draconian restrictions in response to omicron in the likes of France and Germany did not achieve markedly different outcomes to England.The good news is that the ongoing threat from Covid to public health is minimal, thanks to the high take-up of vaccinations and the relatively mild omicron variant. The best masks could do is have a negligible impact on slowing the inevitable: that everyone will contract Covid multiple times throughout their lives, as Professor Francois Balloux of University College London has explained.The limited benefits of continued mask mandates need to be carefully weighed up against the costs.London, like many other cities across the world, has taken a battering from Covid. Working from home turned the city into a ghost town, bars and restaurants have closed while high street shopping has markedly declined. The rise of omicron and introduction of ‘Plan B’ at the end of last year seriously undermined the nascent recovery — for which we wait to see the full impact.For some, masks are no bother at all for others, they are unbearable and a symbol of state control. The only impact of the mask mandate will be to make Covid an ever-present feature in our daily lives. This risks increasing anxiety and discouraging people from getting back to normality, and not the so-called ‘new normal’. The result may be that we see fewer people using public transport — further contributing to TfL’s mounting deficit and service reduction — while hamstringing the recovery of the capital’s struggling hospitality and retail sectors.The best we can hope for is that this does not go on for much longer. Khan must be clear about the evidential basis for mask-wearing and what data will be used to end the mask mandates. How low, exactly, do cases, hospitalisations and deaths — which are already in decline — need to fall?We should not underestimate the power and importance of cities. London has a magnetic pull, bringing together ambitious people with ideas, opportunity, and excitement. It has survived previous pandemics and has the potential to thrive once again. But to flourish it needs better leadership and less Covid theatre.Matthew Lesh is the Head of Public Policy at the Institute of Economic AffairsMore from NewsTongan \u0026#39Aquaman\u0026#39 survives tsunami and 27 hours at seaSo sweet!

The Health Secretary defended comparing the virus to flu despite over , UK deaths, saying it would become endemic in future thanks to vaccination and better treatment. He said Brits would “probably” need annual vaccinations against Covid like against flu. But he insisted he plans to axe mandatory isolation for infected people from March  - with a final decision on the date “in the next few weeks”.It comes as England’s Plan B work-from-home guidance - along with face masks in school classrooms - have both been axed as of today. From next Thursday England will also axe mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs, mandatory face masks in shops and on public transport, and face masks in communal areas of schools.The government has also vowed to scrap free lateral flow tests in future, with a leaked document suggesting this will happen from the end of June. But Mr Javid also said he would choose to wear a mask in a supermarket or on the London Underground, with guidance continuing to recommend them in enclosed spaces. And one exception is Mr Javid still plans to press ahead with plans to force frontline NHS staff to be vaccinated as a “condition of deployment” from April .Asked by Sky Newshe meant to compare Covid to flu, Mr Javid replied: “Yes”. He said: “If at the start of covid when we had no vaccines, we had no testing infrastructure, we had no treatments, people were comparing it to flu - that would’ve been wrong.” But he added: “We need to learn to live with it. Sadly people die of flu as well. In a bad flu year, you can sadly lose about , lives. “But we don’t shut down our entire country and put in place lots of restrictions to deal with it. We need to continue with our lives with sensible, appropriate and proportionate measures.  “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. We have good advice. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be. He added: “Covid is not going away. It’s going to be with us for many many years, perhaps forever, and we have to learn to live with it.”Yesterday Boris Johnson confirmed to MPs that the remaining Plan B rules in England would be allowed to expire on January  as the peak of the Omicron wave appeared to be over.The under-fire Prime Minister suggested the country was shting towards living with Covid - like flu - as he battled to save his premiership.  The PM told MPs: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we donapost place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Mr Johnson also told MPs the Government now intended to set out its long-term strategy for living with Covid- , adding: Explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances, especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives.But to make that possible we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. There are still over , people in hospital in England alone. The pandemic is not over.

Work from home guidance has been axed in England and children were allowed to take off their masks in classrooms today as experts said the Omicron wave had peaked.Next Thursday, Covid passes are no longer needed and face coverings will no longer be mandatory in indoor public spaces in England, including on public transport.  Self-isolation laws for infected people are due to expire in March - and could be axed sooner. But there were growing fears lting measures could trigger a resurgence in the highly-transmissible iant. Latest data today showed another , infections and  deaths. Union leaders believe easing curbs could backfire - and TV doctor Hilary Jones agreed.This is a worry to many, many people. Itaposs not just me who thinks itaposs too much too soon,” he told ITV ’s Good Morning Britain. “Teachers, NHS providers, the Royal College of Nursing, Unison - theyaposre all very concerned that taking away all restrictions suddenly, despite the data, is too much too soon.So what rules are being scrapped, when - and what will stay  Here’s a full run-down.Rules that are set to be scrapped January : Working from home guidance endsSince December  people were urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. But that was axed immediately in an announcement by Boris Johnson on Wednesday  January. The guidance, which was not legally binding, was a key way of getting cases down. But officials admitted it had “immediate costs to the economy”. “People should speak to their employers about arrangements for ing to the office,” the Department of Health said. There is still “working safely guidance” about how to keep Covid cases down, including ventilation and regular cleaning. January : Masks in classrooms axedEnglandaposs secondary schools had told students and staff to wear face masks in the classroom since January . Those rules have been axed as of today, with masks in communal areas continuing to be recommended for another week.Week of January : Covid travel tests could be axed for the vaccinatedVaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But Transport SecretaryGrant Shappsis looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.Any announcement is likely in the week of January , the Mirror understands. Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad. January : Compulsory masks scrapped in all settingsFace masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. All those laws will be axed at .am on Thursday  January. At the same time, so will guidance on wearing masks in school corridors and halls. But wearing a mask will still be recommended in some settings, evenit’s not legally binding.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: I think it will be sensible on the tube in London, for example - quite an enclosed space. People will be asked to make their own personal judgment just as we do in fighting flu.January : Covid passes axed for nightclubsSince December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January and will not be renewed. Covid passes can still be used by nightclubs voluntarily but this appears unlikely to be widespread.Boris Johnsonwould likely have needed to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could have been be fatal.Date not known: Definition of fully-jabbed will include a boosterThe government has repeatedly said it will update the definition of fully-jabbed to include a booster in England. While this will no longer matter for domestic Covid passes , it will matter for whether you isolate when entering the UK. Scotland already made this change for its Covid passes on January , for anyone whose second dose was at least four months ago. England has been holding out on announcing a date, because so many people had Covid over Christmas. The infections meant they were unable to get a vaccine for  days afterwards. Date not known: Daily testing for Covid contacts could be cutThe self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this week to at least five full days in England.Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, you still need to take a daily lateral flow test forsevendays .The government has said it will review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too - but has not given a date for a change.March  : Isolation for positive Covid cases scrappedBoris Johnson has announced he “very much expects” to scrap legally-binding isolation for all Covid-positive people from March . This will be a massive change, and end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive for the virus. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said the dates are not final but an announcement could be made “in the next few weeks”. Boris Johnson told MPs: “As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. The self-isolation regulations expire on th March, at which point I very much expect not to renew them. Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards.Spring : Shutting down PCR testing centresLocal Covid testing centres will start to be shut down from the spring, according to The Times. Since the multi-billion pound Test and Trace programme was set up, a huge network of testing centres has ballooned in places like car parks. The average person in England travels just . miles to get a test. Ministers reportedly accept this cannot be sustained long-term, with a source telling The Times: “The wind-down will be quite swt and will mean fewer test centres because we donapost need all of the sites.”End of June : Free lateral flow tests scrappedThe government made clear in autumn  that at some point, free mass lateral flow tests would end and people would start having to pay. Now a leaked document has suggested officials have pencilled in a date of the end of June, after it was put back from Spring amid an outcry. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Lateral flow tests remain free to use and we continue to encourage people to access them. “At a later stage the Government, as our response to the virus evolves, universal free provision of things like lateral flow tests will end and we will update once we are in that position. Thereaposs been no decision made on when that will be.”Rules that are set to stay Guidance on masks and testingDespite most laws being axed in England, there is likely to still be guidance on keeping yourself and vulnerable relatives safe. This can include keeping rooms well-ventilated, meeting outdoors where possible and taking a lateral flow test before you go. The government added: “Public health guidance will remain in place, suggesting iniduals should continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with people you do not normally meet.”Compulsory vaccines for NHS and care staff Covid vaccines will be made mandatory for all frontlineNHSstaff in England from April  as a “condition of deployment”.It is already a condition of deployment in care homes despite fears of mass staff shortages, which have prompted a relaxation of immigration rules. The Department of Health and Social Care accepted there may be a “signicant” hit to the workforce as millions are told ‘no jab, no job’. A government impact statement has now estimated , health and care staff could refuse to be vaccinated under the policy, without having a medical exemption. But Mr Javid said NHS staff already need vaccines against other illnesses and it will protect patients.Regular booster vaccinesScientists have repeatedly said there will be an annual booster programme for Covid, either for the whole population or just the vulnerable. Sajid Javid said: “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be.”Keeping powers in reserveJust because legal powers are axed, it does not mean they won’t be brought back. The government has the power to lay Covid restrictions at any time under public health laws dating back to .

He also claimed Mr Reynolds himself promised to speak to Boris Johnson about concerns ahead of the event.  The revelations add to the pressure on Boris Johnson as he prepares for Ms Gray’s long-awaited report to be released next week.Mr Cummings has accused him of lying to Parliament by claiming he “implicitly believed” the May  party where he spent  minutes was a work event.The Tory leader faces a weekend in limbo after several Tory MPs decided to wait until Ms Gray’s report before sending a letter of no confidence. A government source told the Times Ms Gray - who was due to interview Mr Cummings - is “genuinely struggling to reconcile” the Prime Minister’s account with that of other interviewees. “It’s very dficult for her,” the source added. It’s understood Sue Gray has not yet handed her findings to Downing Street and is currently unlikely to do so before next week.  No then has control over the timing of publication. Officials have promised to reveal Ms Gray’s report quickly and Boris Johnson will give a statement to Parliament. But despite the PM’s spokesman saying earlier this week “I think it will be published in full”, the report appears likely to redact names of staff -they are included at all. It is possible the report given to No will not go into line-by-line detail about who did what and when, instead presenting a summary or broad-brush findings to the PM. The terms of reference suggest Ms Gray will only establish a “general understanding of the nature of the gatherings”, though this can include the “attendance, setting and purpose”. While she can recommend disciplinary action against inidual staff, this would be kept secret - and Ms Gray cannot rule directly on whether Boris Johnson broke ethics rules. Any breach by Boris Johnson would have to be investigated by separate advisor Lord Geidt - who can only investigate with the PM’s permission, and whose findings can be overruled by the PM. Asked todaythe Sue Gray report would be published in full, the PM’s spokesman said today: “The Prime Minister has promised to publish that in the House and that remains the case.”  Earlier this week he replied to the same question by saying “yes, we’ve committed to publishing it in the House.” He added: “I think it will be published in full.” However, it’s understood there could be redactions ordered by Sue Gray’s team itself. Mr Cummings revealed the existence of the e-mail reply to Martin Reynolds on his blog on Monday. He wrote: “On  May, after the PPS sent the invitation to the drinks party, a very senior official replied by email saying the invite broke the rules. “This email will be seen by Sue Gray .” No have denied Mr Johnson saw or was alerted to Mr Reynolds’ original email invite. Dominic Cummings tweeted today: “Episode  of no saying aposcummings lyingapos then evidence shows no is lying... “NB Broadcasters shd now assume no is lying unless strong reason to think contrary, given lying is default mode as regime implodes.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRobert PestonMartin ReynoldsBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Senior Conservative William Wragg accused No, special advisers and whips of blackmail against MPs unhappy with Boris Johnson.In an explosive statement in Parliament, he suggested rebels should report their concerns to the police. The Prime Minister said he had seen no evidence to support any of those allegations as he visited a diagnostics centre in Taunton. He said he would of course look for evidence to support Mr Wraggaposs allegations.  But Mr Wakeford revealed that he was told he would lose out on a schoolhe didnapost toe the line.He told BBC North West: I was threatened that I would not get the school for RadclfeI did not vote in one particular way.This is a town thataposs not had a high school for the best part of  years. How would you feel when holding back regeneration of a town for a vote  It didnapost sit comfortably and that was really starting to question my place where I was and ultimately to where I am now. A Labour source said the vote in question related to free school meals. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke claimed the Tory defector was not a neutral source on allegations of intimidation. He told Times Radio: Itaposs either something he can substantiate or it isnapost. I think thataposs the point. And I simply need to see any evidence that that has in fact occurred. I think we have to accept objectively here that Mr Wakeford is not entirely a neutral source on these matters, having made the decision that he has. The Manchester Evening News reported in February  that the long awaited high school in Radclfe had been approved by the Government as one of four new free schools to have been given the green light across Greater Manchester Labouraposs Jonathan Ashworth accused the Government of being rotten to the core.  The Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary said: Tories play politics with the le chances of young people. Boris Johnson’s government is rotten to the core. Mr Wragg, the Tory chairman of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, sparked the explosive row when he revealed that he had received reports members of staff at  Downing Street, special advisers, government ministers and others encouraging the publication of stories in the press seeking to embarrass those who they suspect of lacking confidence in the Prime Minister. He said the whips were responsible for pushing forward Government business but added: It is not theirto breach the ministerial code in threatening to withdraw investments from members of parliamentaposs constituencies which are funded from the public purse. Mr Wragg told the Commons hearing: The intimidation of a Member of Parliament is a serious matter. Reports of which I am aware would seem to constitute blackmail.  As such it would be my general advice to colleagues to report these matters to the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Commissioner of politan Police. The senior backbencher is among the Tories who have publicly confirmed that they have submitted letters of no confidence in the PM. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said it could be a contempt of Parliament to block MPs from doing their work - and warned that MPs and their staff are not above the criminal law. While the whipping system is long-established, it is of course a contempt to obstruct members in the discharge of their duty or to attempt to intimidate a member in their parliamentary conduct by threats, he said. But Tory MP Michael Fabrican branded Mr Wraggaposs comments nonsense. If I reported every time I had been threatened by a whip ora whip reported every time I had threatened them, the police wouldnapost have any time to conduct any other police work, he said. A No  spokesperson said: We are not aware of any evidence to support what are clearly serious allegations. If there is any evidence to support these claims we would look at it very carefully.

Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves slammed the Prime Minister for leading a party which prioritises its party above the needs of the country. Making her speech from Bury, the heart of the Red Wall, Ms Reeves said: “The [Conservative] party is not of productive business, but of crony capitalism. She recalled the PM’s expletive remarks when asked about business concerns post-Brexit and said it’s how he’s organised the government. “When the Prime Minister said ‘F- business’, I thought it was a throwaway remark. Little did I know it would be the central organising principle of his government.  And what’s left  A government of waste - wasted money, wasted talent and wasted potential. This calls for a new contract between the government and the British people.”Ms Reevesapos contract - the latest to be unveiled from the Labour Party - includes plans to scrub up Britain’s industries aiming to increase British manufacturing, create more apprenticeships for young people and to invest in Britain.Describing the last decade as “lost” thanks to successive Conservative governments she said it’s been a “vicious circle” of dficulty. Here are some of the main things she said.A secure economyThe Shadow Chancellor promised to give Brits a future with a secure economy.This will only come from more investment, according to Ms Reeves. She said: Where the Conservatives scrapped their own Industrial Strategy Council, Labour will create an industrial strategy built on an ethos of cooperation across the public and private sectors, employers and workers. To unlock the brilliance of our leading businesses and entrepreneurs, mobilising these to create good work and economic growth in every part of Britain, and ensure that our communities can take pride in great British industries. The healthcare business industry will be revitalisedMs Reeves said: If we want to drive up national productivity then it’s not only a few businesses at the leading edge which need to feel the benefits of new technologies and investment. Those foundations provide us with security as a society - especially when a crisis hits. That calls for industrial strategies for sectors like care which have too often been overlooked, breaking loose of our cycle of long hours, low pay and low productivity, with a new deal for work.No plans to call a by-election over Tory defectorMs Reeves followed the party line and said Labour had no plans to call a by-election.Speaking in front of the new Labour MP Mr Wakeford she said Brits in his constiuency put a tick by his name.Instead she called on the Government to call a General Election to allow Brits to express how they really feel. Christian, like so many others, sees that our country needs Keir Starmer ’s leadership and a Labour government now more than ever, she said.Mr Wakeford had welcomed Ms Reeves onto the stage in his first speech as a Labour MP. He told his constituents he will always put their priorities first and he believes in Labour. EducationMs Reeves echoed Keir Starmeraposs plans to ensure every young person leaves school ready for the world of work. She went a step further and said Labour plans to expand opportunities for school leavers. The Shadow Chancellor saidLabour was in Government theyaposd create apprenticeship opportunities for young people - which could have seen one hundred thousand extra apprenticeships created this year - to drive our economic recovery.

Last week, they opposed Labour’s plans to stop anti-vax protests threatening teachers and children outside schools. This week, they tried to bring in powers to stop and search anyone in a peaceful protest. Instead of taking sensible action to keep people safe, they are targeting peaceful protestors and bystanders. It’s a mess. Stronger action is clearly needed to protect schools and vaccine clinics from threatening anti-vax groups. Children shouldn’t face intimidation on the way into school and NHS staff shouldn’t face threats or abuse on the way into work, especially when their job is saving lives. There have also been recent reports that one group has been doing combat training. That’s why Labour put forward proposals to offer councils fast-track powers to set up protection zones around schools and vaccine clinics. People have a right to protest but they don’t have a right to intimidate others, especially children. Shockingly, the Conservatives voted against those proposals.  Labour also supported stronger action against dangerous demonstrations on motorways like the irresponsible Insulate Britain protests last year. Someone could have been killed. No one has a right to put lives at risk, so Labour Lords voted this week for stronger sentences for protests on motorways and A-roads. The police and courts also already have many existing powers to deal with serious disruption from protests and we called for better guidance and training for police on how they should be used. But instead of focusing on protests that are threatening, violent or put other people’s safety at risk, the Government is trying to silence peaceful protesters. Under their plans, peaceful protestors objecting to the closure of a local swimming pool or maternity unit could be stopped and searched by police for no reason at all. Anyone passing by a protest, to get to work, or to take a child to school, could also be stopped and searched without suspicion. Protestors could also be stopped for being noisy. We know that this Tory Government doesn’t like being challenged, but potentially criminalising people just for singing or chanting undermines Britain’s important freedoms and rights.  Rightly, the House of Lords voted against these plans this week. From the suffragettes to the Countryside Alliance, people have always had a right to object publicly to things that governments or big corporations do, whether ministers like it or not. Throughout history, it is how some of our important freedoms have been won. The Conservatives are giving us the worst of all worlds - trying to silence peaceful protesters, but not taking action on anti-vaxxers intimidating children. They need to think again. Labour’s contract with the British people has respect and security at its heart. That means respecting Britainaposs long-standing democratic traditions and standing up for public safety and security at the same time.

Several potential defectors are being wooed by the party in the aftermath of Christian Wakeford’s bombshell switch, it is understood.Sources warned against any imminent defection - but one suggested there could be a breakthrough in future. The source said the door is always open, adding: “I’m not expecting an imminent second one - but that doesn’t mean there won’t be one. “We’ll have to see what happens over the next few weeks.”  The PM’s position temporarily stabilised following Mr Wakeford’s dramatic decision, with claims some no-confidence letters had been withdrawn. Backbench MP Andrew Percy said Mr Wakeford’s defection had “kind of made people a bit more relaxed, itaposs calmed nerves”. He added: “I think people have recognised that actually this constant navel gazing and internal debating is only to the advantage of our political opponents. “The Prime Minister is probably thanking Christian for what he did because itaposs made a lot of people think again, think twice.But Mr Wakeford was in talks with Labour for months, pre-dating Partygate after he privately voiced concerns about the direction of the government.And today’s Tory unity may just be a stay of execution as No braces for next week’s make-or-break investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray.Senior Tory William Wragg, who has already called for Mr Johnson to quit, today accused government figures of aposblackmailapos to persuade MPs to stay loyal.  Veteran Tories could seal Mr Johnson’s fate next week after the report is published. Insiders fear it will not fully clear the PM. Itaposs not going to be as good as people think,” a Government source told the Times. “Sheaposs genuinely struggling to reconcile the Prime Ministeraposs claim that this was a work event with what sheaposs been hearing from other people. “Itaposs very dficult for her. One Labour source said: “There are obviously a number of people on the Tory benches who are feeling uncomfortable with their current position, and reflecting on whether they’re in the right.“It’s a massive show of confidence in the Labour Party that someone who’s been in the Conservative Party can see this is a party serious about government.”But they warned against any imminent new defections and said: “Other people have expressed dissatisfaction with where they are but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll cross the floor - it takes a tremendous amount of courage to do that.”  A second source said: “I don’t think there’s any imminently because it’s such a big political thing. “The first one is the hardest - no one doing it for  years creates a kind of aura about it that’s quite hard to break. But it’s a big thing to do regardless... I’m not aware of anyone whose headspace is ‘I’m in the wrong party’.”Health Secretary Sajid Javid desperately tried to shore up the PM, saying he thought Mr Johnson was secure in his post - despite calls from some Tory MPs for him to resign over Downing Street lockdown parties.Askedthe PM was safe in his job, Mr Javid said: Yes, I think he is. At the same time, people are right to be angered and pained about what they have seen and they have heard. I share that anger and pain. “I think it is right that there is a proper investigation going on that will establish the facts and that the Prime Minister will come back to Parliament and properly respond. Mr Javid called for Mr Wakeford to trigger a by-election in his Bury South seat.  Mr Javid admitted David Davisaposs call for the PM to quit was damaging for Mr Johnson.The former Brexit Secretary quoted from the  Norway Debate when he urged Mr Johnson to stand aside, telling him In the name of God, go.Mr Javid conceded: It is damaging, of course it is. The Health Secretary also said thatMr Johnson was found to have broken the law he would have to go. The Ministerial Code is very clear. If any minister from the Prime Minister down breaks the law, of course they shouldnapost continue to serve as a minister, he said. What I have just said is a general rule that applies to everyone. There is no exception to that rule. He admitted the scandal had damaged UK democracy. If there were people at the heart of government who were not following the rules, absolutely they should be disciplined and I look forward to seeing that disciplinary action taking place, he said. We do now know there were some parties. We know that because some of the people that were involved and broke the rules have come forward to say so. Of course things like this damage our democracy.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLabour PartyDavid DavisBoris JohnsonCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Angry Red Wall MPs have been heaping pressure on the Prime Minister as Westminster buzzes with rumours over how many letters of no confidence have gone into the Tory backbench  Committee. Only  chairman Sir Graham Brady knows the true number but tensions are running high as Boris Johnson tries to win over his mutinous MPs. Six senior Tories have openly called for Mr Johnson to quit but reports of a Red Wall rebellion are adding to the PMaposs woes. Dubbed the pork pie plot as a meeting was hosted by the Melton MP Alicia Kearns, it underlines the level of anger among some of the  intake.And Bury South MP Christian Wakeford dramatically abandoned the Tories for the Labour Party on Wednesday. Here we look the new rebels making le dficult for Boris Johnson. What is a aposRed Wallapos Tory MP  The term loosely refers to the Conservatives who won their seats off Labour during Boris Johnsonaposs  election landslide. The Red Wall is a nickname for Labouraposs traditional heartlands in England and Wales, particularly seats in the North of England, North Wales and the Midlands . A swathe of these seats turned Tory in , including Tony Blairaposs old seat of Sedgefield, in Co Durham, Blyth Valley in Northumberland and Workington in Cumbria. These MPs were perceived as loyal to Boris Johnson but discontent has been mounting over broken promises on levelling up and rail reform. Partygate has also landed badly with voters, and some of these new MPs may be feeling vulnerable going into the next election. Who are the Pork Pie plotters  Alicia Kearns The former Foreign Office official has been outspoken about the UK’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the handling of the crisis by senior civil servants. Ms Kearns, , MP for Rutland and Melton has hosted meetings of anti-Johnson plotters - leading to the plan being named after Melton Mowbray’s most famous export. Her , majority in the safe blue East Midlands seat allows her the luxury of plotting.  Dehenna Davison The PM’s then girlfriend and now we Carrie was pictured campaigning with Ms Davison in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham in the run-up to the  ballot. The -year-oldaposs stunning victory was the first time the Tories had won the seat in nearly  years. The arch Brexiteer presents a GB News show with ex-UKIP chief Nigel Farage.  Gary Sambrook The Birmingham Northfield MP is a Covid passport rebel and said the PM must consider his positionhe is found to have broken lockdown laws. As secretary of the  Committee, Mr Sambrook, , would be one of the MPs responsible for running a no-confidence vote and subsequent leadership race. Chris Loder The former train guard, , worked his way up through the industry to become head of new trains for South Western Railway. His majority of , in the Conservative stronghold of West Dorset should make him electorally immune to fury at the PM and Partygate. Christian WakefordThe Bury South MP didnapost attend the meeting but he became the first Red Wall Tory to say publicly that he had submitted a latter of no confidence.Within  hours he had defected to Labour, dramatically joining the party for Prime Ministeraposs Questions on Wednesday.In an excoriating letter to Boris Johnson, he said: Britain needs a Government focused on tackling the cost-of-living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a Government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and Government this country deserves.He added: My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.

Sir Graham Brady, chair of the all-important  Committee made up of Tory backbenchers, has not yet received the magical  letters that would trigger a vote of no confidence. Political pundits believe many Tories are now awaiting the results of the Gray investigation before deciding whether or not to pull that trigger.  Johnsonaposs alleged contempt for the rules put in place to help prevent the spread of coronavirus over the past two years has caused anger throughout the nation.In response to the frustration - which stems from millions of Brits making huge sacrices, including not being able to be with elderly loved ones - an investigation has been launched into the string of gatherings. At the helm of investigation sits Sue Gray, the most powerful person youaposve never heard of.Who is Sue Gray   Senior civil servant Sue Gray served as Director General of Propriety and Ethics in the Cabinet Office between  and .Before this, she worked in the departments of Transport, Health and Work and Pensions. After these roles, she took a career break in the late s to run a pub in Northern Ireland before joining the Cabinet Office in the s.She now holds the role of the Second Permanent Secretary to the Cabinet Office, a role charged with leading on the Union and the Constitution.When is the Sue Gray report into Downing Street party allegations   The report is now expected to be released no sooner than Monday next week - the exact date remains to be confirmed. PM Johnson confirmed the report is expected next week during his embattled PMQs on January .The reason no one has any hard and fast answers about the reportaposs release date stems from the additional revelations cropping up about more parties alleged to have taken place. What does the Sue Gray investigation cover   The primary purpose of Grayaposs report is, according to the Cabinet Office, to: Establish swtly a general understanding of the nature of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.The scope of the report initially set out to cover the Downing Street Christmas parties on November  and December , but the number of dates under the microscope has now been extended to include two parties that took place on the night before Prince Philipaposs funeral on April . According to the terms of reference set out for the investigation: Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be investigated.They also state that: If required, the investigations will establish whether inidual disciplinary action is warranted. The terms set out that investigators will have access to documents and will be able to speak to staff throughout its course. It is now understood that Grayaposs investigation will now include an interview with Johnsonaposs former aide, Dominic Cummins over the claims he made that that the PM lied to Parliament.Is the Sue Gray investigation independent  One key concern remains, however, about the independence of the investigation. This is because despite being at the heart of Grayaposs explorations, Boris Johnson is also the person who gets to decidethe next stage of the investigation can actually go ahead.After Grayaposs report, Johnson will have the final say as to whether the Prime Minister’s advisor on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, can actually start an investigation into any breaches of ministerial code.Speaking on the matter, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “The PM has set the terms of Sue Gray’s probe and he has chosen to exclude the conduct of Ministers from it, creating a neat loophole for himself.“Any judgement on the conduct of Boris Johnson goes to... Boris Johnson. “A farcical circular process from a Prime Minister that will escape responsibility in any way he can.

Labour leader Keir Starmer said: I would like to welcome Christian Wakeford to the Labour Party. He has always put the people of Bury South first.But Health Secretary Sajid Javid told Sky News: “I feel sorry for the people of Bury South. I think a by-election would be welcome… I think Christian should be happy with a by-election”. He added: “They’ve got an MP who’s changed his affiliation without their permission”. Labour has indicated there will not be a by-election. So what do the voters of Bury South think  We spoke to them.  In the town of Prestwich, which sits in the Bury South constituency, there was a mixed response today to Christian Wakeford’s defection from Tory to Labour. Sham Raja, , said: “It’s so shameful. He signed up to be a Conservative MP. It’s disgraceful, he was elected under the Conservative banner.“There are lots of small businesses struggling at the moment and he’s said nothing about this. Boris Johnson was the only guy to bring us out of Europe and get Brexit done.“I think he should step down as an MP andhe wants to be a Labour MP, he should apply to be one. “He’s not won on a Labour  and he should take it upon himself to step down.” Jeremy Burtles, , said: “There should be another election – you can’t just switch. If you want to change parties, you need to step down. “You always vote for the party you want in charge so I think it’s ridiculous to switch all of a sudden. “If you’re going to change your view, you should just step down.” And Hazel Donnelly, , said: “I don’t think it was very good at all, he shouldn’t be allowed to do that.  “It won’t change the way I vote because I am a Conservative. “I don’t think it’s a big deal what Boris did - there are much worse things that have happened recently. “There should be certain rules with these things. I think he has broken a rule but there are more important things going on at the moment.” But Barry Humphries, , backed the MPaposs decision. He said: “Good for him, I think he’s doing what’s right for him and he’s standing up for what he believes in.” And Ifkan Ahmed, , added: “I’ve always been happy with him. I think these days it’s okay to change your policies. “He has been very good for our area and I’m happy with what he’s done. It doesn’t matter to me that he has changed.”  Vickie Stone, , said: “If he wants to do it because of Boris Johnson then I think that’s fair enough. “If he doesn’t agree with the way Boris is handling the situation then that’s up to him. “I’m more bothered about the leadership, I’m worried about who is going to replace Borisit ends up going that way.” In Radclfe, the centre of the constituency, the MPaposs office, painted in true-blue Tory colours, was shuttered. Outside on the street, ex-Labour and current Tory voter Mavis Leach said: Well, Iaposm surprised. Are there others doing it, as well, getting out of a sinking ship before it goes down  Mrs Leach, who said she disavowed Labour because of a dislike for former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said Boris Johnson should stay on as Prime Minister.I know heaposs done wrong, done a lot of things wrong, she said. Boris has done a lot of things. We know that. But I think heaposs done a good job in other things,bringing the vaccinations in, and weaposre in a good place for that. Another local, Jonathan Boston, a Labour supporter, said Mr Wakefordaposs change in loyalty is really good news. Presumably, itaposs all to do with partygate, he said, referring to allegations of lockdown-busting parties within No , though a Labour spokesman has since said talks with Mr Wakeford began before the scandal hit. Mr Boston said: From what one hears, all the MPs have had millions of emails from constituents saying, aposItaposs terrible and heaposs got to go,apos so I donapost think any Tory voter, even in Radclfe, or Bury South or whatever, would be surprised at .probably the first of many, I would have thought, especially the newer MPs. I think a lot of the newer ones will do a similar thing. Meanwhile, Chris Holland said he rated Mr Wakeford as a local MP but had not voted for him. He said: Iaposve never voted Tory and I never would do. Iaposve messaged him a few times and he has got back to me. To me, heaposs not been doing too bad. Iaposd rather have a Labourthan a Tory. David Collins, who runs Marieaposs Coffee Shop, a stoneaposs throw from Mr Wakefordaposs constituency office, said: I probably wouldnapost vote for either of them anyway, Labour or Conservative. Theyaposre all as bad as each other. They all promise theyaposre going to do things and none of it ever materialises, does it  You wouldnapost think you were able to jump ship halfway through, would you   Tory voter Joan Humphreys said she feels like her tick at the ballot box has now been wasted. She said: I feel like going down there and saying, aposRight. I want to withdraw it.apos If he wants to become Labour, and he wants to support Labouraposs policies, we should have a by-election and see what the people say. If Boris had held his hands up at the beginning, people would have been far more forgiving about it, but heaposs not. But who are you going to have instead of Boris  I canapost see anybody .

But when her eldest child learned about the attacks at school, she faced up to her traumaLisa was just  when two planes crashed into the Twin TowersByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Jan | commentsA woman who survived   has revealed she couldnapost look at photos of the attack for over a decade after it happened. Lisa Ridd was just  when two planes plunged into the World Trade Centre in New York on  September, . She was just yards from the Twin Towers when the planes hit - and recalls she originally thought the fuss around her was down to a parade nearby. Speaking to FEMAIL, Lisa said she only realised the true horror of what was happening when she saw a plane flying towards her. She recalled: Somebody said something about a bomb I thought Thataposs ridiculous, but quickly the older, more seasoned people on the trading floor told me to get off the phone - we are evacuating. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here After coming out onto the street, Lisa and hundreds of others started running as they saw the second plane heading for the North Tower. Somehow amid the chaos, she managed to find her sister who also worked in the World Trade Centre, and retreated to her apartment for safety. Although she survived the massacre, her best friend Lindsay, who worked on the th floor of the South Tower, did not. The pair had made friends four years earlier while studying at university in Massachusetts. According to Lisa, Lindsay was the biggest light in the room. But Lisa didnapost find out her best friendaposs fate until days after the attack, while she was recovering from the shock at her parentsapos house in Virginia.  As more stories emerged of survivors being pulled from the rubble, Lisa became convinced Lindsay would be one of them. For days she continued to call Lindsayaposs phone, willing her to pick up. But on  September when Lindsayaposs mum called to discuss her daughteraposs funeral arrangements, it sunk in for Lisa that her university pal was gone. Over the next few months, Lisa was offered counselling at work to process the trauma of being caught up in the terror attack, but she refused it. In fact, she recalls she avoided the topic entirely.  For the next decade, she couldnapost read about the attacks in the newspaper, look at photos of the Twin Towers or talk about what sheaposd lived through. While she suppressed her memories, Lisa met her now-husband and had three children, aged , six and two. But when her eldest child came home one day and asked her about  , Lisa realised she needed to make peace with her trauma. I was like aposOkay I guess I need to tell my kids my storyaposapos, she said. Since sitting her children down to tell them about her experience, Lisa has also gone back to the World Trade Centre and spent time at the memorial to the victims of  . She said: You have no idea when you see photos how powerful it is. There are holes that will never be filled up. All you can hear is the water rushing through, water is so therapeutic anyway and the way they designed it it feels like cleansing an endless cycle of energy. All of your senses are just alive and I really could not think of a more beautul way to memorialise that spot.

Armed Forces minister James Heappey warned tens of thousands could diewar breaks outVladimir Putin seems intent of rebuilding an influential Russian empire Image: SPUTNIK AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Jan | comments All-out war between Russia and Ukraine appears imminent, and British brass hats can’t wait to join in.Armed Forces minister James Heappey talks blithely of the “grave possibility” of war with “tens of thousands dying.” Britain this week deployed an undisclosed number of Army personnel to the front line, a no manaposs land of freezing First World War-style trenches. They’re equipped with latest anti-tank weapons for use against the Red Army. They’re there to train Ukrainian soldiers, says the MoD, not to fight. But this is how wars begin. It’s called mission creep. The Americans were only in Vietnam to train local forces, until they weren’t. And look what happened.  If British soldiers come under direct fire, they must defend themselves. Then what  RAF sorties to take out attacking Russian forces  More, and bigger, military involvement  Tory MPs led by ex-officer Tobias Ellwood have formed a Charge of the Fight Brigade, egging on the military. How long before Boris Johnson begins to parade as the true successor to liberator Thatcher  But Donetsk isn’t British. This isn’t the Falklands. I’m no pacist –we’re invaded, stick a rle in my hands – and I hold no brief for dictator Vladimir Putin. His ambition to rebuild a Russian empire of influence from the ruins of the USSR is clear. But this is not our fight. They are not at the gates of Greenwich, and Nato is a reliable bulwark against any such danger. The Germans, who have much more to lose from a conflict close to their borders, promise “everything short of war”: punitive sanctions to hit the Russian economy hard. We should do the same. The coal mines of the Donbas are not worth the le of a single British soldier.

After more backlash, they have now urged parents to raise concerns in a more formal manner.  A statement from the school read: Almost  years ago, the school made a commitment to an affordable unorm policy, and we believe the current unorm is one of the cheapest to buy in the region and complies with the affordable school unorm legislation being introduced this year. The coat was chosen and designed by students in  and costs £. The school is confident that students are not sitting in classrooms that are unusually cold for the time of year and students should not need to wear coats to keep warm. Additionally, all students have access to an indoor space and or classroom during any breaks.  We hope that parents and the wider community appreciate that governors and school leaders are trying to do their best in what has been an exceptionally dficult period for us all. Governors hope that parents will use the school complaints policythey have a concern. Such complaints can be dealt with formally and carefully and without some of the upsetting, abusive and inflammatory language that has been directed at staff and governors. Parents complained about the cost and quality of the branded windcheater which costs £. One angry mum fumed: “They confiscated his my sonaposs coat yesterday - outside - which I thought was absolutely ludicrous. He has asthma, which he is on constant medication for, so getting cold does him no good whatsoever. Because he went and got his coat back because he was cold, he has been put into isolation, that was his punishment. “Why would you take a coat off a child when you know they’ve got asthma  She added: “Kids should not be worried about getting into trouble for keeping warm.

The Articial Intelligence programme would offer results within minutes and would be a big boost to healthcare staff, it has been claimed. Experts at the University of the West of Scotland say the speed of results would aid the frontline battle against the deadly bug.A PCR test typically takes around two hours to inform of a positive or negative result. But the Articial Intelligence programme detects the virus much faster and the idea would boost hospital care around the world.  An AI process uses an algorithm to analyse visual imagery and make a quick diagnosis. Professor Naeem Ramzan led the three-person team behind the project, which also involved Gabriel Okolo and Dr Stamos Katsigiannis.In his latest update, he wrote: There has long been a need for a quick and reliable tool that can detect Covid-, and this has become even more true with the upswing of the Omicron iant.Several countries are unable to carry out large numbers of covid tests because of limited diagnosis tools, but this technique utilises easily accessible technology to quickly detect the virus.  Covid- symptoms are not visible in x-rays during the early stages of infection, so it is important to note that the technology cannot fully replace PCR tests. However, it can still play an important role in curtailing the viruses spread especially when PCR tests are not readily available. It could prove to be crucial, and potentially le-saving, when diagnosing severe cases of the virus, helping determine what treatment may be required.  Professor Milan Radosavljevic, Vice-Principal of Research, Innovation and Engagement at UWS, hailed the signicance of the development. This is potentially game-changing research, he said. Itaposs another example of the purposeful, impactful work that has gone on at UWS throughout the pandemic, making a genuine dference in the fight against Covid-. I am incredibly proud of the drive and innovation demonstrated by our internationally renowned academics, as they strive to find solutions to urgent global problems.

Image: MEN MEDIAByGraeme Murray:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan | commentsDozens of pets have been left aposlimp, leless and vomitingapos as a mystery dog illness spreads. Nicola Jane took her lurcher along a canal towpath and he became ill only hours later..The six-month old dog contracted an infection which almost killed him for five days after the walk.A friendaposs dog which she was also exercising also became ill but managed to recover after they were exercised at Hunslet Canal., Yorkshire.The animals both had symptoms within four hours of the walk and aposseemed off.Hundred of dogs have experienced similar symptoms prompting vet warnings to avoid coastal walks. Cases have been reported at Hayling Island beach and Langstone Harbour in Hampshire, Fraisthorpe Beach in East Riding, Bridlington and Redcar beach.  Nicola, of Leeds, West Yorkshire said aposI woke up around am on night four, and just thought I was losing him. I thought he was dead, he was shaking and being sick, he was limp in my arms I thought he wasnapost coming back from this. At that point in the night I took him to the emergency vet, I was really shocked with the numbers that were there. I was terried.apos The Daily Mail reports that blood tests were carried out and the vet kept the pet overnight and monitored IV fluids.Nicola added: He is a mess, he is like a skeleton he is that skinny. He lost that much weight. There was nothing on him, no le, he was limp, I thought he was gone, I thought I was losing him. Vets told her a virus which was originally from beaches was spreading.  The animal doctors warned her to avoid the popular dog walking areas at the coast because it is spreading from dog to dog very quickly.Earlier this month The Mirror told about a more than a hundred dog illnesses which had struck down animals. Veterinary nurse Brogan Proud, who runs Yorkshire Coast Pet Care posted a message on Facebook where she said that she had been inundated with ill dogs that have been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea.She said that local authorities were investigating what is behind the illness and that worryingly a lot more dogs have been affected than she previously thought as more people have contacted her. As itaposs gone so public, it just seems to be much higher numbers than I thought. I know the local authorities have been testing, they canapost find anything as of yetBefore that incident The Mirror reported animals had been affected in Yorkshire.Vet practices in the region then shared warnings on Facebook, urging owners to avoid beaches in Scarborough and Saltburn.The bug was then thought to be moving inland to towns and cities, including Hebden Bridge, York, and Sheffield, reported similar symptoms. One person posted on a group in Hebden Bridge saying: The dog sickness bug is spreading here like wildfire. My dog came down it on Thursday and I had only taken her to school and back! Relatives of Nicola, , have also had their dogs admitted to the vets, some for three days. Dog owners told how his Great Dane died after contracting lung infection from swimming in apospollutedapos sea water. David Arthuraposs -month-old dog Odin swam at Hayling Island in Portsmouth, Hampshire, but had to be put to down because of the infection He had already spent £, on treating Odin but the animalaposs lungs were damaged from pneumonia, with the sea thought to be the likely cause of infection. A £, vet bill faced the owner of another dog after her Staffordshire bull terrier swam in polluted sea water. Nalu was infected after swimming at Langstone which terried her owner Louisa Moss. The pooch became so ill she had to be put on a ventilator and was struggling to breathe and her owners were told she might die.

The girl is the first female born to the Smiths since Gwens daughter Sandra was born in Gwen Smith met her great-great-granddaughter MaevaByAdam AspinallNews Reporter:,  Jan | comments A -year-old pensioner has welcomed her great-great-granddaughter into the world - the first girl born into the family for  years.Gwen Smith met little Maeva for the first time - the first female born to the Smiths since her daughter Sandra was born in . Five generations of the family were able to get together at the Dene Holm Residential Care Home in Northfleet, Kent, as the oldest and youngest members could be united for the first time. Gwen, who will turn  next month, already has five grandsons, eight great-grandsons and six step great-grandsons and she was extremely proud to meet the newest addition to the family. Unfortunately, her cataracts mean she can no longer see very well but she was still tremendously happy to meet Maeva. Gwen’s family said: “It was a very special occasion to get all five generations together, particularly during the pandemic. Strict protocols are still in place but the home’s manager, Chris, permitted the visit for which we are all extremely grateful.”  Gwen was born in Essex on th February , she moved to Gravesend as a youngster and went to school in Northfleet. A keen dancer in her youth, she performed at many local events while working her father’s shop. Gwen met her husband, Ron, an apprentice electrician at Blue Circle Cement Works, when she was . They married in  but with Ron sent to serve overseas with the Royal Engineers, they didn’t meet again for another five years. When they were finally reunited, the pair enjoyed many years of travelling whilst bringing up their two daughters, Gloria and Sandra. A care home spokesman said: It can be dficult to get several generations of family together at the best of times but with an ongoing pandemic, it’s even trickier. But thanks to the staff at the Dene Holm Road care home, Gwen’s family were able to come and visit her together, to introduce her to baby Maeva. It was a very rare occasion and indeed, incredibly special for the whole family, particularly as little Maeva is the first girl to be born to the family since Gwen’s daughter, Sandra,  years ago.

Despite this, the virus continues to be rampant and risk of infections still remains high. When someone catches Covid, their immune system usually generates a response that helps their body fight off the virus and protects them from future infections. However, some people end up getting re-infected as their immunity begins to wane.So,youaposve recently caught Covid and youaposre wondering how long you might remain immune to it before the risk of catching it again - hereaposs everything you need to know. How soon can I catch Covid again   After someone catches Covid, their bodies builds antibodies that help fight against the virus. However, itaposs not known how long immunity from infection lasts, and it can also y from person to person.A recent Public Health Englandstudy found that more people who have had coronavirus are protected from catching it again for at least five months.However, a government website states that a new infection could occur within  days - or three months - of being infected once. This would be mean that people who have the virus in October could be vulnerable to catching it again this month. Sometimes, the immune response doesnapost last as long as five or three months and people end up getting re-infected twice in one month. The Omicron iant, which has more mutations than previous iants, is thought to be more likely to cause reinfection than iants like Delta. However, UK studies are yet to look into Omicron re-infection rates in more detail. Itaposs worth noting that residual signs of Covid infection can show up on a PCR test for up to three months, evena person is not displaying any symptoms. Do I need to self-isolateIaposve already had Covid before   Yes,you have symptoms of Covid or have tested positive for the virus, you will need to self-isolate, evenyou have already contracted the virus in the past few months. You will also need to self-isolateyouaposve not been vaccinated and live with someone who has tested positive. This applies evenyou have had recently been infected, as this would be a new infection and you are considered contagious again. Guidelines from Gov.uk state: If an inidual is re-tested  days or more after their initial illness onset or prior test date, and is found to be PCR positive, this should be considered as a possible new infection.

The footage of Primrose Court in Huyton, Merseyside has racked up more than five million views.A voiceover on the video, which was created by a TikTok user scrolling on Google Street View, says: Look at the f****** state of this street in Liverpool.It shows derelict homes with their windows boarded back in September , while music from the horror film Dead Silence plays over the top of it.Residents living in the area told the Liverpool Echo they feared for their safety due to gangs torching houses and setting fires in the street.The issue of crime coupled with fly-tippers targeting the area has caused many people to move out of the area.  One man, who did not want to be named for safety reasons, told the ECHO: I feel unsafe. Thereaposs a gang - they donapost want to see this area getting better. All the time people are bringing their rubbish and they make fires. I canapost describe it to be honest with you, it looks like Beirut. Iaposm looking for a safe le, Iaposm not looking for trouble. Every day Iaposm going to work, I pay my bills. I remember one man moved in and he left after a couple of months because he wasnapost safe here. Theyaposre nice houses but for some reason, these people donapost want to see this area getting better. The problems with Primrose Court appear to have started when the development was first built by two private companies who went bust before work on site was completed. This means key elements such as street lighting and ‘proper kerbs’ have not been installed on the road. And because the road is unadopted, the duty to maintain it belongs to the owners of the properties.  In a previous interview with the ECHO, one woman who did not want to be named said she lived in a house on Primrose Court for seven years until she couldnapost take anymore. She said: It was nice when I first moved in. They were lovely houses. It went really bad around June . One family moved in and the next minute they all turned up. That was when it all went downhill. After the families moved out of the houses, which are privately owned, the woman said kids living in the area continued to vandalise them by smashing up windows. Speaking to the ECHO earlier this month, the owner of A Properties, Colin Bell, said of the  houses he manages across the region the  properties he owns on Primrose Court create % of our problems.  On average, Colin said he spends around one and a half to two days a week on the estate attending to issues and clearing up rubbish that has been left there. Colin said: All around Primrose Court there are nice properties going up and being sold immediately. The area is ripe for investment but weaposre stuck with Primrose Court simply because of the council really, I donapost know how many times Iaposve rung up asking whataposs happening or sent emails. They come back with the same thing apostheyaposre hoping to get funding.apos Of the  properties on Primrose Court, Colin said nine of the houses, which are owned by dferent landlords, are currently empty - and four of them are believed to have been derelict for over  years.Colin claims that in October , Knowsley Council promised street lighting would be installed and work on the road would be completed on the grounds that each property owner would pay towards the work. He said: Itaposs a crazy situation. Over two years ago now we agreed for the council to do the work and we would repay the council. For any of the houses that we didnapost repay, the council would repossess the houses and they would have charge of them. We were told the work would be completed in nine months - this was pre-covid. Up to now, weaposre still no further on. However, Knowsley Council has disputed these claims and said the properties on Primrose Court are all privately owned and the council never agreed to repossess them. A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “Knowsley Council did not build the properties at Primrose Court and has never owned them. It is therefore not the case that we are able to aposrepossessapos them and we have never agreed to do so. “In fact, many of the issues at Primrose Court arise because the development was built by two separate privately-owned companies – both of which went into liquidation without completing the work on-site and without meeting the planning conditions for the developments.  This meant that the usual processes for adopting the highway, installing street lighting etc could not be followed and the same problem prevents the installation of other measures such as CCTV. The current property owners expect the Council to use a considerable amount of public money to complete a privately owned development. “The Council has been in regular dialogue with the homeowners and landlords of properties in Primrose Court since the initial issues arose in the area. The council continued: A number of Council services, including Housing, Highways, Environmental Health, and Crime  Communities, have worked with homeowners and landlords to identy solutions to the issues on site, try to identy sources of funding, and agree a collaborative approach to tackling the issues that are evident. “For example, the Council met with some of the owners to discuss co-funding highways and infrastructure improvements to bring the road up to adoptable standards. At that meeting, the owners who attended agreed - in principle - to co-fund this work. Unfortunately some of the other owners who did not attend refused to agree to contribute their shares, which would be required to progress the adoption of the road under a Private Streetworks Agreement. The Council has established how much the work would cost should an agreement ever be reached, but these costs are only going to continue to increase as time passes due to the poor original construction of the road by the developers. “Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position itself to fund all of the work which is required on site. Indeed, this would not be appropriate given that the Council does not own any housing and is not able to re-possess privately-owned properties. “Despite this challenge, the Council continues to look at solutions to tackle the issues being experienced and we are bidding for additional funding to carry out work in the area. Only last year, we pledged an extra £ million of funds specically to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour across the Borough – which is a key issue here. “The standards at Primrose Court are not acceptable and we remain committed to working with the owners on collaborative solutions to resolve the issues for all concerned.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GoogleKing of the KippaxCCTVViralCCTV footageCrimeGoogle Street View\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Iaposm not sure there are enough words to say how grateful everyone is for what you have done. He said he had a particular affinity with staff because of his time as an air ambulance pilot. Lisa Kay, intensive home support service clinical lead, said: That was great to hear because itaposs not every day you get a royal visit to say thank you.  It has been a huge morale boost. Patient Bill Taylor, , was asked by the royals about the care he had received at the hospital and joked: Theyaposre trying their best but thereaposs some awkward b*****s. The retired policeman praised the hospital food, telling the couple he had a grand meat and potato pie for his lunch. He said: We all enjoy ourselves up here. But weaposd like you to come up more often.  He pointed out Pendle Hill, seen from the window of his ward, and told them: The kids would enjoy it.The Duke and Duchess, who are joint royal patrons of NHS Charities Together, heard how support from hospital charity ELHTMe had helped staff at the trust, which is in one of the areas of the country worst affected by Covid-.A grant of more than £, from NHS Charities Together, following the public response to its Covid- Urgent Appeal, allowed the charity to fund equipment and infrastructure for the staff wellbeing team, as well as the new therapy dog. Director of operations Catriona Logan said the duchess was really interested to know how the pandemic had been for staff. She said: We talked about how dficult it was for patients and families being separated by visiting restrictions. She was really engaging. Professor Eileen Fairhurst, trust chairwoman, added: It was really uplting for our staff a real morale boost that their work has been recognised by this high profile visit, and itaposs testament to the hard work and commitment of all our colleagues in the trust in the real challenges and dficulties we have faced since the pandemic. We have been hardest hit in this part of the country and it has really not gone away.

Last July, Harry was reportedly chased by a pack of photographers after he attended a charity event with sick children at Kew Gardens, west London.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The -year-old had flown back briefly from LA for the July  unveiling of the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial statue. The Sussexes have their own security in the US, but sources said the privately paid-for team have no authority whatsoever in the UK.And one royal source has now told Page Six : “If Harry goes, he will want to have security for him and his family. If and when he decides to go back to the UK, he needs security.” The couple have not announced any official travel plans for  as yet but it has been widely believed they would attend the service in memory of the Duke of Edinburgh who died last April at the age of . This would be the first time Lilbet would meet her paternal side of her family as Meghan has not ed to the UK since the couple officially quit royal le in March  and lost their taxpayer-funded police protection. The Mirror has contacted the Sussexes for a comment.  On Saturday, Harryaposs legal representatives said that he has filed a claim for judicial review because he wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. He has argued that his private protection team in the US does not have the necessary jurisdiction abroad, or access to UK intelligence that is needed to keep his family safe.In a statement to PA news agency, the legal representative for the Duke said: “The UK will always be Prince Harry ’s home and a country he wants his we and children to be safe in. “With the lack of police protection, comes too great a personal risk. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex personally fund a private security team for their family, yet that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection needed whilst in the UK. “In the absence of such protection, Prince Harry and his family are unable toto his home.” The legal representative added: “Prince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for le. He remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.  “While his role within the Institution has changed, his profile as a member of the Royal Family has not. Nor has the threat to him and his family.” The bid for a judicial review was filed in September. Dai Davies, former head of Scotland Yard’s royal protection unit, told the Mirror: If ever there was a proper credible threat to Prince Harry or his family then the Met would take the appropriate action. “If he or his family were toto Britain in an official capacity or to support the Queen during the Platinum Jubilee events I’m sure he would be afforded the necessary protection. “I would argue robustly against his case that he is not safe in the UK. If ever the British intelligence services did discover a threat to him and his family they are hardly going to sit on it. It appears that Harry is creating scenarios that do not exist.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The NHS hasnapost changed its official information yet about what the symptoms of the latest strain are, and so parents are continuing to get information out about the dferences between it and previous iants such as Delta, the Manchester Evening News reports. Using their Manchester Family Facebook page, the MEN has been asking parents to share how the virus has been affecting their youngsters.At the time of writing, the official NHS advice still reports a new and persistent cough, a loss of taste or smell and a fever as the main symptoms - but read on for how parents say the virus is dfering for their kids. What Omicron symptoms have parents seen in their kids   The first thing to note is how dferent the responses were between familiesapos experiences - while some kids had little to no symptoms, others were left quite unwell by the virus. The number of hospitalisations among infants has risen during the Omicron wave, although experts are still saying that the majority of cases are very mild and that people shouldnapost panic. Data published by the Scientic Advisory Group, or SAGE, on January  said that in previous waves approximately % of children hospitalised with Covid were under the age of one. Between mid-December  and January, this number rose to %. Despite this, they say severity is still low, with SAGE saying: For the small number of children who do attend hospital, theof stay is typically short and where they stay overnight it is often to allow for screening for other infections.The most common symptoms reported on the Facebook page were a cold, a temperature and a headache. More than  parents said their kids had suffered from a headache,  said there had been fever or temperature and  reported cold-like symptoms or a runny nose. Thirty-three parents also got in touch saying there had been tiredness or that their child hadnapost had any energy and was generally sleepy.A cough was reported in over two dozen cases, and while it was mild for some, others had a rougher time of it with a similar number identying a sore throat.Sickness and stomach ache also cropped up among the responses, as did a loss of appetite and taste . Achy backs and legs, as well as general muscle aches, were also flagged. Some kids also had diarrhoea or an upset stomach, pale skin, bloodshot eyes or sneezing.

Sources say the Duke was known for being rude and having childish obsessions - as he was ridiculed while on the road fulfilling royal duties, reports claim.It comes after reports the embattled Duke of York would allegedly scream and shoutBuckingham Palace servants failed to follow his exact plan for the arrangement of his teddy bears. Now more supposed demanding behaviour has come to light during his term as the UKaposs special representative for trade and investment. It includes suggestions he was privately mocked in the Gulf during his time as a special envoy.  A diplomat says the Prince became known as HBH - His Buffoon Highness. The former deputy head of mission in Bahrain, Simon Wilson, says the royalaposs travelling entourage left people speechless. He told The Times Andrew flew out a team which included his equerries and private secretaries. His valet would be equipped with a huge ironing board to ensure his clothes were perfectly pressed, it was claimed.  The diplomat, who had previously hosted the Duke, added that Andrew was rude and boorish and wasnapost well-liked. Mr Wilson explained he was known as a buffoon because of his childish obsession with doing the exact opposite of what had been agreed. He immediately warned that Andrewaposs private le would “willy-nilly, intrude into his public role” – and that he could be “going off with Ghislaine Maxwell to a nightclub” during his private time, it was claimed.Andrew has effectively been banished from the royal family less than  hours after learning a civil sex case against him in New York will go ahead.  The latest awkward anecdotes come after Tuesdayaposs claims that Andrew sketched out a plan for how his five teddies and cuddly toys should be positioned on his bed every night. Ex protection officer Paul Page tells ITV ’s Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile that would “scream and shout”his servants failed to place them exactly how he wanted. He supplied a handwritten guide is said to have included two hippos, a black panther and bears, as well as three cushions called aposDaddyapos, aposDucksapos and aposPrinceapos. It showed exactly where to place blankets, as well as five toys and a fur, which had ribbons that had to hang off the side of the bed, it is said. Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile host Ranvir Singh unravels the story of how Maxwell sank into shame and disgrace through her friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. And will also explore how Andrew became embroiled in the scandal as he faces his own possible civil court case brought by Virginia Giuffre.

Royal correspondent Jennie Bond has spoken of the Queenaposs apparent upset after a New York judge gave the green light for a civil sex abuse trial against her second son, Prince Andrew.Pending the trial, the Queen stripped him of all royal and military titles, leaving him in tears. The Duke of York has absolutely and categorically denied all allegations. Following his relegation, the Governmentaposs Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said Andrewaposs behaviour would have caused enormous challenges for the royal family. Meanwhile, Prince Harry threatened the Home Office with a judicial review should they refuse to provide him a security detail while visiting the UK. Ex-BBC royal correspondent Ms Bond believes the Queen will be feeling the strain and in despair over recent events involving more junior members of the Firm. Speaking to OK!, Ms Bond explained: I think The Queen will be holding her hands up in despair with her children and some of her grandchildren.She added there should be equity between Harry, who was stripped of titles when he renounced royal duties in , and Prince Andrew, who should have been demoted some time ago. She said: Everybody feels for the Queen now with the Andrew debacle, but I think there has to be some equity between Harry and Andrew now. There was the argument and it probably wasnapost correct, butHarry has been stripped of his titles then Andrew should have been some time ago.. Harry also made headlines this week as itaposs been reported that he could be planning to take legal action against the British governmenthe is denied police protection when he visits the UK.The Duke of Sussex issued a pre-protocol letter to the Home Office suggesting his lawyers will seek judicial reviewcontinued police security isn’t provided by the UK when he and his family are in the country. Harryaposs lawyers made it clear he is happy to pay for the added protection It comes after Harry made a series of visits to the UK over the past year, but claims his security situation lacked continuity ,changing from one visit to the next. While in the UK to attend his granddadaposs funeral in April, bodyguards were protecting him and his family. However, when he ed later that same year in July to witness the unveiling of a statue of his late mum, Princess Diana, he was without security. A safety concern was raised after a group of photographers chased his car as he left the charity event. A legal representative for Prince Harry said the legal claim was filed in September to challenge the decision-making behind the security procedures, in the hopes that this could be re-evaluated for the obvious and necessary protection required. According to Ms Bond, Prince Andrewaposs security should be revised too. She said: If Harry is not going to be allowed to have security over here unless heaposs staying in a royal residence then perhaps Andrewaposs security should be looked at too. On the other hand, the expert says Harry should look at the le he has chosen after moving to the US. She explains: There has to be some kind of equity between the two of them but Harry needs to look at himself, heaposs chosen this way of le, he wants to be regarded as a royal citizen, and he canapost pick and choose like this. Ms Bond added that Prince Harry canapost have it both ways. She explained: He canapost be treated as a royal with all of the trimmings while heaposs over here and then swan off back to the states and say that youaposre not. I donapost think the pennyaposs quite dropped yet.Harry moved to the US in  after he and we Meghan Markle decided to step back from senior royals, and they now raise their two children - Archie and Lilibet - in Calornia.Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenJennie BondPrince HarryPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harry might come over but it gives Meghan a good excuse not to come and also not to bring the children. Meanwhile, another royal expert previously claimed the Queen finds it dficult that she has been unable to see Harry and Meghan’s children.Speaking in the Channel  documentary : The Queen’s Terrible Year, royal expert Camilla Tominey says it has been hard for the Queen to be so far away from her two great-grandchildren. She said: Iaposm sure the Queen was absolutely delighted to hear the news that the Sussexes were expecting a second child. She continued: But it is dficult for the Queen. She has not been able to see Archie. I think the last time she was able to see Archie in the flesh was November . The only way the Queen will be able to see these children isthey come over to the UK. Maybe she will see them next year when she marks her Platinum Jubilee. We have to wait and see.

But rather than run it herself, a maid does it for her to make sure it is to her exact preference.The author explained in the Daily Mail : While Her Majesty is enjoying her first cup of tea, her maid will go into the adjoining bathroom to draw the bath, which has to be exactly the right temperature: tested with a wooden-cased thermometer, and no more than seven inches of water. While sheaposs enjoying her soak, her dresser Angela Kelly is then said to prepare the Queenaposs outfit and once sheaposs finished her bath Her Majesty then gets dressed and fixes her hair ready for breakfast at .am.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

But why is it the Queen would prefer a time-consuming bath to a quick shower  Well author Craig Brown, who wrote Ma’am Darling:  Glimpses of Princess Margaret, once offered an answer. He once told W Magazine: She [Margaret] always took a bath because she and other royals believe ‘showers are for people who are rushing out the door to get to work’.”However, itaposs not just the Queen who has specic demands when it comes to baths.  Former butler Paul Burrell, who worked closely with Princess Diana and her family in the s revealed Prince Charlesapos routine on the Amazon Primeaposs documentary Serving the Royals: Inside the Firm.He told the documentary: The water temperature has to be just tepid, and only half full.” The ex-butler also added that the bath plug must face a specic direction, his bath towel must be arranged to his taste and his underwear can’t be a crease out of place.

The question I ask now is, how am I going to feed my baby   We’ve had to go out and get normal milk which we know makes her sick and it’s not enriched enough so sheaposs going to lose weight. I don’t know what we are supposed to do. Shannon says her formula first ran out on December  and sheaposs been struggling to find any since. The new mum said: I was told Fiadh had stopped growing two weeks prior to her birth because of a growth issue so a doctoraposs performed a Caesarean.  She was taken into the NICU for five weeks where I used breast milk in a bottle for eight weeks to give her the best fighting chance. But her weight dropped and she needed extra calories because my milk wasn’t enough for her growing appetite. I took the very hard decision to try and transition her into the formula with Cow and Gate Nutriprem  recommended. She loved it but we last ran out on December  and havenapost been able to order any since. Shannon has resorted to using a dferent formula, which she says has had a detrimental impact on Fiadhaposs development. She said: We were doing well until Fiadh took a turn for the worst on December  when she began to be sick from the new formula.  She was taking a little amount of milk and then bringing it back up so she was really hungry and upset. I was getting worried about her so I rang  and they told me to be seen by someone immediately. A doctor admitted us straight away and said Fiadh was going to need to be treated for dehydration. Shannon said: She only weighs five pounds and six ounces to this day and is below her centile - a growth chart indicating where a guideline baby should be at their age. Iaposve been told how important the Cow  Gate formula is but I canapost buy it anywhere. Iaposve been to chemists and pharmacies in Hull, Scunthorpe, Immingham and Grimsby to be told itaposs out of stock. Iaposve tried contacting Cow  Gate to find thereaposs a national shortage of this product. It feels like I’ve been passed from pillar to post without any joy.

All frontline workers in England face the sackthey have not had two Covid vaccines by April , meaning they must get their first dose by February . The unvaccinated nurse, of London, told of her outrage at the mandate and called it an infringement of her human rights. How can you force me to put something in my body andI disagree then Iaposm out of a job and potentially lose my home  she told My London.I donapost know how Iaposm going to pay my mortgage, I donapost know how Iaposm going to pay my bills but itaposs a risk Iaposm willing to take for my human rights.  The nurse is based in the east London borough of Newham where  per cent of residents are yet to receive their first dose. She claims she was handed a letter from her employer stating that her team must be vaccinated by the end of March or leave their jobs. But the message has proven fruitless in persuading her to change her mind. As a healthcare professional I should be given the opportunity to make an informed decision about things affecting my body, she said. I hope someone somewhere will have common sense and bring about some sort of change. I thinkwe accept this then it opens a dangerous door to other things that the Government or other corporations can impose on our livelihoods. The nurse, who is of African descent, believes that vaccine hesitancy is strong in black and ethnic minority communities, and suggested reasons for this could be fear, hidden agendas and issues of mistrust.  Recent figures show that the  most unvaccinated areas in the UK are all in London. Almost one third of Londoners still have not received their first dose of the vaccine, according to Government data. Most of Londonaposs boroughs are lagging far behind other parts of the UK, with Westminster ranking worst overall for first dose uptake at just . per cent. By stark contrast, the five areas with the highest first dose vaccination rates in the UK are all in Scotland according to figures from January . Argyll and Bute is the most vaccinated upper tier local authority in the UK where . per cent of residents have had the first jab. Dr Raheelah Ahmad, director for global engagement at City, University of London, has studied vaccine uptake in England.We found that Asian and Black people are, respectively, twice and . times less likely to accept the Covid- vaccine than White British people, she said.The expert also highlighted the importance of analysing ethnic minority inclusion in the fight against vaccine hesitancy. Population characteristics can be used to infer vulnerability of certain communities to Covid, or to the likelihood of high levels of vaccine hesitancy, she added. Communities harder hit by the virus, or at risk of being so, stand to benefit from greater resource allocation than their population size alone would suggest. This could partly explain why the total number of people living in Newham who have received a first dose stands at almost  per cent lower than top-of-the-table Bromley. Bromley is the most vaccinated borough in London, with . per cent of residents receiving the first dose. Just  per cent of Bromleyaposs population consists of black and ethnic minority communities, while these same communities make up over  per cent of Newham, according to an ONS population census in . The London borough of Kensington and Cha is the second most unvaccinated UTLA in the UK where just . per cent of residents have had the first dose. Professor Azeem Majeed, chair in primary care and public health at Imperial College London, suggested that low vaccination rates among Londoners could also be driven by a mobile population. He said: With many living in the capital shorter term, for work or study, it can be dficult to send vaccine appointments because of inaccurate address information. For example, some Londoners will have had their vaccines overseas and won’t show up in official statistics. He added: “We need to continue to encourage people living in London and across the UK to get vaccinated and reduce their risk of catching COVID- and having a more serious illness.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSUniversity of LondonImperial CollegeHuman rightsCoronavirus vaccineCoronavirusHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some people will still be wary about ing to workPlan B guidance is coming to and end and some has already been scrapped Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchSEO Writer:,  Jan | comments Rules for working from home have changed once again.Boris Johnsonaposs government announced the plan after its review into the Plan B restrictions in place since December, designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.The government hopes that the UK is now past the peak of the Omicron iant, although the number of confirmed cases have gone back up again since an apparent downward trend at the beginning of this week.Reported cases on January  had fallen to ,, the lowest since December. However, over , cases were reported on January . This is still nowhere near the beginning of January, when cases were well over the , mark, but is not an encouraging sign as the government lts restrictions. Plan B brought in restrictions like working from home, so can we now go back into the office  Do we still have to work from home   Work-from-home guidance ended with immediate effect, the Prime Minister announced in a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, January . This means that people are now able to go back into the office when previously they were discouraged from doing so since Plan B was put in place on December .  The PM said: From now on, the government are no longer asking people to work from home. People should now speak to their employer about arrangements for ing to the office.Leader of the Labour PartyKeir Starmer said in response that the opposition approved the plans as long as they were based on evidence.He said the PM must reassure the public he is acting to protect their health, not just his job. Can your company force you to go back to the office   If your company requires you to come into the office, they can only make youyour contract stipulates working in an office. Citizens Advice said: You can ask to keep working from home, but that doesnapost mean your employer has to agree. Start by having an open conversation with your employer about your wishes, and consider making a flexible working request. However, employers are also duty-bound to make the work environment as safe as possible, so they should consider minimising visitors and improving ventilation, as well as considering the use of one-way systems and extra cleaning. The Trade Union Commission, meanwhile, had firmer advice people may want to considerthey do not feel safe at work.It said: If your boss is asking you toto the workplace or stay at home and you don’t feel comfortable, you should speak to other members and your union rep immediately - they may feel the same about the situation. If you raise the issue collectively with your employer, they’re much more likely to listen. What  has changed   Plan B restrictions were originally due to expire on January . As well as the work-from-home guidance, the PM announced that face coverings would no longer be required in school classrooms from January . An unnamed director of public health at a city in the north of England said they have some concerns about the change of rules in classrooms.They told: This feels like more of a political decision than a decision based on the evidence and the science, and it could be quite London-centric.I worry the decision has not been made for the right reasons. From January , face coverings in indoor public places will no longer be required and venues and events will no longer be required by law to use NHS Covid passes.Venues can choose to impose the use of passesthey choose to do so.Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: Today marks the start of the next chapter in this country’s fight against [Covid].But it’s not the end of the road and we shouldn’t see this as the finish line.

Kasey Clarke, , traded in her job as a producer to start her own firm.Kasey had worked at the BBC for  years before leaving in  to pursue baking full-time, MyLondon reports. She now runs her own successful business, Sweet Cakey Thing, which she launched in March  after spending years developing her craft and finding her niche - as well as driving for Uber in Central London on the side.These ventures combined make her up to £, a year, and she credits the flexibility of Uber for facilitating her success. In  I went full-time into baking, and financially I wasnapost  per cent prepared for that, Kasey said. I was able to keep myself going for a couple of years before I had to find another source of income to support me.I tried other avenues, working as a warehouse operative for John Lewis, as a pollster during the Brexit campaign, teaching cake decorating skills... but all of these things had the problem of being very fixed, in terms of time, in terms of income.I found juggling those very rigid timetables around impromptu cake orders very hard - I wanted to find something that was flexible to my primary needs of building my business. There are plenty of problems with the gig economy, but one thing that can be said for the likes of Uber is its flexibility. You can work when you want, where you want, and that prospect was very appealing to Kasey. I was doing the midnight sht at John Lewis, schlepping mattresses from one end of the warehouse to the other, and I kept hearing this advert for Uber. I was like: aposYou know what, I love driving, Iaposve never considered being a taxi driver before, and these guys seem to have made it really easy for me to do that. Let me look into itapos, she said. Kasey signed up for Uber, which enabled her to get her finances under control, sort out her credit score, and to be able to take on the sorts of baking jobs she really wanted to do.  Rather than keeping on churning out kidsapos birthday cakes, Kasey could start working on the beautul wedding cakes sheaposd always dreamed of, and then she started developing Sweet Cakey Thing. Sweet Cakey Thing is an award-winning naughty, natural, outrageous indulgence,  per cent aposfree fromapos cake in a jar, Kasey explains. Itaposs perfect for paleo, gluten intolerance, coeliacs, yogis, gym bunnies, and people who just want to enjoy a clean diet with absolutely no crap in there at all, just  per cent natural whole foods. Kasey spent the time leading up to the first Covid lockdown in her kitchen developing recipes, launching the brand at a yoga studio pop-up in March . Shortly afterwards, the country went into lockdown and Sweet Cakey Thing had to go entirely online. Kasey continued driving for Uber, which she says requires a great deal of management and responsibility in order to balance her business and her side hustle, but her earnings show how well it can pay off.  I start my day in Hertfordshire, where I am now, and I just go where the rides take me, she said. Iniably they take me into London, I find myself there almost every day. I tend to work less to an area and more to the clock: I clock in at six, with a view to doing six hours and be done by  so I can get back and focus on other things, getting to the kitchen or whatever needs to be done, she continued. Wherever I find myself around  oaposclock is where Iaposm looking to start making my way back towards home. Iaposm near Stansted Airport, but I find myself in East London, or South London, or West London, Central London pretty quickly. All roads lead to London, she laughed. Despite how much she loves driving for Uber, meeting new people every day and seeing every corner of London, Kasey hopes that  will be the year she can take Sweet Cakey Thing full time. Iaposm looking forward to building on where Iaposve got to in the past six months, expanding the range with new flavours, and Iaposm hoping to do a pop-up tour in the summer, she said. All of that means Iaposll be needing to spend more time with Sweet Cakey Thing and less time on the road. My TfL licence expires this August, and my agenda is to not need to review it, so come August Iaposll be a full-time entrepreneur, working on my cake business. Come August, itaposll just be aposthank you very muchapos to Uber for having gotten me to this point, for supporting me in building my dream. Dreams like Kaseyaposs are made by people shopping small and supporting local independent business, which is something many Londoners have been doing a lot more of throughout Covid. She hopes the sentiment continues as the world continues to open up again, and that people continue to shop small, and shop often.

The incredible scenes were snapped at one of the fast-food chainaposs restaurants in Borehamwood, Herts.Normally, drivers in cars are seen ordering grub from the drive-thru, but many were understandably left baffled when a woman and her steed joined the line of vehicles waiting.When she got to the window, she dismounted and told the employee what she wanted, Bristol Livereports. Her horseaposs snout was then seen hilariously poking its snout curiously into the window - probably trying to inspect the aromas of McDonaldaposs food. The woman was then seen trotting on with a coffee in one hand as she chatted away on her mobile phone. It is unclear whether she ordered any food for her steed or decided to keep their diet to carrots and hay. Incredibly, it is not the first time McDonaldaposs customers have seen someone ordering from the drive-thru on horseback.In December, dad-of-three Simon White saw the hilarious event unfold while stopping to eat at his local McDonaldaposs in Caerphilly, Wales. The woman stood in the queue, paid at the first window and then collected her meal at the second while Simon,  took some photos of the bizarre incident. His pictures show the woman in a mustard puffer jacket and riding boots sitting on a white horse and joining the line as though nothing is out of the ordinary. She holds her purse in her hand, ready to pay for her snack, and then pays for her food while perched on her horse. The horse appeared to not be phased and waited for her to finish patiently, and the two rode off after the staff members give her her meal.

Side effects such as thrombosis caused alarm and women to reject it. Then scares about breast cancer further eroded their confidence. Emanating from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study , concerns about the risk of dementia with HRT has grown.The first study showed dementia doubled in women aged  years and older after taking a particular form of combined HRTfor an average of four years.However, a later report from that study found no increased risk of dementia with equine oestrogens alone, whereas pooled results of both formulations showed a % increased risk. WHIMS had been the only large-scale trial of HRT for the prevention of dementia. Trials of HRT and cognitiveamong women in early menopause showed neutral results. According to Yana Vinogradova of Nottingham University, and colleagues from Chicago and Boston, key questions remain. Does oestrogen have greater cognitive safety than oestrogen and progestogen combined  Does timing or duration of use, or both, matter  Can the WHIMS findings apply to women in early menopause or to those using other hormone products A new large studyattempts to answer those questions. An important, surprising finding is the risk of dementia doesn’t depend on oestrogen but on progesterone. Oestrogen alone conferred a % decreased odds of dementia among women younger than  who were treated for at least  years, with a % decrease in risk for each year of treatment. Conversely, when oestrogen and progestogen were combined there was an % increased risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia among women who had used hormone therapy for five to nine years. And there was a % increased risk among women treated for  years or more. When , women treated with conjugated equine oestrogens alone were followed for  years they ended up with a % decreased risk of death from Alzheimer’s and dementia.Crucially, this risk wasn’t altered when conjugated oestrogens were combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Of all the combinations, oestrogen-dydrogesterone used for one to  years, carried the lowest risk. This combo is special – in earlier studies, it had the lowest risk for breast cancer and thrombosis.These findings don’t mean HRT should be used to prevent dementia. But for anyone taking HRT it puts dementia into context. No increase in risk was found with oestrogen alone, and, for oestrogen plus progesterone, the increased risk was five to seven extra cases per , woman years.

The -year-old already on articial le support was a registered organ donor and his family had agreed to the pioneering op on his behalf. Surgeons say within a decade other pig organs such as hearts, lung and livers could be given to humans needing transplants.  Senior author Dr Jayme Locke, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said: “This game-changing moment in the history of medicine represents a paradigm sht and a major milestone in the field of xenotransplantation, which is arguably the best solution. “We have bridged critical knowledge gaps and obtained the safety and feasibility data necessary to begin a clinical trial in living humans with end-stage kidney failure disease.” It comes weeks after the first pig heart was transplanted into a living US patient and three months after the first single kidney was transplanted in to another brain dead patient.  In this latest op ten key genes that would have led to the kidneys being rejected were knocked out in the genetically modied donor pig. Mr Parsons’ ex-we Julie O’Hara, and their children, Ally, David and Cole, made the decision, along with his sisters and mother.  Ms O’Hara said: “Jim was a never-met-a-stranger kind of guy who would talk to anyone and had no enemies - none. “Jim would have wanted to save as many people as he could with his death, andhe knew he could potentially save thousands and thousands of people by doing this, he would have had no hesitation. “Our dream is that no other person dies waiting for a kidney, and we know that Jim is very proud that his death could potentially bring so much hope to others.” Kidney disease kills more people each year than breast or prostate cancer and pig organs could soon be given to patients suffering end-stage kidney failure.  Mr Parsons’ family gave permission for the four hour procedure to go ahead at the university’s Legacy of Hope Donor Recovery Centre. The kidneys filtered blood, produced urine and, importantly, were not immediately rejected. They remained viable until the study was ended,  hours after transplant. Mr Parsons was a registered organ donor. He had longed to have his organs help others upon his death - but they were not suitable. So he was maintained on a ventilator to keep his body ing. His native kidneys were removed, and replaced with the pig’s. Dr Locke said: “Mr Parsons and his family allowed us to replicate precisely how we would perform this transplant in a living human. “Their powerful contribution will save thousands of lives, and that could begin in the very near future. “Mr Parsons’ gt honours his legacy and firmly establishes the viability, safety and feasibility of this preclinical model. Because of his gt, we have proposed this to be known as ‘The Parsons Model.’” The Food and Drug Administration in the US has approved the use of genetic modication of pigs for this type of research. However rules in the UK are much stricter and would currently prohibit such work. It involves the setting up of specialist facilities where pigs can be bred genetically modied to tweak, silence and add key genes that would reject key organs such as the heart and kidney. The results pave the way for a Phase  clinical trial at Alabama for patients with end-stage kidney failure. Dr Locke added: “A radical solution is needed for the organ supply crisis. The domestic pig is a promising organ source.” Pig heart valves are already widely used in humans. The natural lespan of a pig is  years, they are easily bred and have organs of similar size. Genetically modied pig kidneys have been extensively tested in non-human primates. The Mirror has campaigned for six years to increase organ donation and successfully lobbied the Government to introduce a “deemed consent” system in England in .The NHS Blood and Transplant says matching more human donors remains the priority for now.A spokesperson said: “There is still some way to go before transplants of this kind become an everyday reality. “While researchers and clinicians continue to do our best to improve the chances for transplant patients, we still need everyone to make their organ donation decision and let their family know what they want to happenorgan donation becomes a possibility.” The findings are reported in the American Journal of Transplantation.

Meredith, who works as a hairdresser and fitness coach, went from a dress size of  to a dress size of six in the space of two years. Meredith, from Texas, US, said: My whole le I was overweight and no matter what fad diet I tried, I would lost a little bit and then after a few months I would give up and gain it all back plus extra.When I was , I was faced with serious health issues and was concerned about my overall health and future given my weight so everyday, I was suffering from headaches, rashes, nausea, and doctors could never find a problem besides a thyroid condition.One day, I realised my health had reached this low point because of my weight and thataposs when I made the decision to start my weight loss journey. After getting engaged, the wedding motivated me to lose weight because when I was dress shopping, I had trouble fitting in dresses or doing the zip up at several stores. It was really discouraging but by my wedding day, I felt beautul and although I wasnapost at my goal weight, I was so proud of what I had accomplished. My husband has supported me so much on this journey and heaposs always encouraged me to stay on track. Meredith first started losing weight by joining a gym in August  and changing her eating habits. The fitness fanatic went from weighing st lb to st lb in just two years and is now helping others do the same. She added: In a little over two years, I lost all of that weight whilst gaining muscle mass from simply counting my macros and eating in the correct calorie deficit along with weight training six days a week. My sizes changed completely I went from a XL to a small in clothes and my bra size went from a DDD to a B. I started posting on social media when I first started losing weight and the support I was getting from others was amazing so I pushed even harder and shared more to show others that it could be done.  I then started giving others advice at that point and then found a true passion in helping others. My husband cooks for us daily and at the beginning of my journey, he worked away from home so he would spend his days teaching me everything nutrition wise so I was able to cook the right food for myself when he was away. I am still in the process of transforming my body and am still currently in a calorie deficit as of now. Although I am way pass my goal, my plan is to stay in a deficit for a little bit longer to target certain stubborn areas and then in a few months I will be doing a small bulk to strictly gain muscle mass.

Image: RedditByLayla NicholsonEmma RosemurgeyAudience Writer:,  Jan | comments If you were ever in any doubt over just how immature British humour is, then look no further than this thread of Brits left in fits of giggles over a rather rude looking window. Youaposve got to admit, it is pretty funny.Swaths of Brits have been left in stitches after someone on Reddit highlighted an unusual window design, which,youaposve got a rather cheeky mind, looks an awful lot like the shape of a penis.According to the Daily Star, the window appears on a lodge overlooking a cemetery in Banbury, Oxfordshire, and many people have been left gobsmacked at its phallic-like appearance. Told you, immature humour. Anyway, the body of the window is impressive inand consists of four panes – with the top piece of glass moulded into a rounded tip. The design also boasts a girthy exterior with a circular window on each side. Reddit users have been left in stitches at the phallic windows, and so took to the comments to poke fun at the construction.I see nothing wrong here, seems like a perfectly normal wangdow to me, one joked, while another added: Every time we drove past this to visit my grandma I would giggle at this. A third commented: The builders must have had fun when they erected it… We see what you did there. Ahaha the glorious d*** window that sits right by a cemetery...classic, a fourth wrote, while another said: I hope Iaposm not the only one who can see the two windows below look like a pair of legs, parted and waiting…Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The actor, presenter, comedian, author, and DJ is truly a Jack of all trades and now heaposs fronting a Sky History show that examines famous sightings, called UFO : Conspiracies.Craig, , said that UFOs can come in aposall dferent shapes and sizesapos, and heaposs opened up about his own spooky sighting. He said he isnapost sure what was behind the phenomenon, but on the documentary he examines evidence alongside expert astrophysicist and award-winning author Sarah Cruddas to try to get to the bottom of it.  What do you think about UFOs  Let us know in the comments...Craig became a national favourite when he starred as David Lister in hit comedy Red Dwarf, where he was, mostly, the last human alive, floating through space and encountering aliens. Craig said that his interest in UFOs, also known as Unidentied Aerial Phenomenabegan in those early days, but he was afraid to admit it. Speaking to Sky History, he said: Back in the day you would never say so because people would think you were a bit of a crank. Now, the Americans have released all this footage that clearly shows these UFOs, and UAPs are there. Iaposm not saying theyaposre not aliens but they do exist. What are they   Do the Russians and Chinese have technology that is so much more advanced from our own  That is as frightening as aliens to be sure. How can craft travel , mph then stop instantly  The G-Force alone from that would turn a human being into mush  Are they drones, or are they robots  Some of them fly and then go underwater. We have footage of that from fighter jets and aircraft carriers. What are they  Me and my friend were in Galway once, sat in his garden and these weird things flew over. The next day, there was like, lots of stuff on the news about it. People had been phoning in to report seeing alien craft flying over the skies of Galway. Me and my mate saw that but I donapost know what it was   Working alongside Sarah on the TV show, Craig is examining famous sightings and they look at a sleepy Welsh village thataposs the scene of a major sighting, evidence collected from a aposcrash siteapos, and rumours of a military cover up. Craig said: The Rendlesham Forest case is really interesting because it was the American military who reported seeing all these weird lights in the woods. These are highly trained officers who arenapost going to mistake a car headlight for a spaceship. You do wonder what they actually saw there. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. A lot of the footage thataposs just been released by the American Air Force is very compelling. You can see these things on film and theyaposre all dferent shapes. A lot of people report seeing this pyramid-shaped craft. It doesnapost have an engine and itaposs just thrusting forward and flying through the air. This pyramid shape comes up quite a lot, from many dferent sightings. Thereaposs a lot of dferent kind of craft that people have claimed to see: barrel-shaped, disc-shaped and boomerang-shaped craft.  Unfortunately, with this series, hard evidence is really thin on the ground and thataposs one thing I found a bit frustrating. Although all of the stories are told with conviction and are certainly very believable He added: I now know that these things exist. Theyaposre not a figment of anyoneaposs imagination. Even the American government admits that now. Itaposs proved to me that Iaposm not a Fraggle. Unexplained Aerial Phenomena are out there, we just donapost know what they are. Sarah Cruddas added: “We are living in an incredible time for space exploration, but we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what is out there. Marrying together Craig’s passion and enthusiasm with my own thirst for evidence and an application of science, we have been able to explore what is going on in our skies like never before. Some of the answers are likely to be stranger than anything you could ever imagine.” Craig Charles: UFO Conspiracies aired on January  on Sky History.

Georgia Pontin from Kettering in Northamptonshire first started working for the clothing giant on the weekends after college, back in July .During her time there she learnt a thing or two about the running of the store and a number of insider secrets, which she now shares on her TikTok @pontasaurus .Georgia first went viral on the app after she posted a video revealing what it was like working there and the best ways to shop in the store as a customer. Since then she has posted  more videos on the subject, growing her a following of more than , fans. So, we have compiled some of her best store secrets, so you can get the most bang for your buck. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Why the clothes are so cheap Primark is loved for its bargains, but apparently, thereaposs a reason why the clothes are so cheap. Georgia explained that the store doesnapost play any music to keep costs down. By not playing music they donapost have to pay any licensing fees which helps keep the cost down, and to be fair Primark is loud enough as it is so you wouldnapost even hear the music, she said. Where to find hidden stock Georgia explained how both staff and shoppers would hide their favourite pieces in strange locations around the store when new releases arrived, as these items quickly run out of popular sizes. However, most customers forget they put these items away – so itaposs always worth a look whereyouaposre struggling to find a size. The ex-employee recommends starting with corners of the shop and lower racks, especially in the nightwear section. All the popular stuff goes very quickly, she said. The most popular sizes, which are ,  and  will go and once theyaposre gone, theyaposre gone. But sometimes people are undecided about a piece of clothing and will hide it in case they want to come back and get it. They almost always forget about it but sometimesyou check right at the back of the rails that are still quite full, some people hide stuff there. And in corners of the store. Since a lot of people glance over areas that are in front of them, the corners of the store are sometimes the most forgotten about. There was one particular corner in the pyjama section, on the lowest rack, where people would hide stuff. When I used to work and I saw something I want to buy on my break, I would put it in that corner too and come and collect it when I was on my break. Donapost worry, Iaposm pretty sure my managers knew I did that. It was so hard to not spend all your money in there since we worked around the clothes all the time and saw the items as they first hit the shelves. What to doyour size isnapost in stock Itaposs so annoying when you find something you like but you canapost find it in your size. While many of us might just accept that itaposs not meant to be, there is something  you can do. Georgia said: If you find something you really like but they donapost have your size in stock at one store, then you can ask one of the members of staff to call another store and seethey have it. Obviously you would have to go and pick it up, they wonapost deliver it to the store but itaposs something to think about. Now thereaposs no guarantee that a staff member is going to do it for you, but itaposs always best to checkyou really want this product. Why you should wash the clothes before you wear them This one isnapost so much of a secret Georgia says, but an important reminder. When you buy your clothes and you take them home, please wash them the first time you wear them. Like every other retail store,someoneaposs ing something or theyaposve tried something on in the fitting room, it doesnapost get washed after theyaposve tried it on. You have no clue what that other person has been doing, what theyaposve been wearing, where theyaposve put their clothes - so please wash the clothes. Sometimes when I used to work there, weaposd get clothes back and weaposd check them over and they had stains on them and only then we can determine whether we sell it or not. If we choose not to sell it then it would go to the faulty bit butwe do sell it, then itaposll be a reduced price - so thataposs the risk that you have to take. What the bells mean If you ever hear three rings on the bell, be careful – it signals that there is some form of emergency going on. Georgia said: The bells ringing in Primark have dferent meanings. One ring is to alert the floor staff that help is needed on the tills, two rings are to alert supervisors and site managers, and three rings is to signal for an emergency. Despite some unfortunate experiences with unhappy customers, Georgia thoroughly enjoyed working at Primark. She added: I loved working at Primark. My first job as a waitress was awful and put me off working in food forever. When I heard a Primark was opening up at the new shopping complex, I jumped at the chance. Since I started from the beginning, everyone was in the same boat and we all saw what the store looked like without any clothes or stock in. They brought in staff from all over the country to help us set up so we knew what we were doing. How to get first dibs on clothes in a new store If you have a new Primark store opening up in your area, this is how to get first dibs on the clothes in there, Georgia says. So I started working at my store when it first ever opened and we had a staff only night just before it opened. You got to see it brand new, you got to see all the new stock, you got first dibs on the popular items and all the popular sizes... At the event, you can bring friends and family so they can see everything too and they can buy stuff first as well. Soyou have a new store opening up and you know someone thataposs gonna work there then thataposs how to get first dibs on all the items in the shop. When to avoid shopping Georgia explained that each store has a prime time which is their busiest hour. So at the store I worked at, our prime time was pm and during that time, anyone who wasnapost on break or lunch had to be downstairs on the shop floor. Because it got so busy we had to go behind everyone and fold everything, put things back and make sure it was all neat, or at least weaposd try to.

After forking out £ a month for a houseshare in central London, he decided to see what other options there were to avoid extortionate rents.But with London property prices even higher - he decided to use his savings to buy a -year-old Dutch narrowboat for £, in September .He then spent over a year doing renovations for an extra £, including labour costs, and now lives on the water in Cookham, Berks.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Along with his girlfriend, Ellie Williams, , he pays a £ mooring fee a month, along with a boating licence and insurance for roughly an additional £ per month. The average selling price of a flat within central London is well over £ million, meaning the couple has saved a huge fortune by investing in a home on the water.Lloyd said: “Renting in London was just ridiculous, I was paying £ a month for a room in a house share, and wouldnapost know where to begin with the price to buy outright.It made more sense for me to buy a barge to live on. Mooring at Cookham costs £ monthly, plus a boating licence and insurance for roughly an additional £ per month.“After that, the only other major running cost is coal for the stove, big bags are less than £ which usually lasts a few weeks.It isnapost just utility bills Lloyd saves on, but the renovation too.Lloyd managed to save on some labour costs by doing a lot of the work himself with the support of friends and family.He adds: “I had a welder install an extension on the stern and bow to give us more space, as well as creating that open plan effect.“I stripped the entire boat back to the metal frame, I was a bit hesitant at first, but with it being such an old boat, I wanted to make sure it was completely rust and rot free.“I had all the windows replaced with double glazing and installed a skylight for £ as well as painting the inside of the boat white to make the boat look airy and bright.“All of the frames and walls I constructed myself, as well as the bed but had to do a lot of shuffling around when I got the  litre water tank installed.“There were plenty of ups and downs during the renovations, and I definitely learned several new skills.“All the hard work has definitely paid off, I love the freedom that boat le gives you.”Despite the high cost of renovations, the couple have managed to snag a few bargains and freebies along the way.Ellie, an accountant from Derbyshire, said: “We bought a fridge on Facebook Marketplace for £, which fits everything we need and is certainly an upgrade from Lloyd’s original wine fridge. We also got some spare mattresses from friends that we turned into cushions with plenty of comfy filling.“We have a charity shop coffee table for working from home, but we’re hoping to build a proper workstation from scratch soon.“We both really love plants, so have filled the boat up with them, creating plant pots with old painted food tins.“Lloyd’s mum also gted us some lovely small painted decorative pieces.Lloyd added: “With the plants, skylight and open plan space, it really feels like we’re living outside. How do you save money  Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirrorAfter living in ‘Julia’ for just under a year, the couple has had to make a series of compromises due to their minimalist living.Lloyd said: “It was definitely hard making the transition from living in a house share to living on a boat.“We’re completely reliant on solar power, so try and keep the fridge off with fewer daylight hours during winter, because they don’t charge up so quickly. We put things in a cool box instead.“Shower time also has to be limited as we’re not plugged into a water supply and we try not to use the washing machine on board.Ellie added: “I rent a flat in London for the time-being, so we pop in there every so often with all our laundry. “We’ll definitely miss that luxurywe both commit to living on the barge full-time.“I really miss having long showers, and they usually have to be less than two minutes so Lloyd will jokingly put a little egg timer on whilst I’m in there.Despite the compromises the pair have had to make, they have both fallen in love with river living and are looking forward to travelling around come summer, before eventually selling up.Lloyd said: “It’s incredible waking up on the river every morning and embracing the sounds of nature as well as viewing the sunrises.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON House pricesproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

American blogger and mum, Alexis often shares videos of her travels, useful tips and destination recommendations on TikTok, where sheaposs known as @worldtraveladventurers. But in a recent video, that has been viewed more than , times, she sparked a debate about travel etiquette as she asked what the right age is for kids to be allowed in upper classes on planes.

So when Tymarahaposs arm is scanned with a phone, All-Star - which die-hard fans will recall plays out as we get to know Shrek and his grouchy bachelor lestyle in the opening credits - will play out on Spoty.Thankfully, it works perfectly. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Tymarah from Greenhithe, Kent said: I thought it was so funny and it actually worked! I just think the song and film is hilarious.Personally, I donapost think Iaposll regret it. I have quite a lot of tattoos and itaposs just a few lines on the back of my arm. Iaposve seen far worse tattoos on people! Shrek-mad Tymarah first saw the comedy adventure at the cinema as a child and declares she has been obsessed ever since, much to her friendsapos amusement. The eyelash technician explained: Itaposs kind of like an ongoing joke between me and my friends that I like Shrek. I think we spoke about getting a Shrek tattoo once and whenever we are on a long drive I just play the song. I thought this would be better than a Shrek tattoo as it means something to me and my friends, not just a random Shrek tattoo! Tymarah had the unusual tat done at Sacred Empire Tattoo  Piercing in Tonbridge on Friday, January th. Sheaposd initially booked in to have a Japanese dragon inked on her forearm, however, before getting out of the chair, she askedthe artist could also throw add the small Spoty Code tattoo on her upper arm.  Although it took a four-hour session to complete her dragon tattoo, it took just ten minutes for the artist, who is also a friend of Tymarah, to add the usable code. The artist made a stencil using a code Tymarah herself had screenshotted from her Spoty app. According to Tymarah: She knows Iaposm crazy so she didnapost even blink an eyelid! If they change the software and it doesnapost work I wouldnapost care, itaposs a personal tattoo on my body and means something to me. I have other amazing art pieces tattooed on me and they donapost have any meaning, soanything Iaposm more likely to regret them than a tattoo with meaning.Tymarah believes that the ink will serve as a reminder of my group of friends and our humour, remarking that lots of people get matching tattoos with friends. Looking ahead to the future, she added: I think it will be so funny to explain to my kids or grandkids what the tattoo is for and play them the song. So many people have tattoos about movie or TV characters, I personally donapost think this is any dferent. Tymarah has since posted a vid of her getting the tattoo on her TikTok, @itstymarah, clocking up almost k likes at the time of writing.The video said: When you definitely just made the best decision of your le... Tell me Iaposm wrong  If every comment is youaposre wrong Iaposm going to die LOL. Thankfully there was plenty of support in the comments, with even the official Spoty account commenting to declare you are an ALL-STAR. Reflecting on how she felt about any potential criticism of her body art, Tymarah reasoned: Personally I think people get super sensitive about other peopleaposs tattoos, itaposs not on your body so why would you care  Have you opted for a funny or unusual tattoo Get in touch.

TikTok star Candice Leigh Clark, @candygirl, shared a video online that showed her cleaning her parentsapos old house, which is now hers.She said that when she went to wipe the walls, the cloth she used was instantly covered in a thick layer of brown grime, and the clean area had changed colour - indicating the whole wall was covered in the muck.

I just always thought it was like a tan-ish colour. Then I was wiping it after my grandma died and woah! Then a second added: Same here. My mum smoked a pack and didnapost clean nothing, Iaposm cleaning all the wall and doors cause I canapost take it anymore looks two shades lighter.  And a third replied: My mum smoked in the house and Iaposm currently going through the same thing. I donapost think people realise how bad smoke is in the house, wrote a fourth.

The worldaposs shortest IQ test is made up of just three maths questions and shouldnapost take too long to complete. But be warned - itaposs pretty tough! Called the Cognitive Reflection Test, the quiz isnapost new, but was originally part of a research paper published in  by MIT professor Shane Frederick. This paper has recently resurfaced online, leaving many keen to give it a go. As part of his research, Professor Frederick had more than , participants from a range of educational backgrounds complete the test - and even those attending top American universities such as Yale and Hard struggled to work out all the answers. Of all those who took part only  percent managed to score three out of three on the test, meaning  percent of people failed - how will you fare   Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Speaking about the test, Professor Frederick, said: The three items on the CRT are aposeasyapos in the sense that their solution is easily understood when explained, yet reaching the correct answer often requires the suppression of an erroneous answer that springs aposimpulsivelyapos to mind. Hereaposs a look at the questions: . A bat and a ball cost . in total. The bat costs  more than the ball. How much does the ball cost  . If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long would it take  machines to make  widgets  . In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes  days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake   These are the three most common answers that people guess - but they are actually incorrect. .  cents .  minutes .  days Professor Frederick adds: Anyone who reflects upon it for even a moment would recognise that the dference between  and  cents is only  cents, not  as the problem stipulates. In this case, catching that error is tantamount to solving the problem, since nearly everyone who does not respond apos centsapos does, in fact give the correct response. The correct answers are: .  cents .  minutes .  days Still puzzled by all of this  Thankfully, Presh Talwalkar, the author of The Hoy of Game Theory: An Introduction to Strategic Thinking explained how to work out the correct answers on his blog, Mind Your Decisions. . Say the ball costs X. Then the bat costs  more, so it is X + . So we have bat + ball  X + . because together they cost .. This means X +   ., then X  ., so X  .. This means the ball costs  cents and the bat costs . . If it takes  machines  minutes to make  widgets, then it takes  machine  minutes to make  widget . If we have  machines working together, then each can make a widget in  minutes. So there will be  widgets in  minutes. . Every day FORWARD the patch doubles in size. So every day BACKWARDS means the patch halves in size. So on day  the lake is half full. How did you do  Let us know in the comments below.

Her son, Jan Rek, lashed out at anti-vaxxers in central Europe for influencing his mother and her decisions. Horka, , was lead singer for Czech folk group Asonance an Jan explained that he and his father, who were both vaccinated, caught Covid over the Christmas holidays. Horka purposely remained in close contact with them both, which led to her catching the virus. Jan also revealed his mother’s final tragic moments before she passed on Sunday. The -year-old remained in good enough health on the morning she died to get dressed for a walk.  But she complained her back was hurting and went to lie down in her bedroom.In an interview with the BBC, Jan said: “In  minutes it was all over. She choked to death.”Horka is thought to have believed thatshe caught the virus, she would not need the vaccine.  Jan explained that while his mother was unvaccinated, she did not subscribe to any of the conspiracy theories around the Covid vaccines. Jan said: “Her philosophy was that she was more OK with the idea of catching Covid than getting vaccinated. Not that we would get microchipped or anything like that.” She celebrated upon learning she had contracted the virus.  Her family said she was “happy” to have Covid because she thought it meant she could obtain a health pass to visit venues those without proof of vaccination or recent recovery are blocked from going to. On her social media just two days before she tragically died, she wrote: “Iaposm very happy about it because in this way I would be able to start having a free le like everyone , and go back to the cinema, on vacation, to take a sauna, to the theater. “I survived… It was intense. So now there will be the theatre, sauna, a concert… and an urgent trip to the sea.”  Jan was left raging with anti-vaxxers in his country who he blamed for her death.On Facebook, following his mother’s death, he wrote: “You took my mother, who based all her arguments on your basis.“I despise you, you are an absolute waste.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Robin and Gavin were accidentally given to the wrong mothers by a nurse at Nigel Hospital in Johannesburg where they were the only two babies born on that day in February .This meant Robin was raised by single mum Sandy Dawkins who was struggling to get by on the outskirts of Johannesburg while Gavin grew up with wealthier parent Megs Clinton Parker in Pietermaritzburg. The mistake was not uncovered until two years later when a disagreement over Gavinaposs rightful father led to a DNA test revealing that Megs was not his birth mother.  Hospital records further confirmed that Robin was Megsapos biological son who was growing up with Sandy as his mother. When faced with swapping their birth sons back, Megs and Sandy chose to keep the children they had raised since birth. Speaking nearer the time, one of the parents told  Minutes Australia: You canapost reject a child that youaposve been so close to for two years. Initially I think you protect the one youaposve got. The first few days are shock, then the curiosity comes. Whereaposs my baby   The boys grew up km apart in very dferent environments and referred to each other as brothers. But Robin has since admitted that he wishes his biological mother fought to switch him back. Speaking at age , he said he had dficulty accepting the situation and misses his mother Megs awfully a lot who he speaks to daily on the phone.  He told how le with Sandy was not easy and that he resented Gavin who does get things easy. If Iaposve ever wanted something, Iaposve had to work towards it. I’ve never just had it come towards me, he added. At the time, Gavin described being “happy” with the le he was accidentally given and that he did not feel sorry for Robin. He said: “Saying I thank my lucky stars every day would be wrong but at the same time I was given a le which I’ve now lived and I’m still living and I don’t regret anything.  The boysapos mothers embraced one another like sisters after discovering the mistake in  but chose not to swap the boys back. But Megs missed her biological son and encouraged him to move halfway across the country to her home with Gavin in , leaving Sandy without a child. Speaking at the time, Sandy said: “I just want to know she’s really happy with what she’s achieved. “I mean she’s ruined people’s lives, there’s just no other way to look at it… she’s ruined mine for starters.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Single mumSouth AfricaParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His visitation rights have been suspended until February, unless the dad gets vaccinated before then. The judgement came after the dad had requested an extra day with his child over the holiday period, according to local reports in Quebec, Canada.Whose side are you on  Have your say in the comment section The mum contested the request after learning from his social media posts that he was not vaccinated. She further requested a suspension of his visitation rights, claiming he would be a conspirator and anti-vaccine. The child has received both their jabs, but the mum lives with her partner and other children under the age of five who are not yet able to get vaccinated. The judge said: In these circumstances, it is not in the best interests of any of the three children that Monsieur can exercise access toat this time.  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.This is not the first reported case of a parent being denied visitation for not having their Covid- vaccine. In New York, a dad was banned from visiting his daughter unless he becomes double-jabbed or agrees to weekly Covid tests. The ruling was made by a New York City orce judge, who suspended the parentaposs visitation rights to see the three-year-old girl until he agrees to either option. Matthew Cooper, who is presiding over the estranged coupleaposs orce and custody dispute, wrote in his ruling: “Here, in-person parental access by the defendant is not in the child’s best interests, and there are exceptional circumstances that support its suspension. “The dangers of voluntarily remaining unvaccinated during access with a child while the Covid- virus remains a threat to children’s health and safety cannot be understated. “Unfortunately, and to my mind, incomprehensibly, a sizeable minority, seizing upon misinformation, conspiracy theories, and muddled notions of ‘inidual liberty,’ have refused all entreaties to be vaccinated.” The ruling requires the unnamed dad to either get the jab or present a weekly PCR test in addition to a biweekly antigen test within  hours of a scheduled visit. He currently visits his daughter every other weekend. The judge wrote that the couple split in  and the proceedings have been contentious with the two wrangling over custody of their daughter. The child resides mostly with her mother in Manhattan, where she attends preschool.

At : GMT on January , the asteroid made its closest approach to Earth since , coming within . million miles of our planet.The clip was captured by Gianluca Masi, manager of the Virtual Telescope Project, at the Bellatrix Astronomical Observatory in Italy. A still from the footage, comes from a single, -second exposure. The telescope tracked the fast apparent motion of the asteroid.  This is why stars show as long trails, while the asteroid looks like a sharp dot of light in the centre of the image, marked by an arrow. The space rock was first discovered in . It orbits the Sun every  days. The last known approach this close was in  when it was , miles from the Earth.  Masi said: We captured several images of the potentially hazardous asteroid PC while safely approaching us. “Using all the images of the sequence, we could make the animation below, showing  PC in motion against the stars.’” NASA estimates the diameter of an asteroid as , feet, much larger than the tallest building on Earth, the Burj Khala in Dubai, which measures , feet.  Following its close approach on Tuesday, won’t be this close to Earth again until the year . NASA and other agencies regularly track more than , known asteroids as they orbit the Sun, and occasionally cross Earth’s orbit - none of the known asteroids is expected to collide with the Earth at any point in the near future, but there are asteroids whose orbits aren’t known.

Ni Putu Melina, , from Bali, tied the knot with a keris dagger as part of a Hindu custom to help deflect shame and humiliation from her family. The groom missed the January  wedding date after stepping down two days earlier. The family changed their mind last minute and no longer wanted him to move in with the bride and her family, the Daily Star reports.Despite their hesitance, the groom declared his love for his almost-bride, saying they should elope to be together. But Melinaaposs family disagreed, advising him against any hasty decisions, opting instead for the symbolic ritual. It is believed that the dagger, which represents manhood, can act as a replacement for grooms who cannot attend in cases including death or other exceptional circumstances. Her family said their daughter needed to go ahead with the wedding to ensure that the baby wouldnapost be seen as an illegitimate child when born, reports Coconuts. But despite the symbolic ceremony, Melinaaposs official documents will state that her child was born by a single mother as she is not legally married, according to the Gianyar Regency Population and Civil Registry.

Her father Ketut Suwardita commented: We want this to be a lesson for other girls who are looking for a groom.

British Foreign Office officials may be rescued by special forces in case of warA Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the front line in Pisky Image: Getty ImagesByChris HughesDefence and Security Editor:,  Jan | comments A secretive SAS unit has been put on standby to “extract” UK officials from Ukrainewar breaks out, the Daily Mirror can reveal. Members of SAS E Squadron will lead a rescueRussian troops and armour pour deep into Ukraine.As many as , Russian combat forces are now amassed close to Ukraine’s border - including ground troops and amphibious attack personnel.More are pouring into neighbouring Belarus, putting Ukraine’s capital Kiev at riskPresident Vladimir Putin orders a full-scale invasion.Moscow’s commanders have ordered large amounts of multi-launch rocket systems to be transported into Belarus, which could be used as a launch point for an invasion. American President Joe Biden has already warned he believes an attack is “imminent” and bungled by hinting an American response depends on the severity of an incursion.Many observers believe full-scale invasion is unlikely butthat takes place British Foreign Office officials may be rescued by special forces. It is believed crack UK special forces may also be placed strategically within Ukraine acting as military advisers, along with US counterparts.  One security source told the Daily Mirror: “British intelligence is watching developments all over Ukraine but in particular in Crimea, which is occupied by Russian forces. “All of the other manoeuvres may have been a ruse to deflect from Crimea and Putin may want to expand it towards contested Donbas.”Tonight the UK Ministry of Defence told the Daily Mirror: We do not comment on special forces. Ukraine’s troops along a -mile trench border through Donbas, in Donestk and Luhansk, are on high alert for an attack by Moscow’s forces. They are preparing to launch a guerrilla warfare against attacking Russian soldiersthey roll over the frontline, using UK-supplied shoulder-launched NLAW missiles. They have pitted crossing points with anti-tank mines and other defences, preparing to retreat and then launch counter-attacks against an invasion force. Experts warned Russia will act quickly and decisivelyit invades. aposRussia to act quickly and decisively in invasion of Ukraineapos Hugo Crosthwaite, lead analyst for Eurasia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly, said the Russian plan was to get concessions on Ukrainian NATO membership and Donbas. Putin is keen to stop Ukraine from becoming a NATO member but the US has insisted on making no promise. Moscow also wants pro-Russian separatist occupied Donbas to be officially part of Russia and some experts believe sanction threats will not deter the Kremlin. He said: “A Russian invasion of Ukraine is a likely scenario in the coming weeks. “There have been several military and diplomatic developments that point to a sustained severe interstate conflict risk, including Russian troops deploying to Belarus and further efforts by the Kremlin to create a pretext for an attack.  “The combined efforts of the US, the EU and NATO to deter Russia in recent months appear to have failed. “Even the sanctions the US has threatened seem to have had little impact, with Russia having effectively sanction-proofed its economy. “Russia’s military build-up means it can now begin a ground operation or launch a devastating missile and artillery attack at little to no notice. “Rhetoric from the Kremlin has become more belligerent, including unevidenced accusations that the US is training ‘anti-Russia’ units and Ukraine is preparing to attack separatist forces in Donbas - a tactic the Kremlin used in  to justy its annexation of Crimea. “We still doubt that Russian forces would attack Kyiv, either via ground assault or air and missiles, and assess that Russia’s main goal in any military operation would be to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to resign quickly, and offer wide-ranging concessions from NATO membership to the status of Donbas.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoEuropean UnionForeign OfficeMinistry of DefenceJoe BidenVladimir PutinSoldiersSpecial forcesUkraine crisisRussiaDaily Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lainie Chait is taking her former employer to the Fair Work Commission, after she says she was sacked for choosing to get vaccinated against coronavirus.But wellness business, the Church of Ubuntu, where Ms Chait had been working since October , claims she was just a contractor.Ms Chait, from Byron Bay in Australia, worked for the Church of Ubuntu’s wellness clinic remotely for one year. The Church claims to be a religious order, who help people and animals struggling with health issues. Ms Chaitaposs lawyer, Mark Swivel, said she didnapost consider herself a member of the church, she was actually simply doing a job for the church. Ms Chait says it was important for her to get vaccinated against Covid-, since she has been living with epilepsy for  years. However, she didnapost think this would mean losing her job. I knew their stance on health, and I aligned with all of that, but I didnapost realise the political agenda that they had about this kind of thing, she told NBN News.  She is now seeking damages, as she claims she was sacked once her boss discovered her vaccination status. The unfair dismissal stems from a simple argument that the employer sacked Lainie when she chose to be vaccinated, Mr Swivel said. When I was hired for the job there was nothing I was talked through to tell me this was a potential outcome, Ms Chait said. Their constitution states they support all health habits and things people do to support their own health, so theyaposve gone against their own constitution, she added.  In a letter to Ms Chait, the church wrote: It is the position of the COU that to receive the COVID- Sars Cov  injection consciously and deliberately with intent is in contradiction with our Constitution and contrary to our position on what is required of us by our Lord God and Creator.Ms Chait’s case comes amid a debate in Australia over the governmentaposs proposed Religious Discrimination Bill and the power of religious organisations to hire and fire based on belief.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EpilepsyCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and

utilising the area#s products including oysters, venison, scallops and meat from Scotland#s only snail farm based in Tayinloan.In addition, there will be new products from the area including trout

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few

related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"a rare but sad find on gigha beach","story":"#Unfortunately, the poor thing was not alive when we found it,# said Ms Zammit, #but the stranding was reported to the Marine Conservation Society.#It#s a pretty important species.

French electricity for the same year is, on the other hand, heavily dominated by nuclear sources , leaving other sources in its wake – hydro , and windnatural gas is in fourth. The energy mix in the UK is therefore arguably far more balanced, greener, and sustainable than that of the French, and the UK Government deserves some credit for enabling it to be this way.Also, it is worth noting that in placing a cap in the prices EDF can charge, the French Government and presumably, by inference the taxpayer, has an immediate £ billion financial hit to manage.

But each member of the quintet is there on merit, and, while facing stf competition from established names for a place in a Six Nations matchday , they are all in the form that suggests they would distinguish themselvescalled upon.Scrum-half Ben Vellacott, for example, has excelled since joining Edinburgh in the close season. He did not get his chance in the autumn internationals as Townsend preferred to go with the three Glasgow s - Ali Price, George Horne and Jamie Dobie - but has now edged ahead of the latter two. At present Price is one of the first names on the team sheet, having matured signicantly as an inidual player and as a leader over the past year, but Vellacott and London Irish scrum-half Ben White, another uncapped member of the squad, will at least keep him on his toes.In common with Cameron Redpath, who is back in the squad after injury, White played age-group rugby for England, but has been on Townsend’s radar for some time. “We’ve been watching him the last couple of seasons,” the coach said. “This year he’s played a lot of rugby with London Irish, and we’ve been connecting with him since around November.“Scrum-half is one of those positions where we have a lot of competition. Two players who were involved in November are no longer involved in this campaign, but that’s testament to the work of both Bens, the form that they’re in.” While Vellacott moved north from Wasps before getting his chance, London Irish winger Kyle Rowe went in the opposite direction, leaving Edinburgh last summer after making a solitary appearance. “He got into the team at London Irish through some really good pre-season performances then has backed it up throughout the season,” Townsend said of Rowe, who scored in his team’s - win over Edinburgh last Saturday. “Some consistent performances show he’s an exciting player that we want to work with.”In the pack, Saracens back-row Andy Christie, like Rowe, has thrived this season when thrown in at the deep end in the Premiership. “He’s a lovely lad,” the coach continued. “This year he’s broken through. It’s weird. Sometimes players don’t stand out at a lower level, they stand out at a higher level, and that’s what we’ve seen with Andy. “He played No  against Edinburgh and Gloucester, his best position is probably six, he’s developing as a lineout forward and he can also play seven. He’s a back row we like: we like back rows who are adaptable, quick and work hard and he’s all that.”Glasgow’s Rory Darge is the fth uncapped member of the squad and another who is included on the back of some phenomenal performances at club level. The quandary for Townsend is that, unlike Christie, the Warriors player is a specialist openside - as is Hamish Watson, who has been seen in recent seasons as close to indispensable. So how can Darge be accommodated  “That’s a question we’re pondering now,” Townsend said. “Hamish was Six Nations player of the championship last year and went on the Lions tour. Hamish is one of the best players in the northern hemisphere, and we’ve got someone who has had an outstanding season with Glasgow, performing really well in the big games.”  With England first up at BT Murrayfield on Saturday  February, the majority of the uncapped quintet may well have to wait until later in the tournament to make their debuts. After all, this Scotland team now has a strong and still expanding core of players who, all  being equal, can be expected to be in the . In addition to Price and Watson, captain Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Zander Fagerson, Jamie Ritchie and Jonny Gray come into that category.As ever, there are signicant omissions from the squad. In addition to Horne and Dobie, Adam Hastings has been left out, for example, with Blair Kinghorn now earmarked as back-up stand-off to Russell. Fraser Brown appears to have paid the penalty for having played little rugby since ing from injury, while his Glasgow colleague Oli Kebble has been surprisingly left out after being included in the autumn as someone who can play on either side of the front row. Centres Huw Jones and James Lang, of Harlequins and Edinburgh respectively, are another two who will have to wait patiently for the later rounds of the tournament."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12802362.jpg?type=article-full","title":"skye-bridge-ministers-plan-mull-crossing","story":"A new plan seeks to replace ferries with the fixed links  years after the opening of the Skye bridge was mired in controversy.For decades islanders had called for a road bridge from the mainland as growing visitor numbers put a strain on the ferry that ran between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin.But the cost of the bridge’s tolls sparked outrage. Car drivers were charged up to £. each way, compared to p on the Forth Road Bridge. Protesters claimed this made the Skye crossing the most expensive road toll in Europe.Now net zero, energy and transport secretary Michael Matheson has unveiled a plan that could see another crossing to Mull, which has been hit with ferry disruption.  A bridge from Oban to the nearest community on Mull would be around ten miles long.He also talks of a plan of a fixed link between North and South Uist and Lewis and Harris.Another bridge or tunnel could link Barra and the Uists.He said: \"That could improve communities access to goods and services, making these islands more attractive for people to live and work in and visit.\"The plans are amongst  recommendations in the second Strategic Transport Projects Review which ministers say seek to make Scotland \"more sustainable and support people to make better, more informed choices on how they travel.Transport Scotland said: \"When implemented, the changes and measures will play a key role in helping to make the country fairer and greener - by tackling tackle climate change, reducing inequalities and improving our health and wellbeing.\"Recommendations also involve a multi-billion-pound Clydewhich would connect the city centre with eight surrounding local authorities. Transport Scotland said that when complete it could \"better connect over . million people to employment, education and health services in and around the Glasgow city region\".Plans for Edinburgh  South East Scotland Mass Transit and Aberdeen Rapid Transit will also be developed.According to the review analysis the moves for bridges or tunnels have come as current ferry routes on the Sound of Harris, Sound of Barra and between Craignure on Mull and Oban face a \"number of issues and challenges\".It says: \"Replacing ferry services with fixed links bridges or tunnel can improve reliability, connectivity, capacity and crossing times.\"A Sound of Harris fixed link would improve connectivity between the Uists and Lewis Harris while a Sound of Barra fixed link would improve connectivity between Barra and the Uists.\"The provision of these fixed links would allow for the reconfiguration of transport provision between the Outer Hebrides and the mainland.\"The provision of a fixed link between Mull and the Scottish mainland would allow for the reconfiguration of transport provision between the island and the mainland.\"Further work is now to be undertaken on business cases to better understand the benefits, costs and challenges associated with these options.The analaysis said the studies would \"consider the feasibility of replacing existing ferry services\" currently delivered by CalMac as part of the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Servicescontract.The analysis added: \"These studies would also ascertain the potential savings associated with the public sector subsidies required to operate the ferry services and involve input from communities that may potentially be affected.\"Ministers have also set out a hope to improve active travel infrastructure by encouraging more people to walk, wheel and cycle more often and therefore cut carbon emissions and improve health and well-being, particularly of children, while supporting sustainable economic growth.It set out a plan to develop a net zero freight and logistics network for Scotland \"that would encourage the switch from road to rail or water and reduce the overall distance travelled, including a review of rail freight terminals hubs\".Transport Scotland said: \"These investments will help reduce overall demand for private vehicles improve accessibility to employment, education, healthcare and leisure

In addition, millions of people from other nationalities, minorities and targeted groups were killed, according to the draft resolution.“We now live in an era in which fiction is becoming fact and the Holocaust is becoming a distant memory,” Israel’s UN Ambassador, Gilad Erdan, told the assembly in urging support for the resolution.“And as this happens following the greatest crime in human history, now comes the greatest cover-up in human history.”Erdan, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, said the resolution is a commitment to make sure that Holocaust distortion and denial “will be tolerated no more”.He said social media s including Facebook, Twitter and You Tube are spreading the “pandemic of distortions and lies” about the Holocaust.“Social media giants can no longer remain complacent to the hate spread on their s” and must take action now, the Israeli ambassador said.The resolution commends countries that have preserved Nazi death camps and other sites from the Holocaust and urges the  UN member states “to develop educational programmes that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide”.It requests the UN and its agencies to continue developing and implementing programmess aimed at countering Holocaust denial and distortions and to mobilise civil society and others to provide truthful facts about the Holocaust.Currently, the UN has an outreach programme on the Holocaust and the UN Educational, Scientic and Cultural Organization, Unesco, has a programme on Holocaust education and combatting antisemitism.Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but do reflect global opinion.The General Assembly designated January , the day the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated by the Soviet army, as the annual International Day of Commemoration in memory of victims of the Holocaust in .The resolution underlines that remembrance “is a key component to the prevention of further acts of genocide”.It says Holocaust denial “refers to discourse and propaganda that deny the historical reality and the extent of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis and their accomplices during World War II” and “any attempt to claim that the Holocaust did not take place” or call into doubt that gas chambers, mass shooting, starvation, and intentional genocide were used against the Jewish people.The resolution says distorting or denying the Holocaust also refers to “intentional efforts to excuse or minimise” the role of Nazi collaborators and allies, “gross minimisation” of the number of victims, “attempts to blame the Jews for causing their own genocide,” statements casting the Holocaust as a positive event, and attempt to “blur the responsibility” for establishing concentration and death camps “by putting blame on other nations or ethnic groups.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is the beautul part of football and hopefully we can try to make this a very big step.“We have to take a lot from this game and try to build on this.”The late drama saw the team connect with their fans in a way they have not done in recent years as there were raucous scenes of celebration after Bergwijn’s winner in the sixth minute of time added on.Bergwijn and Harry Kane were hugging random Spurs fans, while Lucas Moura climbed on the shoulders of a steward.Hojbjerg, who played a part in both Bergwijn goals, revelled in sharing the joy with the fans.A post shared by Tottenham Hotspur “First of all emotionally it was very high and low, you go from two minutes away from a loss to two minutes later actually winning the game,” he said.“So in that way the spirit, the mentality, the courage to play forward and attack not just for the draw but for the win, I have to pay compliment to the whole team.“Also how the away fans pushed us, we really felt them through the whole game so it was only correct how we celebrate the third goal, going to them and enjoying everyone together.“That is what football is all about, they are supporting us and we are here fighting for them and how it came together at the end was a massive joy.“Honestly we did and that is why we celebrated like we did, for them and us a massive joy and to share that the joy becomes even bigger.“A big compliment to everyone who had Spurs in their heart in the stadium.”Iconic. 🇧🇷Spurs through and through 💙 pic CjtgrJ— Tottenham HotspurJanuary , The win sees Spurs move on to the shoulder of the top four, but with games in hand, and they appear to be moving in the right direction under Conte.The Denmark midfielder says there is still more to come.“It is step by step and at the end of the season we can talk about the left or right,” he added.“It is step by step, we are working well, everyone is focused, it is a demanding period but we are ready to suffer and improve.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia. My own objective was to learn to speak Gaelic, a language I had not heard until I set foot on the island, which in those days was almost entirely Gaelic-speaking.Canna House, where Campbell lived with his we Margaret Fay Shaw, had much  to offer: a well-stocked Celtic library , and just as important, a series of Gaelic and literary visitors, arriving from all over western Europe and North America.

When I stung my hand on the nettles, she said to apply a leaf of dock growing nearby.It gave instant relief, and she observed that the two plants were never far apart. She then recited a rhyme which I did not remember as well as I should have, but was able to recover years later from a neighbour from the Glen:‘Dock leaf smooth, mild, gentleThe nettle has stung me’Three decades later, when the project was only in its initial stages, John Lorne Campbell was approached about making available his extensive collection of field recordings to this national resource.As a long-time lover of technology as well as Gaelic traditions, he agreed without a moment’s hesitation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

So far the youths have engaged in wanton vandalism of ious areas of the village including putting dog faeces through letter boxes and damaging the villagersquos Christmas tree and festive lights last month.The RUC says it is vital that members of the public provide information which will bring an end of the vandalism problem.ldquoWe need the help of the community to bring those responsible to court, and without that help it will be very dficult to put an end to this problem, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Management at the GPT telecommunications plant in Ballynahinch have pledged to work towards ensuring that it continues to have a future following the weekend announcement of  redundancies.The company, which manufactures hi-tech switching equipment for the telecommunications industry, revealed on Friday that it is to slice its workforce by more than half.The job losses will reduce the workforce at the Antrim Road plant to .

The only good news is that we will not be closing and are hoping that a leaner and fitter plant can be a springboard for the future, said Mr OrsquoNeill.DRUMANESS ndash Around forty villagers from Drumaness rolled up their sleeves on Sunday to give the local mill pond a much-needed clean-up.The Friends of Drumaness Dam group pulled a large quantity of rubbish out of the pond in the first of a series of work days aimed at improving the area.Fallen branches which had been washed into the dam were removed with the aid of ropes, while rubbish dumped in the centre of the pond was removed by boat. The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight. Rabbits instinctively freeze when caught in a beam of light making them sitting targets for anyone with a shotgun.However, the sudden spread of the problem has alarmed the RUC which is appealing for people not to take part in what is regarded as a ldquohighly dangerous occupation.COMBER ndash Plans for the second stage of the Comber by-pass have been postponed for four years, it has been revealed.Strangford Ulster Unionist MP, Mr John Taylor, said he has been informed of the decision which he says has left him ldquoshell-shocked.ldquoTogether with local councillors and Comber businessmen I have been campaigning for many years to get the by-pass built. It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history.

The Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolsand the wider Catholic school community are extremely concerned at the choice of words used by UUP leader Doug Beattie MLA when he declared the “need to end educational apartheid”.[In a press release last Friday he had declared: “We need to end educational apartheid which is taking place here. We need a single education system in Northern Ireland that allows them to do that.”]Catholic schools and many others across the education sector firmly reject the use of this inflammatory language as they work tirelessly to promote a shared educational landscape.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.CCMS categorically rejects the very idea that Catholic schools are isive or that they stand in opposition to an inclusive and erse education system.Catholic schools promote the dignity and worth of every human person the purpose and value of education the relationship between education, family, and the local community and the purpose and meaning of le itself.The terminology used by Mr Beattie is not helpful and is representative of the misconception that schools that do not have an integrated status are not welcoming and inclusive, particularly given the long-standing work that has gone on in not only Catholic schools but rather all schools to promote shared education. The one-dimensional and isive ‘segregated VS integrated’ dichotomy suggests that there is only one way forward, namely making all schools ‘integrated’.There is in fact a wide spectrum of approaches to break down barriers, end ision and promote a unied, strong society. Catholic schools and others continue to work together to realise this ideal.I would welcome the opportunity to share with Mr Beattie the context of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland, their vision and purpose and the important role that Catholic schools exercise in educating and enriching the lives of everyone in their host communities.Equally, I would encourage Mr Beattie to discuss with both myself and colleagues across the education sector the positive changes that many governors, principals, staff, children, and young people have cultivated in their communities through shared education programmes and partnerships across Northern Ireland.Catholic schools firmly believe that no child should be left behind.Our vision is to enable all young people to meet their full potential, through access to a high-quality education irrespective of location, socio-economic background, ability, or gender.Catholic schools wish to cultivate an education system which guarantees all children will be equally supported to fulfil their potential.The challenge for all of us is to build a fair and respectful society. Education and all of our schools have a very important role to play in progressing this vision – maintained, controlled, integrated, Irish medium and grammar.However, this can only workwe all continue to work together and in this regard the label of educational apartheid is extremely unhelpful.– Gerry Campbell is Chief Executive of CCMSMore from the News Letter: Click here: Higgins in spotlight over political neutrality ahead of major Bloody Sunday event following ‘sectarian NI state’ comments from organisers Click here: VIDEO: Move to rename Prince Andrew Way – one of four such roads in Northern Ireland – as mother shreds his royal status Click here: VIDEO: The most stunning photos of Northern Ireland from the air – as taken by the PSNI helicopter squad over the last year Click here: WATCH: Odd speech by chief NI Protocol negotiator Liz Truss shows her enraged by imported cheese but overjoyed at pork marketsA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

An MP elected to Stormont, or vice versa, has to relinquish one of the two seats.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The government planned to amend this rule so that an MP elected to Stormont could hold on to their Westminster seat until the next general election. This was seen as an attempt to help Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been stymied in his bid to lead the DUP from Stormont. Under present rules,he becomes an MLA he will have to surrender his Lagan Valley seat, triggering a by election. The DUP is favourite to win such a contest but the unionist vote might split three ways and Alliance is strong in the constituency. Under the plans, a by election would not be needed. But the proposal caused uproar. The Labour Party, which in fact mooted the change months ago, saw how the wind was blowing and turned against it.All the main rival parties to the DUP had jointly opposed it.And then, yesterday, Boris Johnson revealed he did too, and had decided to bin the proposal, leaving Sir Jeffrey humiliated . The public is said to oppose double jobbing but there was little sign it did. Supporters of all parties routinely voted for politicians with dual mandates. Once a ban was introduced in NI, it should have been akin to that in Scotland, where election victors can hold on to both seats until the next election. But a belated moved to bring NI into line with that rule looked like an inappropriate bid to help the DUP. But the proposal,implemented, would be much less bad than the special dispensation given to Sinn Fein to get expenses while not taking their MP seats. There is no cross-party opposition to that deal. The prime minister’s sudden u-turn, when he is under huge political pressure, will remind the DUP of his unreliable nature.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And evenit was, the public could have misread such remarks as meaning they were in great danger, when it became apparent late last month that omicron was having a minor health impact. However, it is welcome to hear Dr Black now speak in a reassuring way, and admit that “our worst expectations haven’t been reached”. The covid crisis is not yet over – there have been too many twists and turns so far to be sure of any scenarios in the near future – but it is at a sufficiently mild level where we cannot tolerate the ruin of certain livelihoods and groups of people.Most society leaders — medical, scientic and political —who have demanded rigid controls are themselves financially untouched by lockdown because they are paid by the state.If lockdown does , the financial burden should be more evenly spread so that there is extra money for sectors such as hospitality. Politicians could show leadership by accepting voluntary pay cuts. But let us hope that it does not .We cannot keep planning for worst case scenarios of virus mutations. Best to continue to try to get almost everyone jabbed, to encouragemask wearing as a considerate behaviour, to warn vulnerable groups of the ongoing risks, and then open up fully.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Credit : Rob Youngson   Focus FeaturesThe film starts with the jollity of a tight-knit terraced neighbourhood being shattered by a riot intended to intimidate Catholics into moving out.Given the starting point, the threat of violence looms large for the entire film but it is not a well which Branagh taps too often. Instead he celebrates togetherness rather than ision, helped by a stand-out cast including Ciaran Hinds, Judi Dench, Caitriona Balfe and Jamie Dornan.There are bits of dialogue reminiscent of the Derry Girls scene listing the dferences between the two religions that bring a chuckle.For example when Buddy, who doesn’t want to go to church, points out: “But Daddywe were Catholics we could not go to church, then every once in a wee while we could do it and confess. And then they’d have to tell us we were forgiven and we wouldn’t have to go in again for ages.”The film does have a certain feel-good factor which belies its backdrop. Ultimately, it could mean that Branagh’s heartwarming story, aided by an uplting soundtrack from Belfast’s own Van Morrison, is better received internationally rather than locally, where we’ve grown accustomed to expecting the worst to happen.Whether you’re watching the film in Belfast, Beirut or Boston it is hard to find fault in the film’s visual integrity – its wonderful black and white imagery is captivating on the silver screen.The often dark Northern Irish sense of humour is also given a good showcase, like when Buddy is trying to solve a mathematical problem with his granddad who tells him to make his numbers indistinct so his teacher will give him the benefit of the doubt.“But there’s only one right answer,” says Buddy.His Pop replies: “If that were true, son, people wouldn’t be blowing themselves up all across town.”• Belfast opens in the UK on Friday, January , though some special screenings of the film are taking place in Belfast this evening ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

All Rights Reserved. WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature SHOWBIZ Film Reviews.“The Strand has a lot of similarities to the Troxy, the same architect. It feels quite nostalgic watching it in a picture house whenever you’re looking at another cinema from the same era.”Although the film’s UK release date is given as Friday , special screenings will take place in Belfast tomorrow evening before opening across Northern Ireland on Friday. Mimi said the film had generated a lot of interest prior to its release: “We’ve seen a lot more interest than we normally would.“People are really interested and intrigued, I think people hold Kenneth Branagh in such a sense of pride. He has given back an enormous amount to our creative industry in Northern Ireland, championing what he considers his home town.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle looks ahead to the UK cinema release of Sir Kenneth Branaghs Belfast film“The audience are interested, particularly those middle-aged and senior, who will remember the era.”Jude Hill plays nine-year-old Buddy, a role based on Branagh himself, in the film which also stars Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Caitriona Balfe and Judi Dench as members of Buddy’s family.It is set at the beginning of the Troubles, but violence, although occasional, is not to the fore in the film.Mimi said: “I think the Troubles is more of a backdrop. It’s incidental to the characters.“There’s definitely a sense that it’s written for a global audience more than a Northern Ireland audience.“It’s got that nostalgia, that wholesomeness which the American love about all things Northern Irish or Irish.”She added: “This is just one person’s story, one person’s memory and obviously stories and narratives change with memory.“It’s that kind of sepia, rose-tinted view that comes whenever you have memories.“Because it is set here I know Kenneth Branagh and Jamie Dornan have said in interviews that they are more nervous that people here will enjoy it and accept it.”Of the staggered release which has seen the film open in America and other parts of the world before the UK, Mimi said: “It is unusual because of pirating for a film not to have one international release date.“People here will already have seen the film, but not on the big screen as it was meant to be showcased.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
