But a couple spending £45 would pay £25.Soft drinks will be included in the deal although alcohol will not.Meals must be consumed on the premises so takeaway food won\u0027t count.

As the train snakes its way into the city centre, a trio of fine brick chimneys is revealed at a bend in the river, each styled after a different Italian renaissance tower. One mimics Giotto’s Campanile in Florence, another echoes the Torre dei Lamberti in Verona, while a third recalls a Tuscan towerhouse in San Gimignano. It was the ornate fantasy of Victorian industrialist Colonel Thomas Harding, who hired architect William Bakewell to conjure the most beautiful ventilation shafts that a Yorkshire pin factory had ever seen.In recent years, this sophisticated scene has been overshadowed by towers of a different kind. First came the ranks of tacky waterside apartments, each topped with a jaunty curved roof, adding a touch of service station chic. Then came Bridgewater Place, the tallest building in Yorkshire, which squats like a bulky grey Dalek on the skyline. Its malevolence extends beyond its looks alone: the wind created by this “killer tower” at street level swept a lorry on to the pavement, crushing a man to death, and has injured others.Now all of this is to be trumped by the most audacious shaft that God’s Own Country has ever seen. Rising to 46 storeys, Two Springwell Gardens is planned to be the new tallest building in Yorkshire, a 142-metre glass monolith rising from the industrial sheds of Holbeck. In a Ballardian flourish, it promises to house glamorous “sky gardens”, where spiral staircases wind their way through luscious hanging plants. Cocooned inside these sealed vertical patios, residents will experience “an enhanced sense of community” as they look down on the surrounding landscape of builders’ depots and tyre shops.The building “has a bold visual identity, thanks to a distinctive sail-like facade”, says Antony Georgallis, director of local developer Citylife, which was founded five years ago and has yet to realise a completed building. “By being brave with our design, if planning is granted, we will contribute towards a new skyline for the city.”Sadly, for the future residents of the high-rise, it seems like both developer and architect, Nick Brown, have been so focused on the skyline that they forgot to think enough about the inside. When the building’s floor plans were first revealed on social media, architects and planners were aghast. “Inhumane, incompetent, inexcusable,” was the verdict of housing expert Claire Bennie, former development director of the Peabody housing association. “Abomination!” added another.Cramming 16 apartments per floor around a single access core, with just one escape staircase, the plan looks like some contorted Space Invaders monster with a fire-hazard death-wish. Some flats have been so shoehorned into the corners that they necessitate having 12-metre-long windowless corridors to reach them. The mirrored pairs of crooked passages extend from the lift core like great fallopian tubes, pregnant with the promise of an endless journey from the front door to the living room through a one-metre wide tunnel. Some flats seem to be one-third corridor. As one commenter put it: “The apartments are basically just corridors of varying width, from depressing to furniture-containing.” The “affordable” flats, meanwhile, have been tucked into the armpits of the H-shaped plan, recessed in the shadow of their neighbours.Architect Nick Brown is sanguine: “Our approach is to work to the technical regulations and take it to the limit of what is acceptable within those boundaries,” he says. He also thinks the long windowless corridors could be a positive feature. “Residents could actually turn those corridors into a gallery or something,” he says. “It’s part of the arrival sequence, building up to the amazing views you’ll get when you reach the apartment.”The Leeds Civic Trust is not convinced. “This is a scheme that’s trying to do far too much with the space available,” says the trust’s director, Martin Hamilton. “Some of the flats will get very little natural light, and there’s no private amenity space for the residents. It looks like a pokey arrangement for coming and going, and the single escape stair is a real safety concern for a building of this height.”Brown responds: ‘We’ve been working with fire consultants and we are satisfied that it is safe and it meets the requirements. Every apartment is sprinklered, and the core is the required size for the building, with compartmentalisation and two-hour fire protection. We are aware of the sensitivities of tall buildings and we continue to challenge ourselves.’The scheme would fail to meet the London housing standards on multiple fronts. Sixteen flats is twice the number permitted to be accessed from a single core for safety reasons, while daylight and natural ventilation are also required for communal corridors. The lack of personal outdoor space for each flat wouldn’t meet the standard either. “We originally had balconies, connected by a green wall,” says Brown. “But we had to get rid of the green wall due to fire regulations. Then the balconies became too exposed and windy to use.” He says residents will be able to use the courtyard of their neighbouring scheme, One Springwell Gardens, an (unbuilt) lower-rise block that received planning permission in 2017. The civic trust has pointed out that the tower would cast this space, and the building itself, in shadow for much of the day.For those who have been watching the Leeds development scene over the years, this tower may be the tallest, but it represents a new low. “It’s appalling,” says architectural historian Ken Powell, who has been involved with Leeds since the 1970s, working with Save Britain’s Heritage and castigating the so-called “Leeds Look” – a kind of joyless postmodernism featuring red bricks, grey slate roofs – that emerged in the 1980s and 90s. “It’s just another large object stuck in space, without any concern for its context. The city needs some kind of vision, which they simply do not have. These tall buildings have sprung up in a very unplanned way, just dumped along the fringes of the city centre in a meaningless jumble.”Like Powell, he sees it as a symptom of the lack of an overarching vision for the city. “Leeds is really two cities,” he says. “It’s got the really good stuff in the centre – very urban and quite cosmopolitan – then this no man’s land pretty much all the way around it, that’s been messed up by highways and demolitions and the loss of industry. Then all this new stuff is being scattered around in a random fashion. When you’re there, it feels like there’s no urban structure.”Two Springwell Gardens is the latest of a rash of tall buildings in the city, many of which have sprung up around the Leeds Arena to the north, forming a notional “cluster”. “From a distance, it looks quite impressive now,” says Jones. “Then when you actually reach them, the quality is terrible.”The chief offender of the bunch is the Opal 3 Tower, a 25-storey cliff face of student flats punctured by tiny square windows and topped with an inexplicable red triangular crown, like some bloated rooster. The work of Derby-based Morrison Design, it was the tallest building in the area until the arrival of the Sky Plaza tower, a 37-storey silo of 557 student flats designed by Leeds stalwarts Carey Jones. It was clad, until recently, in the same kind of flammable aluminium composite panels that clothed Grenfell Tower. There are several more similar towers on the way nearby, including another pair of tombstones for Unite, rising to 27 storeys, and Altus House, a lacklustre 38-storey doppelganger of its neighbours. Sharing the same palette of whitish cladding, this north end of Leeds is starting to look like a depot of discarded fridges.“There is a recent tendency for the council to say, ‘Well, we’ve approved something that looks like this in this area, so we want something similar,’” says Hamilton. “Sure, it may be policy-compliant, but something that offers a contrast would be more welcome. Our concern is that you end up with a rather monotonous blancmange, rather than something more interesting.”A spokesperson for Leeds City Council said: “The Council determines all planning applications on their inidual merits, including applications for ‘tall buildings’, in accordance with national and local planning policy guidance and legislation.”Like many cities, Leeds has always had a fairly permissive approach to tall buildings, sitting back and seeing what developers offer, rather than proactively masterplanning in advance. Tower locations seem to be justified after the event, any notional “strategy” playing catch-up with the market. The council issued a new draft Tall Buildings Design Guide for consultation last year, but it still lacks teeth, full of vague principles that seem intentionally open to interpretation. The council says responses to the consultation are still being considered to help prepare any second future version, prior to any formal adoption. For developers, the flexibility is a boon.“The planning system in Leeds tends to be reactive,” says Brown, who is also a co-director of the Citylife development company. “For us, that leaves the window open to propose things and come forward with our own thoughts on what the skyline should be.” So is this city-fringe area of warehouses, woodyards and kerb-crawlers really the right place for Yorkshire’s tallest tower?“Normally, the tallest building arrives last, as the crowning glory of a regenerated area,” says Brown. “We’re doing it back to front. It’s a real stake in the ground for Holbeck.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76d4126c555b93bc3d9ccec48abe26a01e2f8bda/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e9c0e911cc241f7188718c9e0211d9","title":"living off grid slab city california matt stuart in pictures","story":"Situated on a former military base in the Sonoran desert, just north of the Mexican border in California, Matt Stuart found this DIY community boasts skate parks, hot springs – and dismembered dolls"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20b7b04b7c5fd1e5108b20aeaae6364e7780b1e/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=446d2f26c09349e7350bf0ba6701d81f","title":"summer statement 2020 ifs airs doubts on unprecedented uk economic stimulus","story":"Thinktank fears deficit will go higher, new job retention plan is wasteful, and questions stamp duty and VAT cutsBritain is in the middle of an unprecedented crisis but some things never change. On the day after a budget or a mini-budget, the chancellor of the exchequer can expect to have what he considers a flawless package picked apart by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Rishi Sunak’s summer statement was not accompanied by new forecasts for the economy and the public finances but there was still plenty for the thinktank that specialises in all things to do with tax, spending and budget deficits to get its teeth into.The IFS had five key things to say. First, the scale of the support provided by the state this year has been unprecedented. At the time of his budget in March, Sunak announced £12bn of measures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. That has now risen to £190bn. Factor in the loss of tax revenue and the budget deficit this year is heading for £150bn.Second, the deficit could well be higher than that because the chancellor will probably need to come back with extra support in his autumn budget. The IFS thinks next year’s deficit will be around £150bn.Third, Sunak’s replacement for the furlough scheme – the Job Retention Bonus – is unlikely to save that many jobs and will result in a lot of money wasted on workers who would have been kept on by their employers anyway.Fourth, the IFS has its doubts about the timing and the duration of the temporary cuts in stamp duty and VAT. It is unclear, according to the thinktank, whether hospitality businesses are being affected by weak demand – in which case a VAT cut will help – or by social distancing, in which case it won’t. The economy could be still be struggling when the tax holidays end in early 2021, it added.Finally, it estimates there will eventually need to be spending cuts or (more likely) tax increases amounting to £35bn to £40bn to complete the repair job on the public finances. The good news for Sunak is that there is no need to do so this year or next. The bad news is that when he does get round to tightening policy the next election will be drawing ever closer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db278a9fb39ba558aa30c586fa4a109b7df07713/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0695718c14125b038a14c7347702d5e","title":"us unemployment weekly numbers coronavirus reopenings","story":"Number of new filings decreased since April peak but remained above a million each week since forced shutdowns beganAs new Covid-19 cases continue to surge in states throughout the US, another 1.3 million people filed for unemployment last week, highlighting the grim reality that any type of economic recovery may be far off.While the number of new unemployment filings has decreased significantly since it peaked in April at 6 million people filing in one week, it has remained above a million each week since forced shutdowns began.Last week, nearly 100,000 less people filed for unemployment compared with the week before, continuing a 15-week decrease in the number of new filings.But over the last few weeks, a number of states have shown an alarming uptick in new cases. The US reached 130,000 deaths due to the virus this week, the highest of any country. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said earlier this week that states and cities reopened too quickly, causing a record-breaking number of new cases.In response to the rapid increase of infections, states like Florida, California and Texas have had to reverse reopening measures, once again shutting down businesses, especially bars and restaurants. Economists say the effects of these reversals will likely show in the coming weeks.And even though some jobs have come back, millions more are still indefinitely out of work. States have been working through their backlog of unemployment claims, trying to update systems working at overcapacity to handle the number of new unemployment applications.Antonio Diaz of Miami, Florida, filed for unemployment when he was laid off from his job as a bellman at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami, where he has worked for over 15 years. He received one $275 check from the state in April once his application went through, but has not received another payment since. Attempts to contact the state department in charge of distributing unemployment insurance have failed, and Diaz is quickly running out of savings.On top of dealing with a halt in his income, Diaz’s grandfather and father have both died from the virus, leaving him to take care of his grandmother.“I feel a mix of emotion,” Diaz said in Spanish through a translator. “I feel rage with the governor, with him holding on to our unemployment checks, and then at the same time, throughout this, I feel sadness because I’m still grieving and I have to take care of my grandmother.“Without this help from Florida unemployment, it has made this whole process a lot more difficult and it’s made it more difficult for me to be able to support her.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2fbeffaf35eb30dc7a75f5672bfbe2aa5c4da46/0_292_5111_3068/master/5111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e725ea811b16b04f02a2a335d03a56bf","title":"german exports covid 19 economy us jobless business live","story":"Grim day in UK retail as Boots announces plans to cut 4,000 jobs and John Lewis Partnership shuts eight storesA late newsflash: Ireland’s finance minister Paschal Donohoe, has been elected as president of the eurogroup -- the gathering of eurozone finance chiefs.It’s an important role - Donohoe must start by helping to steer the eurozone towards agreeing a comprehensive recovery package.And that really is all for tonight...And finally, here’s our latest news story on today’s job losses:Boots and John Lewis have announced plans to cut 5,300 jobs and close stores on another bleak day for the UK high street.John Lewis also announced on Thursday that it is planning to permanently close eight of its 50 stores, including full department stores in Birmingham and Watford, with the likely loss of 1,300 jobs.That’s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GWToday’s flurry of job cuts came as Britain’s leading tax and spending thinktank has criticised the flagship policies in Rishi Sunak’s £30bn summer statement.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the key measures were badly timed, poorly targeted and likely to do little to stop unemployment from rising.The IFS said most of the £9.4bn allocated for the government’s £1,000 job retention bonus scheme – to incentivise employers to take back furloughed staff – would be spent on jobs that were already safe.It also said tax increases would be required from 2022 onwards to pay for the government’s Covid-19 response, while warning that the government’s budget deficit – the gap between state expenditure and tax revenue – would reach £350bn this year, the highest level in peacetime for 300 years.The UK government took another step towards reopening the economy this afternoon, announcing plans for beauty salons, spas, gyms, pools and leisure centres to restart.However, there will be restriction on how these places operate, including reduced class sizes and booking systems. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has also said musicians and artists can perform live outside from this weekend - an “important milestone”.Our main UK coronavirus liveblog has all the details: Time for a recap:Thousands more jobs are being lost across the UK as businesses reel from the impact of Covid-19, prompting criticism that the government isn’t doing enough to support the economy.High street bellwether John Lewis is shuttering eight stores, including full-size department stores in Watford and Birmingham. Four ‘At Home’ shops at Croyden, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth are closing permanently, and small outlets at Heathrow and St Pancras as also being axed. In total, 1,300 jobs are at risk.John Lewis blamed the move towards online shopping, which has accelerated as people have obeyed the lockdown and worked from homeChair Sharon White said it was necessary to close these sites, which had all been struggling before the pandemic. Another 42 stores are being reopened.But the move was heavily criticised by former managing director Andy Street, now mayor of the West Midlands. He claimed shutting the Birmingham store would be a “terrible mistake”.Around 4,000 staff are also being let go at high street chemist Boots. Its owner, Walgreens, has decided to cut staff and close scores of Opticians outlets, after suffering a dramatic slump in takings.Sebastian James, the managing director of Boots UK, said the cuts would create “a stronger and more modern Boots”“We recognise that today’s proposals will be very difficult for the remarkable people who make up the heart of our business, and we will do everything in our power to provide the fullest support during this time.”Boris Johnson’s spokesman says the government will do everything it can to help.But...opposition MPs have blamed the government. Lucy Powell MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers, said Rishi Sunak should have announced more focused measures yesterday, rather than meal deal vouchers and a blanket £1,000 bonus for taking furloughed staff back:“The Chancellor’s statement was a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it.“Ministers must acknowledge that different parts of our economy face very different challenges in the months ahead and come forward with a real plan to protect jobs in sectors fully closed or only partially reopened, and develop an urgent programme to boost retailers and save our high streets from becoming ghost towns.”Hundreds of jobs are also being cut at Wales Celtic Manor Resort, with billionaire owner Sir Terry Matthews criticised for not providing more support to staff.Rolls-Royce is also pressing on with a job cuts programme - 2,000 staff are expected to take voluntary severance by August. It has burned through £3bn of cash since the pandemic began, as its lucrative engine servicing business has dried up.The UK boss of Burger King has hinted that one in 10 of its outlets could close, costing 1,600 jobs.US companies are also struggling, with Harley-Davidson announcing 700 job cuts....and new data showing that more than 1.3 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment support last week.As if Covid-19 wasn’t trouble enough, British companies have been warned to expect new barriers selling their products in the European Union.UK nationals will also face “thorough checks” when travelling to the continent even if there is a Brexit trade deal, the European commission has said.In a document warning businesses to prepare for the end of the Brexit transition period, the EU executive said many changes were “inevitable” even if the two sides reached an agreement by the end of the year.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier released the document, after three days of talks with his counterpart David Frost in London, where he said “significant ergences” remained between the two sides.The 35-page document contained a thinly-veiled criticism of the UK government’s decision not to opt for a one or two-year extension of the Brexit transition period. The choices made by the United Kingdom’s government on the future relationship and on not extending the transition period mean that these inevitable disruptions will occur as of 1 January 2021 and risk compounding the pressure that businesses are already under due to the COVID-19 outbreak.It also underscores that Brussels has no intention of phasing in border controls, an approach favoured by the British government. From 1 January 2021, customs officers in EU member states are expected to carry out full controls, which are “likely to lead to increased administrative burdens for businesses and longer delivery times in logistical supply chains,” the commission said. These controls will apply even if the EU and UK are successful in agreeing a trade deal that sets tariffs at zero, with no limits on quantities of exports and imports.As Barnier has long trailed, British financial firms in the City of London will lose the “passports” that allow them to sell services in the rest of the union.Travellers will no longer be assured protection under EU passenger rights law that guarantees some compensation, nor will they have sure access to reduced roaming rates, while cats, dogs and other domestic animals will be stripped of the EU pet passport. Anxiety over the economic pain of the Covid-19 pandemic is also hitting global stock markets.Traders are pointing to the latest surge in Covid-19 cases in America:Travel companies and retailers, who suffer badly from lockdowns and physical distancing restrictions are among the fallers.Even Harley-Davidson can’t escape the shadow of job cuts.Company share prices have a nasty habit of rising when job cuts are announced - but not today.CNN says the problems in the UK have highlighted the economic cost of the pandemic:In another blow, hundreds of jobs are being cut at Wales’s Celtic Manor.The Newport-based company, which hosted golf’s Ryder Cup in 2010 and the 2014 Nato Conference, told staff today that around 450 of its 995 posts are to be made redundant. “It is clear the Covid-19 crisis will continue to have a catastrophic effect on the global economy, our nation and the travel, tourism and events industries for many months to come, and the Celtic Collection must reshape and resize its business to ensure that it is fit for the future.“With drastically reduced occupancies and revenues, its current financial model is not sustainable.“Staff whose positions are at risk of redundancy have been sent letters advising them of the process.”As well as one of the UK’s top hotels, the Celtic Manor Resort includes an international conference centre, and several golf courses. It was built by Welsh-Canadian business magnate Sir Terry Matthews, who built his fortune though telecoms and has ploughed a lot of it into the Newport site. Plaid Cymru Senedd Member for South Wales East Delyth Jewell has called on Matthews to use his “amble means” to keep all staff employed until the economy has recovered.The site shut down in the pandemic, but is due to reopen next week.Lucy Powell MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers, says retailers such as John Lewis and Boots need more targeted support from the government:“This is deeply worrying news for staff at John Lewis and Boots and the travel hubs and town centres these stores are in. These announcements underline the dangers facing our high street, as many businesses struggle to survive through the Covid-19 crisis and the necessary public health measures which limit capacity and demand. “The Chancellor’s statement was a missed opportunity to protect jobs with properly targeted support for the businesses and people that need it. “Ministers must acknowledge that different parts of our economy face very different challenges in the months ahead and come forward with a real plan to protect jobs in sectors fully closed or only partially reopened, and develop an urgent programme to boost retailers and save our high streets from becoming ghost towns.”West Midlands mayor Andy Street, the former managing director of John Lewis, says the company is wrong to shut the Birmingham department store (which he opened five years ago).Street says John Lewis’s failure to make a success of the store is “extremely disappointing”. He believes it can still be a success, and has pledged to make the case for keeping the store open, saying:At this stage the closure is only a proposal, and one I believe risks being a terrible mistake. Therefore I will be making the case for why the company should not give up this tremendous opportunity in Birmingham.However, John Lewis said this morning that the eight stores being shut were all struggling before the Covid-19 pandemic, so it may not see the same opportunity as Street....Boris Johnson’s spokesman has told journalists in Westminster that the government will help John Lewis and Boots workers “in any way we can”.But... chancellor Rishi Sunak’s new £30bn mini-budget package is already meant to be providing support. Those measures, including a £1,000 bonus for taking back furloughed staff, didn’t prompt a last-minute change of heart at either company.Labour MP Bill Esterson points out that manufacturing is also struggling.As covered earlier, 2,000 Rolls-Royce staff are expected to take voluntary redundancy or early retirement by August, following the slump in air travel.The scale of the job cuts being imposed at Boots and John Lewis shows that Covid-19 is still battering the UK high street, says the FT’s John Eley:John Lewis’s decision to shut two full-size department stores in large centres — the Intu complex in Watford and the Grand Central development above Birmingham’s New Street station — is likely to send shockwaves through the retail industry.The 136,000 square foot Birmingham store opened in 2015 as part of an ambitious redevelopment of the city centre.While most of Boots’ stores remained open during the UK’s 12-week lockdown, the company still reported much lower shopper numbers and refused to pay rent to many of its larger landlords while it renegotiated lease terms. More than 100 of its larger stores in city centre, station and airport locations were closed, along with most of the Boots Opticians practices, while beauty and fragrance counters, which are major revenue drivers, were unable to operate.

After all, this nation trafficked more enslaved Africans than almost any other – at least 3 million on British ships – yet it has only ever expressed “regret”. It’s a strange choice of words for playing a leading role in the greatest atrocity in human history.The minister explained to me that the UK cannot apologise, because the case against it – watertight in moral and ethical terms – might then become legal too. In short, Britain won’t use the language of apology, out of fear this might pave the way for reparations.That admission made me sit up and take notice. Because, passionate as I have always been about racial justice, I’m also not immune from the perception of reparations as – in the words of American writer Isabel Wilkerson – especially “radioactive”.Yet I’m now seeing with increasing clarity how this perception only serves to reinforce systems of race and power. The debate about reparations has, conveniently, been branded extreme and unrealistic by those who don’t want to pay them. We happily listen to the heir to the throne – who on Windrush Day said Britain owed a “debt of gratitude” to the people of the Caribbean – while ignoring the reality that what Britain owes is, in fact, a straight-up financial debt.The case is unequivocal. The African American intellectual WEB Du Bois was right when he described the enslavement of at least 12 million Africans as “the sum of all villainies, the cause of all sorrow, the root of all prejudice”. In the Caribbean, Britain received, in the words of Nobel prize-winning economist Arthur Lewis, 200 years of free labour – from over 15 million black people, and those who were indentured from India. The conditions in the Caribbean were so bad that, during the second world war, Britain tried to prevent deployment of African Americans on military bases in the islands. Whitehall feared the sight of better-off black Americans might wake its colonial subjects out of the ignorance of their condition on which British exploitation depended. The Caribbean’s “pandemic of chronic diseases” – as historian Hilary Beckles, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies, has termed it – can be directly traced to British slavery and colonial practice. It is now a global hypertension hotspot. The high diabetes rate has left two of Britain’s former colonies, Barbados and Jamaica, vying for the dubious honour of being the per capita amputation capital of the world. “For 300 years the people of this region were forced to consume a diet based on what we produced, sugar,” Beckles explains. Beckles was speaking this week as the Caribbean Community (Caricom) demanded reparations for Native genocide and African enslavement from 10 European nations, including the UK. It’s not a fringe set of demands but the formal position of Britain’s former colonies in the region, now its Commonwealth “friends”, including Jamaica, Guyana and Barbados – whose prime minister, Mia Mottley, is a committed advocate of reparations.These demands are not about money per se. To borrow the language of postwar Jewish reparatory justice claims, which rightly run into the billions, it’s about the “mass murder, the human suffering, the annihilation of spiritual, intellectual, and creative forces, which are without parallel in the history of mankind”.In fact, reparations speak a language of apology that western nations should understand. They have been profoundly comfortable receiving them.In the US, the Confederates who lost the civil war received compensation for the loss of their property. France had no issue extorting huge sums from Haiti for generations, as reparations for that nation’s audacity in overthrowing slavery in 1804. This arrangement, euphemistically designed to “indemnify” French colonialists, persisted until 1947.The pattern is clear. Reparations have been paid to those who profited from African enslavement, rather than those who were enslaved. As the historian Ana Lucia Araujo has written, to this day no former slave society in the Americas, no former slaves or their descendants, and no African nation, has ever obtained any form of reparations for the Atlantic slave trade.Some would argue that, with the slavery era having ended so long ago, it’s now too late. But this is a piece of circularity par excellence. During the time of enslavement, and unceasingly since the 18th century, black people have stated the case in petitions, correspondences, pamphlets, public speeches, slave narratives and judicial claims – advocating in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese.As the French colonial writer Prince Marc Kojo Tovalou Houénou wrote of Benin, black people “cry ‘Reparations!’ without ceasing”. That this cry was deliberately ignored for so long in the past cannot logically form the basis of a denial in the present.The language of reparations continually evolves. Recently, it has taken the form of Beyoncé’s Black Parade (“Need peace and reparation for my people”) Belgians’ resurgent condemnation of the brutalisation, rape, exploitation and deaths of 5 million Congolese during colonial rule and Ta-Nehisi Coates’ powerful testimony before the US House of Representatives that, if the US wants to say D-day matters, then so does the 1921 “Black Wall Street” race massacre. Human Rights Watch has launched a formal investigation into that atrocity, which saw an organised white mob, armed by city officials, destroy a successful black economic hub in Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing hundreds.The case for reparations is becoming a global conversation to which every nation that systematically enriched itself by stealing black people’s very humanity – not to mention unquantifiable torture and cultural destruction – now finds itself exposed.Instead of going away, these reparatory justice movements will continue to reinforce each other across the black diaspora. As Beckles puts it, there’s no carpet in the world with enough space under it for this legacy to be swept away. will celebrate world-shaping iniduals and momentous events of Black History with our six-part series of wallcharts.

MPs and civil society must take the initiativeOn Wednesday the World Health Organization appointed a committee of inquiry, to be led by the former New Zealand prime minister, Helen Clark, and the ex-president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to evaluate the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. They will produce an interim report in November and a full report in May 2021. For all its limitations, largely imposed by China, the inquiry is a highly important initiative. The pandemic is unrelenting and accelerating. If it is written with independence and authority, the report should help to produce a better model of international and national response to future waves of Covid-19 and to other pandemics.Boris Johnson was rightly a supporter of an early and independent WHO inquiry. This stands in marked contrast to his cautious and evasive views on a possible inquiry into Britain’s own response. From early in the Covid-19 lockdown, there have been many calls for an inquiry here. Mr Johnson has made vaguely sympathetic noises, but he has never committed himself explicitly to the kind of inquiry that is needed. On 23 June, for example, the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey, who has led many of the calls, asked in the Commons whether the prime minister would set up an independent inquiry. Mr Johnson responded by saying: “I am sure there will come a moment when lessons need to be learned – indeed we are learning them the whole time – but I do not consider at the moment that a full-scale national inquiry is a good use of official time.”This is now the standard ministerial response. The words deserve scrutiny. It is widely assumed that Mr Johnson is willing eventually to see a proper inquiry established into Britain’s handling of coronavirus. But this is naive. There is nothing in any words of his to support that view. Mr Johnson says he is in favour of learning lessons, which is not the same thing as establishing an inquiry, and he says they are already being learned. He says now is not the time, but he never gives any hint about what time would be better. The conclusion from all this can best be summed up this way: inquiry? What inquiry?It is easy to see why Mr Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings might not want an inquiry. Britain’s handling of Covid-19 has been a litany of failures. No country in Europe has had so many coronavirus cases, or anything like as many deaths as Britain. Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings dominate this highly centralised government. Any serious inquiry into Britain’s response could hardly fail to find much for which they should be held to account. The idea that a Downing Street regime that loathes judges, ex-ministers and senior civil servants might put one of them in charge of such an explosive inquiry is for the birds.It is time to stop accepting Mr Johnson’s prevarications. There is no good case for delay. Sweden, which has also made serious mistakes in its handling of the pandemic, set up an independent inquiry at the end of June, with politicians excluded. Its inquiry will produce an early report on care homes, followed by an interim report in the spring and a final report in 2022. France, another country that has already set up an inquiry, has established a parliamentary commission with wide powers. There is absolutely no reason for Britain not to follow suit. If government will not act, civil society must do so.First, there should be a rapid, independent and transparent review of what has worked and not worked in Britain so far in order to equip us against a second coronavirus wave. Second, parliamentarians should establish a special select committee on the pandemic with powers to summon witnesses and documents. Finally, there should be a formal inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act, which must report by the middle of 2023, well before the next general election. None of this is going to happen without serious pressure from civil society and MPs. Parliament is just two weeks away from its summer recess. But these weeks are crucial if Mr Johnson’s deliberate delaying tactics are to be stopped, as they must be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c25f5a33071c0caf9bbb0b055aafcd828f58a51/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4370ef5beaee6df8a789dea82454ddfe","title":"boohoo shares bounce back after pledge to improve factory conditions","story":"Fashion retailer lost almost £2bn value after revelations about Leicester suppliersNews that agencies including the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority had not found evidence of modern slavery in the Leicester garment factories was followed by supportive notes from analysts at influential firms including HSBC, Peel Hunt and Société Générale.Anne Critchlow, an analyst at SG, wrote: “We view the recent share price fall as a buying opportunity and consider this week’s supply chainlow-pay controversy to be an isolated incident. We are also reassured to see Boohoo taking strong action to limit the risk of future controversies.”The rebound came after almost £2bn was wiped off the value of the company in three days following allegations that UK factories supplying the company, which owns a string of brands including Nasty Gal and Pretty Little Thing, paid workers below the minimum wage and failed to protect them from the coronavirus outbreak.Analysts said Boohoo’s shares had largely been pushed up by small-scale investors taking advantage of the steep slide in the fashion chain’s share price to make an investment.The price of shares was also bolstered as hedge funds, including PSquared Asset Management, which had taken short positions – a bet against a company’s share price – closed their positions after benefiting from three days of sharp falls in Boohoo’s shares.John Stevenson, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said there was a recognition that the share price had dropped too far, given that Boohoo had made a serious pledge to tackle the problems in Leicester. He said that the group’s sales could take a hit, particularly if some key online influencers decided to step back from promoting Boohoo’s brands in the light of the revelations, but the effect would not be enough to justify the dramatic fall in its share price since Friday.“People have seen it has gone too far,” he said. He added that investors had also seen that Boohoo was “clearly stepping up to the plate” with a package of measures to improve conditions in Leicester."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f170163e2fb3f088bf2f460fffa5d050a7e5e21/0_45_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b4405c3527f5b50f5f515851fde8c6","title":"seven ways to help garment workers","story":"The Covid-19 pandemic has shone a light on the exploitation of those – mainly women – who produce fast fashion for well-known brands. From donating to emergency funds to slowing the churn, retailers must be held to accountThe Covid-19 pandemic has created fresh injustices. Throughout lockdown, garment workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam have faced destitution and starvation as big-name fashion retailers have cancelled £20bn in orders. “A lot of these fast fashion companies have pulled contracts where fabric has been ordered, received, cut and sewn,” said Raakhi Shah, CEO of the Circle, at an emergency panel the not-for-proft organisation held this week on fast fashion and slavery. “The brands haven’t fulfilled their side of the agreement. And these thousands of garment workers have been left destitute.”In Leicester, where exploitation has been known about for years, the context of the coronavirus has refocused attention on garment workers – forced to work throughout lockdown, despite high levels of infection.It is easy to feel helpless but, says Shah: “There are lots of ways that you can make a difference around this.”Speaking of whether change is possible to what, at times, seems an intractable problem, the Circle’s founder, Annie Lennox (formerly the Eurythmics frontwoman), dialling in from Los Angeles, said: “It’s like climbing a mountain, it’s not going to be overnight, but it is possible.”Some things, such as donating to funds for garment workers facing destitution, can make an immediate difference. Others involve collective action and require longer term, structural change.“Expecting factories to foot this bill when factories don’t necessarily have any accumulated wealth is outrageous,” says Siegle.The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) has created a tracker to show which brands have paid in full and which haven’t. “It gets its intelligence from factories and workers,” says Siegle, and is a good way to put pressure on those companies that have yet to pay up. Primark, for instance, according to WRC, “pledged to pay for about $460m in orders it had previously cancelled”, but “did not, however, disclose what percentage of its total unpaid commitments this figure represents”. C\u0026ampA, which reinstated some orders after initially cancelling them, is delaying delivery and payment “for as long as a year on some of the orders it has nominally reinstated”.Inidual action needs to feed into structural reform, says Siegle, who suggests people should join Labour Behind the Label or support the Clean Clothes Campaign. She also advises emailing brands to call on them to pay up.Just £20 buys a food parcel and they have already managed to help thousands of families. While Shah calls the Circle’s emergency fund a “sticking plaster in the short term”, it is vital, given that, without it, many garment workers might have faced starvation.Time and again fast fashion brands defend their actions by saying “it’s what the consumer wants”. Shah says those with purchasing power should “be at the forefront now”.One way to disrupt the system is by voting with your wallet. Speaking at the panel, Livia Firth, the founder of Eco-Age, says consumers’ actions can send a strong message. “Only by slowing down will we send a very strong signal that we are not going on like we have for the last 20 years. Let’s show them that the consumer doesn’t want it.”She says people need to be more informed: “If you usually spend a portion of your day on social media looking at clothes on Pretty Little Thing or Boohoo, could you devote some of that time to reading the Clean Clothes campaign liveblog and might that cause a liberation and cognitive shift?”“The long-term work needs to be on structural reform and holding these brands and retailers to account,” says Siegle.Referring to Leicester, she says: “These are illegal working practices and you have a right to contact your MP and call for a transparent inquiry into working practices around fast fashion companies.”Simor’s concern now is that “criminal proceedings follow – holding those responsible who should be held responsible”. She is concerned that the victims will be further victimised and we will end up with “the victims suffering more because it is quite possible that a number of them were here unlawfully, were trafficked or were asylum seekers”. It is important, she says, that we “keep an eye on this story”.What has happened in Leicester is shocking, and there are hopes that the reaction to the exploitation of workers there may have some positive knock-on effects for how we react to abuses of those working in the garment industry around the world.“It’s always a bit shocking when this race to the bottom happens in our context,” says Firth. “We always consider the lives of people close to us more precious than the lives of those in far away countries.”As Siegle puts it: “Even out your response to it.” It might sound obvious, but it’s about having the same outrage for what is happening to those making clothes for fast fashion in Cambodia or Pakistan as those in Leicester.Simor wants us to take note of the use by Priti Patel of the word “slavery” in reference to exploitation in Leicester. It is “extremely important”, she says, “that the home secretary has used the word ‘slavery’ about these practices. If the home secretary is willing to recognise this as slavery in Leicester, then the question arises as to how this can be acceptable anywhere in the world? That’s something that has to be challenged and we have to take ministers on.”Obviously, UK laws apply in Leicester, but in other countries where garments are being produced for consumers in the west, the UK has no jurisdiction. But, says Simor: “We need corporate responsibility to extend to where products are made. We have to somehow come up with some kind of controls within our jurisdiction that have an impact on those other jurisdictions.”She cites cases of the EU legislating for “actions and inactions outside of the EU”, such as those involving conflict diamonds, data breaches, bribery and even the food supply chain.“Most of those areas are simply concerned with money or data and what we’re saying is there’s no reason you can’t extend those ideas and principles to human beings,” she says. While she is working on a project to “develop law that takes some of the ideas from those bits of legislation and apply them to wage laws”, EU law isn’t necessarily something iniduals can have an impact on.What inidual action needs to do, says Siegle, is “feed into structural reform – it’s the same as climate.” For starters, we can be more aware: “It’s great if someone wants to inform themselves – and if they want to become a barrister, that would be great!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d12233cbb70114f9b09feae55664a9c99fd180aa/0_204_4046_2429/master/4046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62d9545bd71164a385079bebd4950c21","title":"charlize theron 20 best film roles ranked","story":"As her new film hits Netflix, here’s a run down of the actor’s greatest performances, from sci-fi action and comedy to the portrayal of a serial killerIn this disturbing story of a father and son making their way across a post-apocalyptic America, Charlize Theron appears in flashback as the boy’s mother. Theron is a potent image of paradise lost, although it appears she has deserted her husband and child, intriguingly clouding her moral status.This fairy tale reboot has the interesting and witty casting of Theron as the Evil Queen, consumed with jealousy of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) – although it is the ice-blonde Theron who more deserves the title of Snow White. She is terrified of losing her beauty and like the fabled “Blood Countess”, Elizabeth Báthory, uses virgins’ blood to replenish it.An essentially decorative role for Theron in this madly convoluted noir from John Frankenheimer. Theron plays Ashley, a woman who has been having a romantic penpal relationship with a convict who is killed in a knife-fight just before his release. His cellmate Rudy (Ben Affleck), released at the same time, sees the lovely Ashley and passes himself off as her epistolary lover. Soon they are having non-epistolary sex, but then Rudy gets mixed up with a criminal plan dreamed up by Ashley’s brother.In this deeply strange film by Lasse Hallström, Theron plays Candy, a young woman who arrives with her boyfriend, Wally (Paul Rudd), at a prewar orphanage run by Dr Larch (Michael Caine), who secretly offers abortions. Larch’s young protege, Homer (Tobey Maguire), befriends them, goes with them to Rudd’s family farm and falls deeply in love with Candy while Wally is away fighting in the second world war. They go for soulful walks on the beach and Homer intuits that Candy has profound emotional trauma. Theron does her best in this odd, muddled film.With her striking asymmetrical black hairstyle, Theron presents here the action-movie mode that has become an important part of her screen persona. It hardly needs saying, but she is almost scarily beautiful and, with its interesting martial arts stylings, this is an underrated sci-fi action flick.Theron is the leader of an elite warrior crew who are all immortal, condemned to fight for justice as the centuries roll by. A return to her asymmetrical black hair mode, which she still carries off with great hauteur and charisma, although it is a pity this action movie doesn’t do her justice. This was a labour of love for Theron, who has a producer’s credit. She plays the feckless single mother of a little kid, who runs off with a truck driver leaving her daughter with her brother, played by Nick Stahl, who does his best to look after her. Theron is a fleeting presence, and many felt she should have awarded herself more screentime.Theron plays Mary, whose husband, Ray (Jason Bateman), has his life saved by the chaotic, ridiculous Hancock. He’s a wacky anti-superhero, played by Will Smith, whose exploits are widely resented, as they cause more problems than they solve. Mary is herself no stranger to superpowers, though she has opted for a quieter, non-superhero life. This subdued role is perhaps symptomatic of the way Theron and maybe all female stars get treated in Hollywood.This strained, contorted but intermittently powerful film about the Fox News TV sex-abuse scandal is compromised by its inability to decide if Fox staffers can be shown sympathetically. But Theron gives an interesting, if mannered performance as Megyn Kelly, the Fox News presenter who challenges Trump on his misogynist attitudes.Theron co-starred here with her then partner, the Irish actor Stuart Townsend, in this outrageously silly but entertaining period melodrama. She’s a Zuleika Dobson-type femme fatale at Oxford in the 1930s who has an affair with Townsend’s smitten student, who is then to be the intimate witness of her wartime adventures as the lover of a beautiful model, played by Penélope Cruz, and then the apparent mistress (or maybe spy) on the arm of a top Nazi. Goofy stuff, but there’s a lot here for Theron to do, and she has fun with the role.This remake of the 1949 family favourite gives Theron her Fay Wray moment. She plays Jill, a naturalist who has been caring for Joe, a giant, sweet-natured 15ft gorilla. She is persuaded to bring Joe out of his Ugandan habitat to Los Angeles where a wildlife conservancy will apparently foot the bills – but an evil poacher is ready to pounce. There are lots of high-spirited adventures for Joe with Jill often in his (chaste) embrace.James Gray’s tough, dour, impassioned drama about crime and municipal corruption stars Mark Wahlberg as Leo, out of jail and heartbreakingly determined to go straight, who winds up working on the railway yards, where working practices are crooked. Theron plays his cousin Erica, dating Willie (Joaquin Phoenix), the guy Leo saved from prison by not snitching. Erica represents a kind of beautiful prospect of freedom, the life Leo hasn’t had while in prison and may never have.Theron brings some serious martial arts chops to this action spy thriller set in 80s East Berlin. She will sashay through some neon-lit nightclub and accept with a knowing smile a Stoli on the rocks and some badinage from the barman, before putting the smackdown on some brutish thug. It may all be a bit silly, but Theron has some amazingly good one-on-one combat scenes and extended punchups where she shows that she is an authentic action star.It is always good to see Theron playing an authority figure, and in Ridley Scott’s hi-tech prequel to Alien she plays Meredith Vickers, the gorgeously icy, black jumpsuit-clad corporate figure whose shadowy company is bankrolling an intergalactic expedition that may discover the origins of human existence. The ship is called Prometheus, and Vickers is aboard as the official representative with a frosty habit of treating everyone as an inferior. Theron is the ice cube that keeps the drink cool.Diablo Cody wrote this intriguing and elegant satire on the terrible tolls of marriage and motherhood, directed by Jason Reitman. Theron plays Marlo, a careworn woman on the verge of breakdown due to sleeplessness caused by a young baby. Her wealthy brother hires a “night nanny” for her (Mackenzie Davis) and this impossibly slim, pretty, lithe young woman is superb with the baby. Marlo is obsessed with her carefree youth and health (things that she can remember having) and her burgeoning closeness with the nanny takes her to some very dark places. Theron boldly shows how her character, having already deteriorated, can spin further down.This excellent drama shows that Theron can rise to the occasion when she is paired with a strong co-star. That’s certainly what she gets with Tommy Lee Jones, who plays a retired military police inspector. He’s trying to discover the truth about the mysterious death of his son, a serving soldier, whose body was discovered in scrubland near his military base in New Mexico. Also on the case is a civilian cop, played by Theron, a lonely single mum who has been humiliated after a calamitious affair with her married boss. These two unhappy souls come together in the cause of justice, and achieve a quasi-father-daughter friendship. Strong, empathetic performance from Theron.Why hasn’t Theron done more comedy? This is great stuff from her, playing Charlotte, a dazzlingly glamorous and brilliant politician who is a presidential hopeful. Seth Rogen plays Fred, a schlubby, beardy loser of a journalist whom Charlotte once babysat when he was a tiny kid. Now she decides to employ him as her speechwriter because he’s one of the very few men around whom she can relax. Poor Fred soon falls deeply in love with her, and who knows if it isn’t reciprocated? A tender, smart, beguiling performance from Theron.Theron created an instant icon in George Miller’s crazy, operatically over-the-top action-chase thriller fantasia set in the post-apocalyptic desert, a 21st-century update of his Mad Max classic. Tom Hardy plays Max, fighting against the tyrannical warlord chieftain Immortan Joe. On his side is the dazzling Imperator Furiosa, the one-armed badass played with glittery-eyed panache by Theron, whose job is to lead raids, stealing gasoline, ammunition and other necessities. Furiosa always looks as if she has just walked away from (and perhaps caused) an explosion that has made her slightly smudgy-faced and yet is always very glamorous and stylish.Theron gave the world an absolute barnstorming and indeed Oscar-winning performance in this gruesome true-crime movie, “uglied up” to play the serial killer Aileen Wuornos, who was executed for seven murders just one year before this film came out. Theron had clearly studied the real-life Wuornos from the two documentaries about her by Nick Broomfield and created an eerily clever, chilling impersonation of a young woman who had been forced by poverty into sex work and found that her talent was in killing her male clients. Theron’s brown contact lenses create the glassily reptilian belligerent stare, and the flaky dull skin is fabricated with prosthetics. But makeup is only a fraction of what Theron does with this role, showing, through Wuornos’s tense, clenched body language, the reality that her whole life has been a fight she is destined one day to lose.This wasn’t Theron’s Oscar-prestige movie, but it is her best: the most subtle, evolved, persuasively horrible and funniest performance she has ever given, in a black comedy written by Cody and directed by Reitman. She plays the unspeakable Mavis Gary, a jaded former prom queen for whom high school was clearly the most important time of her life, and who now writes generic young-adult fiction, eavesdropping on teen conversations in malls to put into her books, and compulsively rewriting her own tales of teen triumph. She is a functioning alcoholic and depressive, heading for some kind of breakdown, which arrives when she chances upon a round-robin email from her old boyfriend, who attaches a picture of his heartrendingly lovely new baby.Mavis is electrified with a new project: she will return to her hometown, with all its pathetic contemptible losers, and break up her ex’s marriage – because they are clearly fated to be together. Theron makes a superb sociopath, even scarier than in Monster, because of her incomplete touch of satirical self-knowledge and also, I think, because of the seductively husky low voice. She also has a kind of “loser” non-romance with Patton Oswalt, not unlike the one she has with Seth Rogen in Long Shot, but this has far more edge. There is something very evil about her Mavis, something magnificently unsympathetic. Not every heroine has to be relatable.

After four months of being starved of the big-screen experience, four months of sitting at my desk watching films on my MacBook, four months of enduring a cowed miniaturisation of the cinema experience, four months of spilling mugs of tea over the keyboard and grumpily reloading the web link only to find the wifi has gone down and I’ve got the spinning wheel of death … I have the chance to see a film at the proper scale – at one of the new drive-in movie events that are popping up all over the country. And your car provides a natural bubble for social distancing.This one, held by the Drive In Film Club, was at Alexandra Palace in London, in the car park next to the ice rink, which usually hosts a slightly low-morale funfair in summer. I went on to the website and booked a ticket for the Pixar classic The Incredibles. The thing is, I’ve never been to a drive-in before. Even when I was in my 20s, these impossibly glamorous US events were becoming rare. I associate them with hot summer nights, John Travolta with his arm around Olivia Newton-John in his cool roadster, a little speaker hooked over the driver-side window, and young people in shorts rollerskating up to the car with hot dogs and Coca-Cola.This isn’t exactly the vibe on a cloudy afternoon in London, where traffic marshals in hi-vis yellow tabards sternly direct cars to the correct entrance with windmilling arm movements. Still, I’m ready for the little speaker to be hooked to the side of the car so I can hear what’s being said on the screen. Someone in a hi-vis tabard leans over as we roll in: “To get the audio, tune to 87.7 on your FM dial.”Wait! What? The radio appears to be entirely presets. I panic and frantically twiddle the dial past Magic FM, Classic FM, Radio 2, Radio 4, Classic FM again and back to Magic FM, while huge faces on the screen in front mouth all-but wordlessly. I fear this is going to be a silent movie performance accompanied by the sound of Carolyn Quinn on the PM programme. Then, sound and vision magically link up, just as – gloriously – the Pearl \u0026amp Dean ads begin.I had forgotten how much I’d missed this: not just the big screen, but the sound. With the windows open, it reverberates from car to car and a bank of speakers at the front creates the “house” effect of sound emanating from the screen. I’d missed the echo and the communal boom of the cinema. Obviously, the sound is not the same inside your car and, looking around at all the other vehicles, it is easy to think you could be at a car boot sale.But it is still liberating and I quietly squeak with excitement as I select a Diet Coke and a giant pack of Maltesers from the snack delivery system accessed from a website on my smartphone, paid for online and delivered to my car within 10 minutes by a rollerskater in a mask. (Any problems with that, or anything else, and the protocol is to flash your hazard lights and not sound your horn and distract from the film.)As well as the ads, an announcement reel is played that appears to be the genuine article from US drive-ins from the 50s and 60s. It tells “mom and pop” to go with their kids if they need to leave the car for any reason. This was a real homage to the “authentic” Eisenhower-era drive-in.As for The Incredibles, it is as brilliant as I had remembered – and this is the first time I have seen it on the big screen since it came out in 2004 and blew me away. What a treat.So why can’t drive-ins be a habit that we pick up from the lockdown? And if getting new films shown in this way is a problem, then why not reinvent the drive-in as the new frontier for cinephilia and make these events a showcase for classic movies, foreign movies, or little-known gems? Why not exploit empty spaces such as car parks like this all the time? As the Beach Boys put it: “Forget about the plot, it’ll do very well  But make sure you see enough so you’re prepared to tell  About the drive in  I love the drive in …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e944701a91f913242f9185878562f7e37d181e63/0_179_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a60ab7281184e7bb2a49d6b3164dbb15","title":"bournemouth v tottenham hotspur premier league live","story":"89 mins: There could be more than 10 minutes of injury time. Actually, there should be around 12 or 13, I reckon. Especially now Aurier is down injured after falling badly at the byline and hurting his already bandaged wrist. 87 mins: Gosling also goes into the book for a hilarious hacking down of Lamela. 85 mins: Bournemouth are upset after the referee blows up very late for a dreadful foul by Ndombele on Callum Wilson. Their anger was due to the fact that Stanislas sprinted away and chipped the ball into the box for King to nod in. Sadly, for all involved, Stanislas was offside. On the upside, Ndombele was cautioned.Peter Oh says: “Re: 49 min. No room in the all-time balloon XI for English greats Valve Ramsey, Paul Gas-coigne or the Dutchman Danny Blimp?”83 mins: Spurs now look very much on top and Bournemouth only have one substitution opening in which to make their final few changes. Could be crucial.Aurier drives a low cross but it is deflected wide. The corner is then cleared out for another, which comes to nothing.81 mins: Aurier has put in around 10 crosses today. Fair play to him. He must be annoyed that no one has got on the end of one with real purpose. “Considering the football on show, what this mbm needs is a 710 Keane anecdote,” says Paul Fitzgerald.79 mins: Another Aurier cross finds Lamela in the box but the Argentine can only flick it onwards and wide. Spurs have finally woken up!77 mins: Moura is on for Spurs, with Sissoko the man replaced. Hopefully that is a positive change.“I have a theory,” says Andrew Pearson. “Jose has been taken on to keep the seat warm while Poch takes a deserved break. I can dream, can’t I?”75 mins: And we are having a drinks break. Plenty of resting in this half.73 mins: This will end 0-0, won’t it?71 mins: Aurier once again gets in down the right and sends in a dangerous low cross into the box but Ake is in the right position to turn it behind. The corner comes to nothing.Wilson earns Bournemouth a corner down the other end by driving to the byline, before getting crowded out. King heads the subsequent corner wide.Stephen Carr (not that one) says: “Levy - a man with such a reputation for squeaking the pips on a deal, yet he sanctioned jizzing £15m a year on Mourinho to produce this beggars belief. Its beyond turgid.” does not condone the use of the word jizzing.69 mins: The two injuries have made the match even slower, which is a feat. 67 mins: Harry Wilson replaces the stricken Brooks. He scored twice in the reverse fixture, which might help.65 mins: Referee Tierney, who has had a poor game, gives Spurs a foul after Ndombele piles into Lerma. Bournemouth clear another Aurier cross, which falls to Winks 30 yards from goal but his volley ends up about 20 yards over the bar.Oh .. and now Brooks is heading off with a calf issue.63 mins: Smith is eventually taken off on a stretcher. Stacey on.59 mins: Smith is still being treated and is yet to be moved to a stretcher. Everyone right to use plenty of caution with an injury like this.57 mins: Smith is to be replaced by Stacey. The right-back got inhumanely clattered by Davies and now needs to be stretchered off. 55 mins: Calls for a penalty by Bournemouth as Wilson goes down under pressure from Vertonghen in the box but the referee is having one of it.Smith gets another whacking from Davies and it looks like the Bournemouth man might be out cold. There are lots of medical staff on to deal with it. 53 mins: A long ball is lumped out towards the right where Aurier jumps with Rico, resulting in a clash of heads. The Spaniard comes off worse but eventually gets up to check his teeth are all intact. Luckily, they are.51 mins: Kane lines up a free-kick 25 yards from goal after Lamela is fouled. The Spurs skipper whacks it into the wall and, more specifically, into the stomach of Adam Smith who is down in agony. That has to hurt.49 mins: Spurs have started the half looking bright, with Ndombele giving off the impression he might not be as bad as Mourinho makes out.Further to Peter Oh’s submission half an hour before kickoff, here is the Official All-Time Balloon XI:Gasper SchmeichelInfleighton BainesHot-airy ButcherAlan BalloonHelium BradyThomas ParteyExpandy TownsendPop RobsonFloathar MatthäusJoezeppelintonGeoff Burst47 mins: There is some early admin for us as Mourinho has taken off Bergwijn and Lo Celso, who barely touched it between them. Ndombele and Son have replaced. Hopefully these changes will make Spurs less awful to watch.Here we go again!Mary Waltz offers: “When Keane walks into a restaurant, do the chefs tremble in fear hoping that their idea of medium rare is the same as his?”I assume so. I worked at ITV Sport for five years and had to interview Keane a couple of times. I can tell you two 710 Keane anecdotes if you ask nicely and send me wine.“Will Unwin,” is the formal opening from Mike Welch.“Thanks much for swinging wide the gate for me to release my irrational inability to fairly judge Erik Lamela’s soccerball skills because of his ridiculous hair. I haven’t closely reviewed the latest, which appears to consist of dollops of some sort of meringue-based bleach pomade. But it’s just the latest in a series of kewpie-doll styles that cannot be excused by youth.“Send me an invoice.”Like Graeme Souness, I judge all footballers based on their hair.Now Keane is laying into how poor Spurs area. I wish I could be as angry as Keane about everything.Keane and Evra are spending half-time pointing out that Spurs should have had a penalty for King’s push on Kane. Evra: “I think the referee should go home in a taxi.” It’s the way you tell ‘em, Pat.Ed Aarons beat me at tennis on Tuesday but I am happy to be the bigger man and promote his work here:Spurs have been frighteningly mediocre, while Bournemouth have looked dangerous without getting close to scoring. Bottom line: not a classic.45 mins: Stanislas works some space for himself on the edge of the box, allowing him to drag a low shot at goal but Lloris reads it and palms it behind. 44 mins: Lamela picks up the ball 30 yards from goal, skips forward a few yards and then lets fly with his wand of a left foot but it goes well over the bar. At least I had hope for a second. 42 mins: Winks passes the ball straight out of play for some reason or other. Not the midfielder’s best work. 40 mins: Lamela, still angered by his choice of hairstyle, slides in to take the ball off Rico but instead gives away a free-kick. He gets the ball, to be fair, but the referee sees it differently. Stanislas whips in the free-kick but it bounces straight to Lloris.38 mins: Some lovely buildup play by Spurs allows Aurier to put in a cross from the right but he hits the first defender. I can understand how people are frustrated with Aurier’s output. The subsequent free-kick is lumped into Ramsdale’s arms.36 mins: Bournemouth have a corner but it is sent over everyone and out for a throw-in. Please, Cherries, make better decisions.Mary Waltz is committed to this MBM: “Watching Everton, my team, tracking Spurs on your MBM. Southampton is dominating my boys,sigh, just nicked a goal after missing a pen.”34 mins: Bournemouth definitely look like they have more intent about their attacking play, while Spurs are going through the motions.

Ings suddenly switches play with a looped cross, and Redmond curls a diagonal shot wide right from the edge of the box. Much more of this and we can officially say that Everton are hanging on.83 min: Ings jigs in from the left but can’t fashion enough space to shoot. Saints are looking the more likely to find that elusive winner.82 min: More Southampton triangles. Everton are sitting deep, refusing to budge.80 min: Saints draw a few pretty triangles in Everton’s final third. Armstrong is at one tip of most of them. The home side hold their shape, though they surely need to do more, especially if they’re to realise Ancelotti’s dream of Europa League football.78 min: Everton meanwhile have reverted back to their first-half selves. They can’t string two passes together at the moment.76 min: Saints are beginning to regain the ascendancy. Their passes are sticking again. But not in the final third: Walker-Peters bursts down the right into an ocean of space, but his low cross is aimless and easily blocked and cleared.74 min: Another Everton change: Bernard comes on for young Gordon.72 min: Both teams fancy winning this. Kean probes down the left and nearly gets past Stephens up the other end, Ings nearly releases Armstrong down the right, but his team-mate slips over at the vital moment. If another goal is coming, good luck predicting who’ll be scoring it.70 min: The game restarts, but not before Saints replace Adams and Romeu with Long and Hojbjerg.68 min: Calvert-Lewin heads a Sigurdsson corner harmlessly over the bar, and that’s his last contribution. He’s replaced by Kean. A good time for the referee to call for isotonic beverages. This time it’s Ralph Hasenhuttl who will welcome the time to regroup.66 min: Pickford, the ball at his feet, either throws Ings a brilliant dummy, or slips and accidentally throws Ings a brilliant dummy. That was close.64 min: The resulting free kick ends with Sidibe threading a shot towards the bottom right that’s easily snaffled by McCarthy. As for Bednarek’s yellow: it wasn’t 100 percent clear that he didn’t get a bit of the ball, at least not on the first few viewings, so perhaps the VAR operative decided that upping the punishment to red would have been pushing their luck a little bit too far.62 min: VAR takes a long look, but there was arguably cover nearby, and Richarlison was arguably running at an angle taking him slightly away from goal, the ball heading that way too. Whatever’s going through the VAR noggin, it’s presumably not a clear-and-obvious mistake, so the decision stands.60 min: Richarlison pounces on a loose Ward-Prowse pass and races towards the Saints box down the middle. As he reaches the D, Bednarek slides in and clips him over. A free kick, but only a yellow card. Richarlison is livid, he wants his opponent sent off.59 min: But it’s Saints who nearly carve out the next chance, Redmond slipping a clever ball down the inside-right flank for Ings, who momentarily looks to have a yard on Keane. But just as he prepares to shoot, Keane sticks out a toe to deny him. Out for a corner, which leads to nothing.58 min: Everton are much improved in this second half, though it’s been a low bar to clear. They’re asking Saints a few questions now.56 min: Davies passes long down the inside-left channel. The ball drops to Calvert-Lewin, who should work McCarthy at the very least, but takes a fresh-air swipe. The ball clanks onto his hip and away, and Saints are able to clear. That’s poor. Such a fine pass from Davies, all for nowt.55 min: Bednarek and Ings try to recreate, frame by frame, the Digne-Richarlison combination for the Everton goal. Not quite, the pass cut out by Keane at the very last minute.53 min: Sigurdsson yanks a long shot wide right. A poor end to a slightly better period of play by Everton, Richarlison making a proper nuisance of himself right along the line.49 min: Ings flicks the ball on at the near post. There follows one of the most ridiculous periods of play in the entire history of top-flight football stretching back to 1888, a playground scramble with Ings at the centre of the junior-school stramash. A genuine comic-book cloud with boots sticking out of it, plus the words OOF, OOYAH, WAH and GAH displayed at jaunty angles. It ends after 20 seconds or so of pinball nonsense, with Ward-Prowse blootering a shot goalwards. The second corner is dealt with by Everton in a more grown-up style.48 min: Ward-Prowse takes, looking to curl over the wall and into the top right. The ball pings off the top of Sigurdsson’s head and out for a corner. Another Ward-Prowse delivery coming up.47 min: Armstrong dribbles with purpose down the inside right. He circumvents Keane with great ease, forcing the defender to clumsily shove him to ground, just to the right of the D. This is Ward-Prowse Country.46 min: Ings immediately flicks adroitly down the inside-left channel for Adams, who curls towards the top right. It’s an easy enough parry for Pickford, but once again Everton were carved open easily, and what a delicious back-heel that was by the magnificent Ings. One of the players of the season, no question.Saints get the second half underway. Everton have made one half-time change: Sidibe is on for Iwobi.Half-time entertainment. For your listening leisure and pleasure ...Saints have been embarrassingly superior ... but a moment of combined brilliance by Digne and Richarlison means Everton can regroup on level terms. It’s been a lot of fun.45 min +5: Now Mina is down, having taken an elbow in the neck from Redmond. It’s just as well we’re nearing the break, because this is threatening to turn into the Battle of Santiago.45 min +3: Digne hooks into the Saints box from the left. McCarthy punches clear with purpose. Redmond threatens to counter down the left, but Bednarek is down with a sore noggin so the ref stops the game. Redmond isn’t particularly happy about the decision.45 min +2: Two of the four added minutes are used up treating Adams, who is eventually good to go again.45 min: It all kicks off as Richarlison slides recklessly through the back of Adams. It’s a yellow card all day long, but Richarlison is beside himself with anger, and a few shoves later there’s a gentle melee brewing away. Eventually it dies down, though Calvert-Lewin has earned a booking too, for his part in the brouhaha.Out of nothing, Everton are level! Digne, tight on the left touchline near halfway, swings a glorious crossfield pass to Richarlison, making his way down the inside-right channel. Richarlison takes a touch to bring the ball down, then flicks it powerfully towards the top right. McCarthy gets a weak hand to it, but can’t stop it. Ancelotti springs from the bench to celebrate, more out of relief than anything else.43 min: Walker-Peters races down the right. He’s barged over - legally - by Digne, but springs up immediately like Denis Law in his prime. He nips the ball back to Armstrong, whose quick cross is flick-headed over by Adams.42 min: Gomes is down, having taken a knock to his ankle. He’ll not be able to continue, the physio performing the internationally recognised hand-jive for ‘send on the sub’. On comes Sigurdsson, who has been misfiring woefully of late.40 min: Richarlison skitters down the left but is forced to turn tail by Stephens, sticking to him excellently given he’s on a yellow card. But Ward-Prowse comes in clumsily to needlessly flip the Everton striker over. He’s fortunate not to get booked himself. Gordon takes the resulting free kick, Iwobi heading harmlessly over from 12 yards.38 min: Saints stroke it around the back for a bit. Everton are chasing shadows right now. On the touchline, Carlo Ancelotti has the good grace to look extremely concerned.36 min: Ings is now on 19 goals for the season, level with Mohamed Salah in third place in the race for the Golden Boot. He’s three behind the leader Jamie Vardy, and one behind Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.34 min: Stephens clatters his studs high into Richarlison. He’ll be booked for that when play stops, but play goes on as Gordon races towards the Saints box. Walker-Peters comes across to shoulder-charge Gordon off the ball. Goal kick. Everton want a penalty, and there was certainly contact, but the referee isn’t interested. Nor is VAR. Strange, because that didn’t look like a particularly clean challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205d58d33a1083438c3abf603b13a77844002d44/0_375_4264_2559/master/4264.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e0712fc4aa1e958bc0b2699bd6ab6668","title":"gym england reopening date coronavirus expected imminently","story":"Indoor facilities to open from 25 July with new guidance on spacing and cleaning equipmentGyms, swimming pools and leisure centres will reopen in England within days as part of the government’s lockdown easing, with culture secretary Oliver Dowden suggesting “normal life is slowly returning”.Outdoor pools can reopen from Saturday 11 July and indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports facilities may open from Saturday 25 July with new guidance on spacing out and cleaning equipment, plus limiting the number of people in facilities and smaller class sizes.Certain team sports such as cricket will also be able to return from this weekend and outdoor theatre and music will also be possible from Saturday with limited audiences.Dowden said following hairdressers reopening on 4 July, beauticians, tattooists, spas, and tanning salons and other “close contact services” like nail bars can also reopen from Monday. However, necessary restrictions on procedures carried out directly in-front of the face will severely limit what some businesses can offer.The move to reopen as many fitness facilities as possible comes as Boris Johnson is said to have a renewed focus on his own health and tackling the nation’s obesity levels.Dowden said: “Exercise is incredibly important for both physical and mental health. Even at the height of the lockdown it was considered an essential activity.Gym chains and trainers had expressed disappointment after it was left out of the loosening of restrictions which came into effect last weekend, which allowed pubs, restaurants and bars to reopen if they adhered to public health guidelines.At the time, the chief executive of PureGym, the UK’s biggest gym chain, said the decision seemed odd in the light of Johnson’s stated intention to improve the UK’s health after the Covid-19 crisis.“It is a strange war on obesity that sees pubs and restaurants open before gyms,” Humphrey Cobbold said.The new guidance for gyms, pools and leisure centres includes limiting the number of people using the facility at any one time, which may require a booking system. It is also recommended that in a gym each person has 100 sq ft, or approximately nine square metres of space to use, which would include the toilet and changing areas.Among the other measures suggested are improving cleaning and providing hand sanitiser throughout venues ensuring there is better ventilation, and temporary floor markings for exercise or dance studios.As well as limiting numbers able to use pools, people are advised to arrive in their swimming costumes to minimise the amount of time in changing rooms.Recreational team sports such as cricket are able to begin their return from 11 July if they can show Covid-secure plans, which the England and Wales Cricket Board has already submitted to government.Supporters will also be allowed to attend community fixtures in small numbers provided they are in groups of two households only, or no larger than six people from different households, and adhere to social distancing measures.Each inidual sport will be able to submit to the government an action plan showing how it plans to operate. The action plans must recognise that the return of recreational sport may need to be paused in the event of a raised Covid-19 threat level either nationally or locally.Organisers will be asked to help track and trace efforts by collecting information on participants at both training and matches.Sports where a single ball is used, such as basketball, cricket and football, need to include how they will reduce the risk of this transmitting the virus.Asked during the press conference what the scientific basis is for opening gyms and nail bars, and if there has been an assessment since last weekend’s reopening of pubs and restaurants, Dowden said he had consulted with the chief medical adviser Chris Whitty.The department for business advised the beauty sector that face waxing, eyelash treatments, make-up application and facial treatments, will not be allowed until government advice changes, due to the much greater risk of transmission.Millie Kendall, from the British Beauty Council, said: “The decision to broaden the scope of available hair and beauty services will allow many more beauty professionals to get back to work, and will also allow customers to benefit from a range of beauty treatments which can be carried out safely for both client and practitioner.“It’s a positive step, but we are still only part of the way there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed003cc6f1125e654114e03df8ec27cb0550c947/0_14_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15c80c18f1e2b80cfca7edc06931274c","title":"how to stop your glasses steaming up and 19 other essential facts about face masks","story":"How often should you wash a cloth mask? And how effective are the disposable ones? The expert guide to choosing, wearing and caring for your face coveringPerhaps one of the problems has been the changing advice as new evidence emerges. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends people wear cloth masks. Ramakrishnan said that in the UK, “the message has not been clear enough, so perhaps people do not really understand the benefits or are not convinced”. It also doesn’t help that the guidance across the UK is different.In England, it is mandatory to wear a mask on public transport and in hospitals, for visitors and outpatients. From Friday, masks will be mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland, and Scotland is also extending that to shops this week. In Wales masks are recommended, though not obligatory, on public transport.A mask, says Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, is a “means of reducing the propensity of someone who has got Covid-19 to spread it to others. We’re not talking about protecting yourself by wearing one, but about reducing the risk to other people.” Wearing a mask is just one measure, along with handwashing and social distancing, to try to contain Covid-19, and seems particularly useful for stopping people who have unwittingly contracted the virus, but who are not showing symptoms, from spreading (if you do have symptoms, you should be self-isolating, not going out wearing a mask). “What you’re doing,” McKee says, “is catching all the little droplets that are coming out of your mouth before they can get into the atmosphere, when they can dry out and become very small and float around as an aerosol. There is still stuff that is going to get out, but you are reducing that risk.”With so many of us still coming to terms with this “new normal”, we asked McKee and other experts to answer some common questions.“Indoors,” says McKee. “The risk of transmitting the virus outside is low. The risk is indoors, in crowded situations, where the air is not being filtered out, and particularly where people are speaking loudly, shouting or singing.” People should wear them at the supermarket and while out shopping, says Maitreyi Shivkumar, a virologist and lecturer in molecular biology at De Montfort University, and anywhere you’re “likely to come into closer contact with people you can’t really get away from”. Do you need to wear one while exercising outdoors? McKee says not, but Shivkumar says possibly. “I’ve seen pictures of lots of people running alongside the Thames in London, and in that scenario I would suggest you wear one. Outdoors, if you’re staying away from people, it’s fine, but in large crowds you should wear one.”The one that may provide maximum protection for the wearer, says Shivkumar, is a FFP3 respirator (a disposable shaped mask with a valve that filters air) “but we know that the production of them is more difficult and healthcare workers are not getting access to them, so it is important to reserve those for frontline workers who come into contact with Covid-19 patients”. And anyway, masks with valves – found on dust masks and antipollution cycling masks, for instance – are not thought to be effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19. A study by researchers at the University of Edinburgh into different mask types found that the valves improved breathability for the wearer, but would not stop infectious matter being breathed out. “For the public, cloth masks are fine,” says Shivkumar. “There’s not a lot of data on the efficacy of cloth masks but they’re better than nothing.”Jeremy Howard, a data scientist and cofounder of the campaigning organisation Masks4All, says you should really only wear one once. “They’re not designed to be worn more than once or cleaned,” he says.“They’re not a great choice to use at all,” he adds. “Disposable masks are generally surgical masks: they’re designed to protect from all the stuff that might be coming out of the surgeon’s face during surgery. They have to do so many things that they’re not perfect at any of them. A cloth mask, on the other hand, can have a better fit and more absorbent materials, and can be reused as many times as you like. It really is a better approach.”Some disposable masks come with an expiry date. If you’re planning to wear one for everyday use, is this something to worry about? “Do you want the official answer?” says McKee with a laugh. “I’d have to say yes.” But in reality, he goes on to say, as long as you’re using the mask to nip to the chemists on the bus, rather than caring for Covid-19 patients in hospital, “the risk of using ones past their expiry date, providing they actually look physically all right, is probably fine for this sort of circumstance”.You can buy lots of ready-made cloth masks now, but there are also tutorials online showing you how to make your own. “Nearly any kind of face-covering is effective at blocking droplets coming out of your mouth,” says Howard. “Shortly after they come out of your mouth, they evaporate and become much harder to block, which means it is more difficult for masks to block droplets coming into your mouth.” There isn’t good evidence that wearing a mask will prevent you from getting (as opposed to spreading) Covid-19.Any kind of tightly woven fabric is a good choice, says Shivkumar. “The more tightly woven, the better.” Howard recommends using cotton of 600-thread-count (if you can find this out – it’s the number of threads an inch). “Things such as high-quality bedsheets, for example. Generally, a better-quality cotton is going to have a higher thread count.” The WHO advises a combination of fabrics, with an inner layer of absorbent fabric (to contain the droplets) and a more waterproof outer layer, such as polyester.No, although, says Howard, “it’s better than nothing”. The fabric may be too thin or, if it’s a chunkier scarf, it can be difficult to get several comfortable layers out of it. “There was some data suggesting that bandanas and scarves are not very good because the fabric has a lot of holes in it,” says Shivkumar.The WHO advises a minimum of three, although four layers can be up to seven times more effective than a single bit of fabric. The problem, says Howard, is “you don’t want to go overboard because it reduces breathability”. He suggests two layers of cloth with a filter inserted between them this should be of a different material, such as a piece of paper towel or silk (Shivkumar has heard of people using coffee filters). “I use a piece of paper towel – I’ve got a little pocket for it in my mask,” says Howard. “When I come home after going out, I dispose of that, and put in a new one.”According to the University of Edinburgh study, masks need to have a tight fit to be really effective, though this needs to be balanced with wearability (a looser mask is better than no mask). It needs to be fairly snug to block droplets coming out of your mouth, and even though it has not been proven that a cloth mask (rather than personal protective equipment) protects the wearer from Covid-19, this may change. There is “some evidence that masks might directly benefit the wearer”, according to Paul Edelstein, emeritus professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the authors of a new report for the Royal Society.There are three places to check for fit, says Howard. The first is around your nose. “It’s a good idea to use something with a mouldable nosepiece. If your mask doesn’t have one, you can get a paperclip, a pipe cleaner or even just a piece of aluminium foil that you can roll up, attach to the top of your mask and mould to your face.” It should be snug around your chin, and fit well over your cheeks. “This is where cloth masks can be quite a lot better than surgical masks,” says Howard. “You can get or make a cloth mask that goes further, closer to your ears, and then tie it up around the back of your head. Surgical masks tend not to be as wide.”“Before you put the mask on, wash your hands,” says Shivkumar. “Only touch the straps try to avoid touching the mask area.” Howard is a bit more relaxed: “Surface transmission through cloth is pretty much unheard of for Covid-19. Officially, the medical advice is to take it off from the straps rather than the front, and you may as well do that because it’s easier.”Even if the chance of picking up an infection from your mask is low, you’ll want to keep it as clean as possible – wearing a dirty face-covering isn’t going to be particularly pleasant. “Put it in maybe a Ziploc bag that keeps it away from everything else – that’s what I tend to do,” says Shivkumar. “It’s going to be fine if you put it in your bag and it’s wrapped in a scarf or something.”Howard thinks that, for most of us, one mask a day should be sufficient. “If you’re doing extremely hot work and getting super-sweaty, you should probably change it if it gets very wet,” he says.It also depends on the material – a thin mask, or scarf, will become damp quickly. “Once it becomes damp, it’s not going to be as effective,” says Shivkumar. “But I’m hoping people are going to continue to be sensible and not spend hours together in a situation where they would have to wear masks.” McKee questions whether a damp mask is going to be less effective, but he adds it can cause other problems, such as skin irritation. “You wouldn’t want to be wearing a damp mask.”Treat your face mask “the same way as you treat your socks or underpants”, says Howard – as long as you’re the sort of person who only gets one wear out of their pants before washing. “It’s good to have a spare mask so you can have one being washed and wear the other one the next day.”Howard says you can – as long as the masks have been washed thoroughly.“In our house, we present wearing a mask as something that’s fun and exciting,” says Howard. “We let our daughter pick out which colour she wants.” Explain to your child why masks are a good idea. “We talked about how coronavirus is a disease that can make people sick, and we could even make her grandmother sick if we weren’t wearing a mask.” Make sure you have a mask that is child-sized and as comfortable as possible, “and particularly think about breathability”. In England, the government has said that children under the age of three should not wear a mask, but it is under five for those in Scotland. In England, children under the age of 11 are exempt from mandatory masks in Northern Ireland, it will be children under 13. As with adults, children with breathing difficulties, disabilities or who are unable to put on or take a mask off unassisted are exempt.If you are sitting indoors, should you wear a mask to order from the waiter and then take it off to eat? “I can’t see how this would work,” says Shivkumar. “The thing to remember with masks is: it’s not everything – it is important along with washing your hands, not touching your face and social distancing. It’s part of the bigger picture.”“If it’s a well-aired house, it’s maybe not necessary, but I would say generally if you’re indoors, stay 2 metres away and wear a mask, and that will reduce the risk,” says Shivkumar. “It’s about recognising the risks and working towards reducing them.” It depends on the situation, says McKee. “This is a continuum – trying to reduce it to a yes or no is problematic. If you’re going to be close to them, if you’re going to be there for a long period of time and it’s a very confined space, then you’re moving towards a point where you may think about wearing a mask. If you’re not going to be close to them, or if it’s a large room, then you’re towards the end of not needing to wear one.”As well as younger children (see above), there are exemptions for some people with health conditions or disabilities and people who assist them. For example, if you are travelling with someone who relies on lip-reading, you are not required to wear a mask. “There may be people for whom it may be very difficult,” says McKee. Asthma UK advises people with asthma to try a few different face coverings to see if they can find one that works for them. “We need to think about people who lip-read,” says McKee. “There are transparent masks that may help, but we have to recognise it is going to be a problem. And it may be an issue for people with learning disabilities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40bb074a5452e2238dbcaaf739ab7ca4d5eab565/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6fd7792c5af60013af6c77984c62f05","title":"stormzy black lives matter","story":"Rapper talks to the BBC about the ‘hundreds, thousands of years of real pain’ suffered by black peopleThe Black Lives Matter movement represents “hundreds, thousands of years” of “real pain”, Stormzy has told the BBC.In a short video feature in which the rapper surprised a young fan by painting his bedroom in recognition of his positive behaviour at school, Stormzy said he wanted the movement to “show what it means to be black”.Addressing criticisms of the protests and the response that “all lives matter”, he said: “If we weren’t oppressed, we wouldn’t be shouting, we would just be living our lives.”He continued: “I want you to understand that we’re not just crying or just shouting, acting like only black lives matter: that this is a real pain. This ain’t some sort of trend. This is real life and this has been our reality for hundreds, thousands of years.”He said he had attended the recent London Black Lives Matter protests but hadn’t spoken in public. “I don’t have answers,” he said. “We’re all just standing together and cheering.”Stormzy was participating in a benefit organised by Good Guys Decorating, a social enterprise that dedicates a premium charge made by paying clients to providing free decorating for people in need.In June, Stormzy announced that he would dedicate £10m over 10 years to black British causes,. He described it as “the beginning of a lifetime commitment”.Announcing the plan, he said: “I am not the UK’s shining example of what supposedly happens when a black person works hard … Black people have been playing on an uneven field for far too long and this pledge is a continuation in the fight to finally try and even it.”It follows his creation of a dedicated scholarship fund to send two black UK students to Cambridge every year.

But as former Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell argues, it is easier said than doneWhen Jonathan Powell arrived in Downing Street in 1997 as Tony Blair’s chief of staff, he was met with a handshake from the head of the civil service. From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate. For Jonathan Powell, the acid test will be whether Gove can deliver on these words, which have echoes back to the 1960s and Harold Wilson’s government’s promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9268c8d75b95240fd7c03da9548e9d6d3f24c361/0_97_4327_2598/master/4327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c0e833d3fce6855b99cf0ab1ef66245","title":"the leicester garment factories exposed by covid 19","story":"A spike in cases of Covid-19 in Leicester has led  reporter Archie Bland to its garment factories.

It oversees MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and has the power to release the delayed Russia report, postponed from before the election.The others on the committee are the Conservative MPs Theresa Villiers, Sir John Hayes, Julian Lewis and Mark Pritchard, the Labour MPs Kevan Jones and Diana Johnson, the SNP MP Stewart Hosie and the Labour peer Lord West.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: “It is then deeply concerning that the latest plan devised by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson will aim to parachute Chris Grayling as chair of the committee by putting forward favourable Tory members who will vote him through as chair.”Opposition nominees were attempting to organise a rearguard action to block Grayling’s appointment, although that would require a Conservative to defect. Normally the Tories would have nominated a peer as a member, but the concern was that any nominee might be less likely to support the former minister.Grayling is best known as an error-prone minister who presided over the collapse of Northern and Thameslink rail services and the granting of a no-deal Brexit ferry contract to a company with no ships.As justice secretary, he part-privatised the probation service and banned prisoners from receiving books from relatives, a measure that was overturned in the courts. He was also a prominent supporter of leave in the 2016 referendum campaign.The nine members were listed on order papers for the House of Commons and House of Lords, and they are expected to be confirmed after short debates next Monday. Sources said the nine would meet shortly afterwards to confirm who would become chair.It will then be up to the committee to decide whether to release the Russia report, which was blocked by Johnson before the election. It was cleared for release in December, shortly after his election victory, but its final publication remains dependent on the creation of the committee itself.The former ISC chairman Dominic Grieve, who quit the Conservatives and lost his seat at the last election, has called on the committee to publish the Russia report in full as soon as possible, although the new members will have the power to re-edit it.Downing Street has repeatedly said the report contains little that is revelatory, although others who have read it say it is a serious document worth scrutinising.Earlier on Thursday, one minister shrugged off claims the government had “dragged its feet” over the publication of the Russia report. Speaking in the House of Lords, Lord True described it as a “delicate matter”. “It takes some time,” he said, saying the delay was not unusual.The government has said there is no evidence of significant Russian interference in British politics, and True rejected the Lib Dem peer’s claim. “The result of the referendum was in the hands of 17.4 million people who I don’t think were bamboozled by KGB agents,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065963207b0d77eb93d4fc74603b0f1bbe423ef9/0_0_2802_1681/master/2802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83a506cf7406ccd1df8d0c3a946ef85b","title":"ministers to ditch target of 50 of young people in england going to university","story":"Education secretary sets out plans to abandon target introduced by Tony Blair in 1999Gavin Williamson has criticised the idea of wanting half of all young people to go on to higher education, describing it as an “absurd mantra” and signalling an end to a pledge made by Tony Blair in the 1990s that has been supported by successive governments.The education secretary said he wanted to see a revolution in further education and vocational training in England, and updated Blair’s motto, saying: “From now on, our mantra must be further education, further education, further education.”His speech was a preview of the Department for Education’s white paper on post-school education to be published in autumn, which aims to overhaul the types of qualifications offered by colleges to create a “world-class, German-style further education system”, according to Williamson.“It exasperates me that there is still an inbuilt snobbishness about higher being somehow better than further, when really, they are both just different paths to fulfilling and skilled employment.”Much of Williamson’s speech criticised universities for their expansion in recent years, suggesting that they were failing to prepare graduates for the UK’s workforce.“For too long, we’ve been training people for jobs that don’t exist. We need to train them for the jobs that do exist and will exist in the future.“We have to end the focus on qualifications for qualifications’ sake. We need fundamental reform: a wholesale rebalancing towards further and technical education,” he said, arguing that workers with higher technical apprenticeships earned more than the average graduate.Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Increasing support for further education is an important move but it would be a mistake to view post-18 education as a binary choice between supporting either higher education or further education.”While the Tories never explicitly adopted Blair’s policy, the party’s efforts in government have been an endorsement of the aim, including its 2015 decision to abolish the cap on the number of students each university in England could enrol.David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association of Colleges, which represents further education and other tertiary institutions, supported the change and said Williamson’s speech was a “rallying call” for a more coherent education system.Williamson said that since becoming education secretary last year he had been “shocked to discover that while the number of people going to university has increased, the total number of adults in education has actually fallen”.Williamson cited sharp drops in the numbers of people studying part-time or in adult education in England as reasons for concern.Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said further education had been hit particularly hard under the Conservative government’s austerity programme.Williamson’s announcement comes at a time of considerable danger for the higher education sector, which faces losing billions of pounds as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and its aftermath.This week the Institute for Fiscal Studies said 10 universities in England and three elsewhere in the UK were threatened by severe financial difficulties, with the sector to be hit by losses of £3bn to £19bn next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf3412aab2d8e46896ee1f0a78bdecf1856236a3/0_211_6331_3798/master/6331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=319c5cb4c5cfc6b263837b734ebf89c4","title":"no masks wagamama criticised over rishi sunak photo op","story":" Chancellor visited branch after summer statement, but some have pointed to his lack of PPERishi Sunak was nowhere to be seen on Thursday at the central London branch of Wagamama where the chancellor did a stint as a waiter in a PR stunt that followed the announcement of his £30bn economic plan the day before, though his appearance left a bad taste for some.“He’s off today,” laughed one member of staff, as dozens of customers braved the pandemic to dine on lunchtime udon and ramen.Elsewhere, however, eyebrows were being raised. “Hey @wagamama_uk sort it out, please...no masks, nor visors...,” was just one of a number of hostile tweets directed at the company after the photo opportunity in which a barefaced and gloveless Sunak served food to customers and chatted at a close distance.“Do you let all your staff break procedures by not wearing masks when serving food to the public in the midst of a pandemic? Think I’ll give your place a miss thanks,” added another reply to a tweet by Wagamama, though some were also complimentary of the chain and the chancellor’s measures to kickstart the hospitality trade.True to the “six safety steps” set out on the company’s website, a visored “safety host” was on hand to meet, greet and marshal arriving customers at the branch near Waterloo on Thursday. Inside, customers were seated apart among movable screens, while staff cleaned tables and sought to maintain a safe distance.

But there was also evidence of shakiness there. Customers clicking on what the website promised would be answers to frequently asked questionsabout how it was “staying safe” were met with a message telling them “nothing to see here” and stating that the page appeared to have been moved, deleted or did not exist.Sunak has bid farewell to his brief stint on the restaurant floor. Pivoting back to the political beat, he defended his social media messaging when asked about mockery of his penchant for posting graphics and soft-focus pictures overlaid with text – labelled “brand Rishi’ by some.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m keen to try and get our message across to as many people as possible and engage them, and if that means they poke some fun at me in the process so be it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68bac65af8a0ac4a66cc84a8045912df873fba6/2_194_3362_2016/master/3362.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=bfc9f5eade2ed64f014b768da33a22be","title":"asymptomatic testing extended to thousands of workers in england coronavirus","story":"Taxi drivers, cleaners and shop staff among those to be tested for coronavirus in pilot schemeTens of thousands of people in England whose jobs put them at a high risk of catching Covid-19 will be tested for the virus even if they have no symptoms, the government has announced.Taxi drivers, cleaners and shop workers will get tests as part of a pilot scheme beginning immediately. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it hoped the scheme would improve understanding of the prevalence of the virus among people judged to be at higher risk.Meanwhile, new figures show that the government failed to meet a target to have all test results back within 24 hours by the end of June.Boris Johnson made the commitment to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt during prime minister’s questions in early June amid concerns that not enough people were being tested for Covid-19.

Mission clarity. Compassionate ruthlessness.The unhappy 2012 Tour when Bradley Wiggins and Froome failed to gel perfectly taught Brailsford about mission clarity: make sure your leaders know the hierarchy and be certain they will stick to it. The emergence of a young, thrusting talent in the 2019 Tour winner, Egan Bernal, alongside two former winners in Froome and Geraint Thomas would be a nightmare to handle in ideal circumstances. Achieving clarity while racing the Tour with two leaders is bad enough, but three would be a very crowded marriage.When the one of the three with the strongest record is also trying to construct a comeback from a career-threatening injury, as Froome is, the nightmare is compounded. Someone had to go, and Froome was always going to be the one. From his perspective there is another factor: the death in March of Nicolas Portal, the SkyIneos director sportive, which robbed him of his staunchest ally within the team.History makes it plain how Brailsford and Froome can part company. In 2013, when Froome was the thrusting Tour contender and Wiggins was trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life, Brailsford had little hesitation in throwing sentiment aside, ditching a rider he had worked with since his career started, and going with Froome. A lesser man might have backed Sir Brad, but Sir Dave had the clarity of mind, the nerve and the cold-bloodedness to go with Froome. Given the results the pair have achieved since then, it was clearly the right move. Compassionate ruthlessness: wield the knife but in the front not the back and do it with a kind smile while saying the right things.Chris Froome has won seven Grand Tours since joining Team Sky in 2010Froome outshines his team leader, Bradley Wiggins, to finish second at the 2011 Vuelta. He is later upgraded to first place after the original winner, Juan José Cobo, was disqualified for drug offencesFroome came second to Wiggins at the 2012 Tour but was the team leader at the next edition, where a memorable surge up Mont Ventoux leads him to his first Tour de France titleAfter crashing out early in 2014, Froome bounces back to win the 2015 edition after a battle through the mountains with Nairo Quintana. Froome defends his title in all-action style in 2016, even running a few yards up Ventoux when his bike is damagedFroome wins his fourth Tour de France, and third in succession, in 2017 and follows it up with a second Vuelta title. He becomes the first rider from outside France to win the Tour and Vuelta back-to-backFroome gets the better of Simon Yates in a spectacular ride on the Colle delle Finestre to win his first Giro and complete his Grand Tour collection. At the 2018 Tour, he ends up working to lead his teammate, Geraint Thomas, to overall victoryThe split raises obvious questions. First, what will Froome’s programme be for the end of the season? Will Ineos dare put their former leader in the Tour de France? Froome will be desperate to ride but why would Brailsford want to risk disrupting the balance of his team? And how would Froome react if told politely that he can have his head in the Giro or the Vuelta, albeit not with the same level of team support?How will Froome deal with transferring to his new team for 2021 and can he return to his former level? Whatever the training numbers, the only way of seeing if he can come back after his accident of last year to what he was from 2015‑18 is for him to ride a Grand Tour in anger. So to that extent, it may be the best solution for him to return in the Giro or the Vuelta, away from the hothouse of the Tour de France and away from the constant questions about who is leader.Whether Israel Start-Up Nation can offer him the same level of support as Ineos is a simpler one: they can’t, until 2022 at the earliest. By 2013, when Froome won his first Tour, Team Sky had two successful Grand Tour-focused seasons behind them, winning the 2011 Vuelta and the 2012 Tour. By 2017-18, when he achieved the grand slam of Tour, Vuelta and Giro on the trot, Team Sky were the best Grand Tour team, at least since Miguel Induráin’s Banesto.Even if budget is not a factor, a machine of that quality is not constructed overnight putting the parts in place takes time, and getting them to work in harmony takes longer. ISN have not even begun to shop around beyond their leader and there is no chance of them buying the team riders they need before the end of 2021. Next year, Froome will have to cope without the multiple support riders in the mountains that Team Sky bought and developed over the years.He is a doughty competitor but even if he returns to his best – a considerable ask at 36 years of age, as he will be next year – he will be at a disadvantage faced with more seasoned units such as Ineos, Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo‑Visma and Thibaut Pinot’s FDJ. A leader of Froome’s quality will lift those around him, speeding up the development process but it could be that ISN improve as his strength fades with age.When the history books are written, the relationship between Froome and Brailsford will be simple to sum up. This is not a sudden, acrimonious breakup when one party pushed the other too far, along the lines of Induráin’s sudden departure from Banesto in 1996. Induráin was their boy through and through and could not contemplate riding for any other team, hence his decision to retire rather than move.This partnership between Froome and Brailsford is more cold-blooded, a marriage of convenience between two equally hard-nosed and driven men, each with an eye for the main chance and each of whom found considerable use for the other. As with Wiggins, when the end had to come, there will have been warm words but little sentiment and no tears in private."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae4801b9cd9c82ae2c48753e97feeb7d5c1f495/0_286_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8121861a673226f7b606e435af8a172b","title":"gemma bodinetz liverpool theatre everyman playhouse lizzie nunnery tribute","story":"As the artistic director of the Everyman and Playhouse theatres steps down after 17 years, local playwright Lizzie Nunnery celebrates her achievementI’m 24, sitting in a windowless meeting room in the old Everyman theatre annexe, sharing awkward glances with the other members of the young writers’ group. In sweep Gemma Bodinetz and Deborah Aydon (even their names seem glamorous). This is the new artistic director and executive director, all hair and heels and attitude and ideas. These are the women who are leading the transformation of the Everyman and Playhouse theatres and they’ve come to hear how we want that to happen. Us?It was thrilling. Maybe it seemed too good to be true. In 2003, the Everyman as a vibrant new writing theatre was an old story: something the city once had in the days of Willy Russell and Alan Dossor. Alongside the literary manager, Suzanne Bell, Gemma set out to make it a present reality again.I remember with razor-sharp clarity, Gemma’s production of Dael Orlandersmith’s Yellowman at the Ev in 2004: feeling unable to breathe because the emotion was so high in the room. Then, later that year, laughing and sobbing in equal measure at her treatment of Tony Green’s Liverpool asylum epic, The Kindness of Strangers. This was shared experience. This was vital, transformative storytelling.In those days I was shy and fairly inarticulate off the page. It would have been easy for Gemma to have overlooked me. But she did what seemed miraculous: she listened. She asked for my ideas and took them seriously. In 2006, when I placed a scrappy draft on her desk, about an impoverished Irish woman in Victorian Liverpool, she didn’t say, “Where are the jokes?” or, “Maybe your next play.” She said, “Let’s work on this together” and plonked that obscurely titled play by an unknown female writer on the great big Everyman stage for three weeks, without any apologies.Under her direction, Intemperance became an elegant production beyond my furthest imaginings. Sadly, in 2020, that programming seems bolder and more unusual than it did then. But they were bold days. In the Everyman bistro we used to (only half jokingly) talk about world domination for Liverpool’s new writing. Making that show with Gemma made me fall so deeply in love with theatre I’ve never quite recovered. As Springsteen says: “You can’t start a fire without a spark.” For me, that was the spark. It was the moment I held my head up and said, “I’m a playwright.” There are countless artists in Liverpool who could tell similar stories.Seventeen years later, I’m roughly the age Gemma was when I met her, and only now realise what a mountain she had to climb, and how skilfully she scaled it. She was an adventurer throwing her arms open to a city that likes to scrutinise newcomers. There were cynics who thought she wouldn’t hang around past capital-of-culture year. But over time, we forgot she arrived in Liverpool one rainy day in 2003. She’d become part of our landscape.New writing in Liverpool has not (as yet) achieved world domination. And there are many in Merseyside’s erse communities who still feel out in the cold – their voices still not heard on stages or in meeting rooms. But God, I hope whoever steps up to the challenge does it with the same energy, big heart and good intentions that Gemma did. Her aim was to make the two theatres feel like home. For so many, she succeeded. As she steps aside, we notice the gaps she worked so hard to fill (for artists, audiences, communities) and the gaps that remain. One era gives birth to the next. Let the sparks fly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b840bb547121bdb6f30b0a06b2a8f0f3ff3b4e80/290_0_4939_2963/master/4939.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fa2801710018359715221b7538fc1a9c","title":"dell xps 13 2020 review a fantastic but flawed laptop","story":"Cons: short battery life, only two USB-CThunderbolt 3 ports, softwareBIOS issues, expensive, mics not great for video conferencing at a distance, speakers are shrill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3344660a12d1102bba8a0486dc649ff2f951a722/0_70_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48d14a84f961548cd741e0624af1018a","title":"removing huawei by 2023 would cause data blackouts mps told","story":"BT executive says UK customers on 5G, 4G and 2G would all face problems if equipment removedThe UK would face mobile phone “blackouts” if networks were required to remove all Huawei equipment by 2023, a BT executive has told MPs.Speaking to the Commons science and technology committee, Howard Watson, BT’s chief technology and information officer, said the proposed three-year timeframe for the removal of the Chinese firm from Britain’s mobile phone infrastructure was borderline unachievable.“To get to zero in a three-year period would literally mean blackouts for customers on 4G and 2G, as well as 5G, throughout the country,” Watson said, citing the logistical difficulty of physically working on that many masts in a short timeframe.Vodafone UK’s head of networks, Andrea Donà, corroborated Watson’s warning, saying the necessary works would create signal blackspots, “sometimes for a couple of days, depending on how big or how intrusive the work carried out is”.Huawei has come under deep scrutiny for its links to the Chinese state, although the company has always insisted it is a fully independent employee-owned organisation.However, Boris Johnson is now thought to be preparing to cave in to Conservative backbench rebels opposed to the presence of Huawei in 5G networks and drawing up plans to reduce the Chinese company’s involvement to zero by 2023.Last week, a former head of MI6, John Sawers, argued that strict US sanctions meant Huawei was more integrated with Chinese tech than ever, and now posed an unacceptable security risk.As well as the blackouts caused by the work of switching to new suppliers, the change would be extremely expensive. But BT and Vodafone appear to have given up hope of winning in the long term, with both firms arguing in the commons only for a slow switchover – a change from their position at the beginning of the year.Huawei’s claim to be independent wasn’t helped by the firm’s own showing in front of the committee, when the company’s UK chief executive, Jeremy Thompson, walked into a trap set by the chair, Greg Clark. Asked by Clark whether UK Huawei employees were free to express their views, Thompson replied: “Yes. Very much so. We have a management team in the UK like any other UK organisation and we are free to express our views, yes.”Clark then asked: “So what is your view of the new security law in Hong Kong?” Thompson declined to answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

You’re sitting on a sunny terrace, enjoying the view, watching the locals, as you realise you’ve done it, you’re living la dolce vita – the sweet life.That’s what aperitivo hour is all about. This slow and stylish start to the evening begins just before sunset, when, in the enchanting pre-dinner twilight, Italians of all ages gather for drinks, snacks and friendship. It’s life-affirming.A slower pace has many benefits. Why rush straight from your working day into dinner, when you can first enjoy one of life’s simple pleasures: spending time with friends and family over a refreshing drink and some light snacks? This slowing, steadying hour can become the bridge between the responsibilities of your working day and the delights of your dinner. Much magic lies on that bridge.It’s still a nationwide event in Italy, observed across the generations in humble taverns, charming trattorias and trendy rooftop bars. Connoisseurs of the aperitivo hour say Florence, Turin and Venice are standard bearers for the tradition, but many agree that Milan is where its heart lies. In truth, aperitivo takes place all across Italy from the northern regions mentioned right through to the stunning Amalfi coast in southern Italy, so wherever the visitor roams, they will be able to enjoy this elegant tradition. Just sit back, relax, and bask in it. The conversations and bonding of aperitivo hour bring new perspectives on life.Many of us have been charmed by an easier-going routine during a fortnight abroad in the summer. As the taxi takes us back to the airport to fly home, we promise ourselves that we will continue to live that kinder way at home but that ambitious oath seems to get lost somewhere around the luggage carousel back in Blighty.Well, it’s never too late to start. With some travel restrictions still in place, now is the perfect moment to bring the Italian experience to your home. In a way, the events of the past few months have been training us for it. Many of us have been forced to take our foot off the pedal and ease into the slow lane, so there is no simpler time to bring the aperitivo into your home.Even as lockdown restrictions ease and the pace of life begins to pick up again, why not keep one foot in that lane by making the time and space to savour the spirit – and spirits – of aperitivo? Your patio, balcony, dining room or kitchen are all perfect venues for such an affair. Invite some family or friends to join you virtually this is a lifestyle that can be transferred to Zoom when needed.A perfect spirit for this hour is the new flavoured range from Malfy Gin. The Con Limone weds the brand’s unique gin recipe with the finest Italian lemons, grown along the Amalfi coastline.The Rosa, meanwhile, boasts sun-ripened Sicilian pink grapefruits, cultivated on the Mediterranean coast where the mountains greet the sea. Or you might prefer the Con Arancia, with its blood orange peels, also sourced from Sicily.These clean and crisp drinks, inspired by the glamour of the Amalfi coast, are ideal if you’re looking to bring a little Italian luxury to your aperitivo hour, and all three pair deliciously with tonic water.If you want to go full-aperitivo, include some snacks. They should be small, simple and artful, because aperitivo hour is, after all, an elegant philosophy about easing out of the day and opening up the palate.In aperitivo hour, you can slow down, socialise and sip some fine drinks. The aperitivo is so much more than just a happy hour - it’s the happiest of hours.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

We stopped halfway, seeing a sign for a footpath to the lakes. Over a hill and after 40 minutes we came to a vast and beautiful hidden valley. In this natural bowl, horses, cows, sheep and goats were wandering, bells tinkling, a stream snaking through and a waterfall cascading down the far side of the valley. Behind us were snow-capped mountains. It was a scene of such Tolkien beauty that I half expected to see an elven princess on a unicorn. All of it empty and just for us.Colin BeesleyEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print.

Spires of rock soared behind us to the cloudless sky and pristine water gurgled below us. We climbed on a winding path above the treeline and down to wide, stone-strewn river channels that showed the power of the ice melt in spring. There was no tarmac road so very few vehicles. Just nature, like an extant Eden. This is the village of Thethi in northern Albania.Andy ClarkThe hike from Positano to the top of Molare, the highest point on the Amalfi peninsula at 1,444 metres, is one of the best I’ve done in 30 years of walking. The views take in Vesuvius, the Bay of Naples and Capri, and you can even make out Pompeii if you know where to look. On a June day I met nobody, despite this being one of the most-visited areas in Italy.Garrett DundonThis Swedish-speaking autonomous region of Finland is a beautiful archipelago between the two countries. Fasta Åland, the main island, can be easily explored by cycling the network of quiet countryside roads (bikes can be hired, even with a buggy for your luggage). Stop off for dips at lakes and beaches, or sample produce from the famous apple orchards. Take in the red-and-white wooden houses, local dishes (especially the Åland pancake served with plum jam) and wildlife (including elk). You can fly there but it’s more fun to take a ferry from Sweden (Stockholm) or Finland (Turku or Helsinki).FranBovec is a wonderful small town that’s a base for a host of outdoor activities, including climbing Mount Kanin, cycling in the Soča valley and white-water rafting down the Soča River. The journey from Ljubljana involves a hair-raising trip up (and then back down) the 1,611-metre Vršič Pass. The town itself has enough restaurants and bars (including the Thirsty River microbrewery) to keep you occupied in the evenings after days of exertion. We stayed at Mrakic apartments, with charming host Vasja providing breakfast plus tips and guidance on where to go.Thom PiddockHidden above the pretty harbour of Vela Luka, on the island of Korčula on the Dalmatian coast, is an archeological site that dates back to the stone age. Climb 130 metres up Pinski Rat hill to Vela Spila cave. Step inside and be swallowed up by its magnificent 40-metre-wide oval cavern, where excavations have discovered human activity dating back almost 25,000 years. Head up to the mouth of the cave at sunset to soak up the colourful panoramic views back across the harbour and the sparkling waters of the Adriatic and islands beyond.Su OinnA sharp bend in the road and suddenly you are looking down at a breathtaking vista of the Atlantic Ocean beyond a sweeping bay fringed with mountains. Tiny multicoloured houses nestle in the centre of the view. This is Allihies, my mother-in-law’s village on the Beara peninsula, in the south-west corner of Ireland. The Beara Way hiking trail skirts the village but there are spectacular coastal walks along the smaller roads, too. In the hills behind the village, tracks lead to the ruins of copper mines. Watch dolphins, gannets, choughs and feral goats, and in the evenings listen to music in one of the three pubs. You’ll soon be talking to my friendly in-laws. JanetIt takes an hour to hike up Canigó mountain, and when you reach the point overlooking the monastery, you are surrounded by peaks as far as the eye can see.

He replied with a grin and one word: “Freedom!”It was Saturday 4 July, the first day that campsites were allowed to open in England after lockdown. My partner and I had left our homes for the first time in nearly four months and driven to the Waveney River Centre in Norfolk, a campsite and marina, to find out what “the new normal” means for campers.We were greeted by a battalion of beaming staff, all happy to get the summer season going at last. The first of many hand-sanitiser points was outside reception, which had a one-in, one-out policy and social-distancing markers. Other than that, check-in proceeded as normal. We were staying in one of seven yurts, all fully booked for the weekend, as were the 14 caravan pitches and six camping pods. Only the 45 tent pitches had deliberately not all been filled, to keep numbers at a manageable level. (There are also 35 self-catering lodges on the site.)As is the case at many campsites, most of the facilities were open, but with some alterations. In the toilet block, alternating cubicles and sinks were taped up so people couldn’t get too close. Staff were stationed at the showers all day, ready to clean them after each use. The main shop was closed, but basic items had been moved to the ice-cream kiosk. The play area was open, but the indoor pool was sadly shut, as per (baffling) government guidance.Liam Holmes, Waveney’s general manager, said early feedback from guests had been positive, with people feeling particularly reassured by the visible extra cleaning.The campsite borders the River Waveney, and we were the first passengers on the newly reopened foot ferry. The service, which dates from the 19th century and was revived in 2012, originally carried south Norfolk villagers to Lowestoft fish market. These days, it takes visitors to Carlton Marshes nature reserve, just across the Suffolk border. We wandered around the marshes, meadows and pools, and spotted birds including a little egret and a marsh harrier. The wide-open space was a balm after so many weeks spent in my tiny London garden.Back at the campsite, we exercised another regained right and went to the pub. The Waveney Inn had a one-way system with separate entrance and exit, and we had to give our details for contact-tracing purposes. It was table-service only, with contactless payment for our Southwold bitter, fish and chips and ploughman’s salad. No one seem deterred by the new measures: the pub was full of families enjoying themselves.A cold wind had whipped up by bedtime, which gave us a good excuse to light the woodburner in our yurt. The yurt smelled freshly sanitised (the particular antiviral spray used is specified on the website) and was comfortable, with double bed, sofa and electric lamps guests bring their own bedding.The next day, we hired a day cruiser from the on-site marina to explored this section of the Broads. Several campers were doing the same – there was a queue for the boats. Again, social-distancing measures were in place, with customers fitting their own lifejackets and staff issuing instructions from the bank, rather than boarding boats.We went as far as Reedham, a riverside village about two-and-a-half hours away, for a pint at the Ship Inn, then stopped halfway back at the Bell Inn at St Olave’s for lunch (a generous seafood platter). Staff at both pubs were cheerful and welcoming, and the manager of the Bell – “Broadland’s oldest recorded inn” – thanked us for supporting them. After months of nothing more exciting than a daily walk, a day’s boating on the Broads seemed like a real adventure.Back at the marina, we handed the cruiser keys back and walked a few minutes up the lane to St Mary’s church, which has a thatched roof and a ziggurat-style tower. More substantial walks include one to Oulton Broad, via the foot ferry, and on to the sandy beach at Lowestoft. More beaches are a short drive away at Great Yarmouth and Southwold.We ended the day with a barbecue on the deck outside our yurt. By the time we were ready for bed, a low moon was hanging over the river and the sky was full of stars. Our neighbour was right – this was a taste of freedom, and it felt fantastic.• Accommodation at Waveney River Centre was provided by Campsites, camping from £11 a night, yurts from £48 a night"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837d82d424bf10d189bfdb27f21f77544f2dcb23/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=60366b00e8de2cce4d7e5bfd07872c9e","title":"kent airport green light manston reopen international hub critics","story":"Ministers overrule planners on Manston airport as critics point to noise and emissions impactDevelopers have been given permission to rebuild Manston airport as an international cargo and passenger hub, after ministers overruled the planning inspectorate’s recommendation to reject the scheme.The airport in Kent could open by 2023, handling up to 10,000 cargo flights a year as well as passenger services, with construction starting as early as next year.The plans have ided local communities, with some welcoming the promise of additional jobs, but others dismayed at the noise and pollution airport expansion will bring.The decision to grant a development consent order for the scheme against the recommendations of inspectors was officially taken by the transport minister Andrew Stephenson, with the secretary of state, Grant Shapps, recused to avoid any conflict of interest.Inspectors warned that the plans “will have a material impact on the ability of government to meet its carbon reduction targets, including carbon budgets”, and that climate change was another factor that “weighs against the granting of development consent”.The decision was released the day after the government launched its Net Zero board to advise on its transport decarbonisation plan.The reopening of Manston Airport has been a policy championed by UKIP as well as local Conservative MPs since it closed in 2014. Manston had been bought for a nominal £1 a year earlier by Stagecoach co-founder Ann Gloag, and was later sold to rival developers and earmarked for housing.RiverOak Strategic Partners (RSP), who have long targeted the airport and acquired the site last year, said the £300m project would create more than 23,000 jobs, many of which would be in the relatively deprived areas of East Kent. RSP argue that the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit make the need for more specialist air freight capacity vital.Tony Freudmann, director of RSP said: “Once built, Manston will be one of the most modern, efficient and environmentally friendly freight hubs in the world.”North Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale said: “This national asset has been closed for far too long but it can now play a critical role in delivering jobs and investment… Post-Brexit Britain is going to need additional air freight capacity and Manston can offer this swiftly.”A spokesperson for the local No Night Flights campaign group said there was no evidence that the airport would bring jobs: “We are incredulous that the secretary of state would override a recommendation from the planning inspectorate. We will be reviewing our options to challenge this and protect our town from this horrible blight.”Green Party transport spokesperson Caroline Russell said members would continue to campaign to “try and prevent this senseless act, which places the economic benefit of a small number of people ahead of the wellbeing of everybody else”.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209c090ed11aab21e1f185892858fbf039849ea5/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7319e7b804d1734975b2c3771450ac3","title":"mama boko haram nigeria maiduguri","story":"Aisha Wakil knew many of Boko Haram’s fighters as children. Now she uses those ties to broker peace deals, mediate hostage negotiations and convince militants to put down their weapons – but as the violence escalates, her task is becoming impossible. By  Chika OduahIt was another scorching afternoon in Maiduguri. In the west of the city, in Nigeria’s north-east, 51-year-old Aisha Wakil sat in her office talking to a jihadi fighter named Usman. Wakil was draped head-to-toe in fine sequinned chiffon a niqab covered most of her face, leaving visible only her dark eyes. Ka’aji, a sweet, woody incense that Wakil kept burning in a corner, perfumed the room.Wakil and Usman kept their voices down. They were hashing out a secret plan to free a 16-year-old girl who was being held hostage by Boko Haram. It was May 2019, 10 years after the Islamist group had begun terrorising Nigeria as part of a jihad it was waging against the government. The violence, which had spilled into neighbouring countries, had left more than 30,000 people dead.Over the years, Boko Haram had become notorious for kidnapping women and girls. The most infamous instance came in 2014, when its fighters captured 276 schoolgirls from a secondary school in the remote village of Chibok. But there were abductions before Chibok, and dozens after. Some of those captured were forced to become suicide bombers, and Boko Haram has used more than 460 female suicide bombers, more than any other terrorist group in history. The teenage girl who Wakil and Usman were discussing was one of the group’s latest victims. For months, Wakil had been pleading with Boko Haram fighters to free her.With soldiers and local vigilantes trying to hunt them down, the group’s members had largely fled Maiduguri, the largest city in Borno state, and the other cities in the region. They set up camps tucked away in the arid bush land stretching across northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Some fighters went to live in hideouts in the vast former game reserve of Sambisa forest and on the remote islands dotting Lake Chad, where they kept thousands of hostages – women, girls, men and child soldiers forced to join their ranks.After annihilating villages, the fighters would slip back to their camps. Nigerian soldiers scrambled after them, but the army’s heavy vehicles would get stuck in the spiky shrubs and the soft, sandy ground of the Sambisa. They couldn’t venture far into Lake Chad’s swampy coast, especially during the rainy season. The insurgents were swift, cruising over the land in convoys of motorbikes, and then disappearing like smoke.Wakil was one of the few people outside Boko Haram who could reach its members. She was in touch with senior fighters and, in her office that day, she was using that access to negotiate freedom for the hostage. The girl was Christian, and in interviews with the local media, her parents had been asking the Nigerian government to rescue her. Wakil wanted her out safely. She believed Usman was the right person to get the job done. He was, after all, a Boko Haram militant – a mid-ranking one, who travelled between the bush and the city for special assignments.To get to Wakil’s office, Usman had to pass through the city without attracting attention. The streets were crawling with security personnel – soldiers, police officers, intelligence agents, volunteers from the Civilian Joint Task Force, a local paramilitary vigilante group. At the time, Boko Haram attacks were on the rise again and locals moved about with caution. So did Usman. With his frayed clothes, scratched-up hands and lean frame, he fit the physical profile of a Boko Haram fighter perfectly.Usman wanted to do some good. He had decided to cooperate with Wakil, relaying her messages to the mujahideen back in the camp. Their meeting ended on an optimistic note. It seemed possible that the hostage might be freed.Maiduguri is situated within what was the longest-standing kingdom in African history, a powerful pre-colonial Islamic state known as the Kanem-Bornu empire. Established by the ancestors of the modern-day Kanuri people, the empire lasted from the eighth to the 19th century. At one point, the empire’s territory stretched east from modern-day Nigeria through Chad, to Sudan and north to Libya. The empire’s kings – first known as mai, then later as shehu, a derivative of the Arabic title sheikh – were among the first monarchs to practice Islam in sub-Saharan Africa.For a long time, Maiduguri was regarded as the “home of peace”. Life there revolved around Islamic traditions: the call to prayer echoed from mosques. On Fridays, the streets were packed with people making their way to jum’ah prayer thousands of boys sat under trees, reciting verses from the Qur’an under their teachers’ gaze.From the Sahara Desert, cascades of sand blow into the city, covering the terrain in fine layers of dust. At midday, Maiduguri is blindingly hot. It has a particular kind of dry heat that prickles the skin. At night, the heat eases off a bit, giving way to breezes rising over the murky Ngadda River, rustling past neem trees scattered across the land.Wakil moved to the city in 1989, to enrol at the University of Maiduguri. Unlike many of her fellow students, she wasn’t a member of the indigenous Kanuri people – she was Igbo, an ethnic group whose ancestral land lies in the south-east of Nigeria. It was there that Wakil was born, in 1968, and where she grew up, as the country was trying to reconcile and rebuild in the aftermath of the civil war, which ended in 1970.Wakil came from an Igbo family of devout Roman Catholics and she, too, had been deeply devoted to the faith. It led her to God, she said, and throughout her youth she took to reading her Bible and praying for hours on end. It was not until the early 90s that she converted to Islam, after meeting the man she would marry, Alkali Gana Wakil. He was Kanuri and Muslim. “According to the tradition, the woman should follow the man’s religion. I did it to maintain that culture, for peace to reign in my matrimonial home,” Wakil told me.Her relatives back home in the south were deeply disappointed with her conversion, and the fact that she, a “southerner”, had gone off and married “a northerner”. She changed her name to one of the most revered in Islam, Aisha – after the favourite wife of Muhammad and “mother of the believers”. (Today, Wakil refuses to reveal her original Igbo and Christian names.) She and her husband moved into a quaint bungalow close to the most sacred place in Maiduguri – the Shehu’s palace and adjacent mosque complex.The first time I met Wakil, in 2018, she grinned and embraced me tenderly when I told her that I was also Igbo. “It’s like being with my sister,” she said, giggling, and lifted her niqab to let me see her face. Wakil had done her best to adopt Kanuri culture. She burned ka’aji. She took on local beauty customs, keeping her hands and fingers covered in lalle, a type of henna plant dye. She followed the local expectations of a Muslim wife, too, covering her head in a hijab whenever she stepped out of her home. When her husband started telling her that he did not like the way men were admiring her face, she began wearing the niqab to conceal it.Shortly after Wakil moved to her house in Maiduguri, she decided to start leaving her front door open. She was still fairly new to the city and wanted to be welcoming. Soon, poor Kanuri boys, about six or seven years old, began streaming in. Wakil let them play in her compound. Eventually, she would let them garden with her and pick fruit from her trees. Although she already had two of her own children at the time, she started calling these gangly neighbourhood boys her “sons”. In turn, the boys called her “mama”, and to show how much they appreciated her, they started inviting her to attend their circumcision ceremonies, which she ended up sponsoring as a way to help their families, who were struggling financially.The circumcision of a Muslim boy is a sacred rite in northern Nigeria. In Maiduguri, it usually takes place when boys are about seven. Wakil was there at her newfound sons’ circumcisions, holding their hands as they flinched under the blade. When the old men finished cutting, Wakil would gently wash the boy’s penis, submerging it in ka’aji to disinfect it and keep evil spirits away. At the end, she had a chicken killed to celebrate each boy’s rite of passage.But Wakil was still getting used to the customs of north-eastern Nigeria. Some people there saw her as an outsider, a southerner. At times she felt like one, too. And as she continued to adjust to a culture that was so different from the one she grew up in, it was her sons who kept her company. They came to adore the Igbo dishes she cooked them, such as isi ewu, spiced goat’s head steeped in red palm oil. Back in those days, Maiduguri still felt like the city of peace.Around the turn of the century, life in Maiduguri started to change. After 1999, when military rule ended and civilian rule was restored to Nigeria, sectarian tensions increased. Between 1999 and 2001, to ensure that the new secular, democratic government in Abuja would not encroach on Islamic principles, 12 northern states adopted full sharia law. Christians living in the north said they felt threatened by sharia, despite officials’ promises that it would not apply to them.Religious tensions were particularly raw in the wide swathe of fertile land south of Borno state, known in Nigeria as the Middle Belt. In 2001, in one Middle Belt city, Jos, about 1,000 people were killed in violence between Christians and Muslims. In Maiduguri, that same year, a total lunar eclipse sparked a riot, after local Muslim men took the eclipse as a sign that the city was overrun with immorality. News agencies reported that the men set ablaze at least 40 hotels, brothels and bars. The 911 terrorist attacks in New York, and Osama bin Laden’s exhortations to Muslims in Africa to rise up against unbelievers, only added to these existing conflicts.Since the 90s, a man called Mohammed Yusuf had been travelling around Nigeria’s north-east, preaching against western influences. Yusuf subscribed to a radical, militant strand of the conservative Sunni branch of Islam known as Salafism. In his sermons, he attacked boko (meaning secular education) and deemed it haram (sinful). By 2001, Yusuf had a devoted group of followers, known as Yusufiyya, and people started referring to his ideology as Boko Haram.Yusuf tapped into the growing anger at rising inequality in Borno state, where most villages lacked power and clean running water, and the majority of people lived on less than $1.25 a day. He railed against government corruption, as well as the growing influence of western Judeo-Christian culture in the north. He condemned the idolisation of international football stars, the prioritising of Nigeria’s secular constitution over Islam and the government’s push to make primary education compulsory for children.In 2005, Yusuf set up the Ibn Taymiyyah mosque and compound, near Maiduguri’s train station. A few hundred of his followers moved there, settling around the train tracks. Yusuf’s rhetoric got more extreme as he agitated for the Borno state governor to enforce sharia law, beyond its formal adoption in 2000. He railed against the US invasion of Iraq, the torture of Muslim detainees in Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay. He told his followers that Nigeria was an infidel state, and it was time to prepare for jihad against the government. Meanwhile, violence between Christians and Muslims across Nigeria continued to escalate. The worldwide protests that followed a Danish newspaper’s publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad in 2005 led to more deaths in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world. Many protests turned violent, which began a vicious cycle of attacks and counterattacks between Christians and Muslims, leaving dozens dead.Wakil knew Yusuf, having befriended his wife and father-in-law around the time he began amassing a following. She saw him as another son. Maiduguri residents who knew Yusuf told me that he respected Wakil. She would cook for him in his father-in-law’s home, and urge him not to fight the government.Around this time, she noticed her other sons were spending more time at Yusuf’s mosque. “They just began disappearing,” she told me. She remembers one of the boys who went away for three months. When he returned to town, he was no longer the jovial teenager that he used to be. He came back with a quiet, brooding disposition. When she asked where he had been, he told her that he had gone somewhere to learn how to kill people.“I thought it was a joke!” Wakil told me. “Kill people?”At first, she had no idea that jihad training camps were springing up in Nigeria, let alone that one of her sons had participated, upon Yusuf’s instruction. She confronted Yusuf about it. “He didn’t deny it,” Wakil said. “He said they were preparing for jihad.” Later, she learned about a camp in the Middle Belt and her sons started telling her to call them by new names, their noms de guerre.Yusuf and his followers were becoming increasingly combative, repeatedly fighting with security agents. Yusuf’s popularity swelled after each arrest. The final trigger was a now-infamous incident that took place in June 2009. One day when Yusuf was away, his followers were riding in a convoy of motorbikes on their way to a funeral when a government patrol force confronted them to ask why they weren’t wearing helmets. The Yusufiyya argued with the patrol force, and soon shots rang out. It’s not clear who shot first, but several officers ended up wounded, and some of Yusuf’s devotees died. The government never investigated what happened.Yusuf was livid, and responded with a series of diatribes directly threatening the Nigerian government and ordering Muslims to acquire weapons. Those messages went beyond Maiduguri, recorded on DVDs and tapes that circulated across the region.Wakil realised that her sons and Yusuf were headed for trouble. She spoke to his father-in-law about her concerns, and he, too, was worried. On 21 July 2009, police raided the home of a sect member and seized bomb-making materials. The Yusufiyya burned down a police station on 26 July in Bauchi state, west of Borno, where Yusuf had a farm. Police raided the farm, killing dozens of militants. Later that day, jihadists also attacked a police station in Maiduguri and for the next four days, they terrorised the city, killing police and soldiers, and slitting the throats of civilians caught in the middle. In response to the killing spree, Nigerian troops shot more than 100 of Yusuf’s followers. Soldiers captured Yusuf and handed him over to the police, who executed him. Wakil cannot forget the night of 30 July 2009, when she saw Yusuf’s bloodied corpse on the local evening news TV broadcast.The government thought Yusuf’s death was the end of Boko Haram. But it only made things worse. After going into hiding, the group re-emerged in 2010 with Yusuf’s brutal deputy, Abubakar Shekau, as Boko Haram’s new leader. From then on, Boko Haram began targeting schools and kidnapping women. The group’s goal was to overthrow Nigeria’s government and replace it with an Islamic state.Many of Wakil’s sons were now under Shekau’s command. But as appalled as she was by the destructive path her sons had chosen, Wakil felt she couldn’t abandon them, or hand them over to the government. Throughout the nearly two years I spent following her, I never heard Wakil describe any of them as “terrorists”. These were men she had taken care of as they grew up. Now, she decided to pray for them to repent. And she kept looking after them: she gave them clothes, money and phones, believing they could be reformed with love. She took care of the wives and children they left behind in the cities. When state security agents came after Wakil’s sons, she hid them inside her home: they slept in the parlour, while she and her daughter, Ummi, slept in the next room.But she feared how far her sons would go. Maiduguri became an urban war zone. At night, the sound of gunfire filled the air. During the day, residents were afraid to gather for weddings and parties. Speaking out against the militants could get you killed, so residents kept usually silent.But Wakil was an exception. Her associations with Boko Haram were no secret. Producers at a local TV news station invited her to the studio to speak about the rising insecurity. During that broadcast, Wakil said the fighters should stop, that she was pleading to them as a mother to her sons.After that, residents and journalists started calling her “Mama Boko Haram”. She was the only woman who would publicly declare that she spoke regularly to the militants.The University of Maiduguri is the most prestigious university in Nigeria’s north-east. With its modern, expansive campus, more than 20,000 students and international staff, it is the pride of the city. And as a secular, coeducational institution, it was also an obvious target for Boko Haram.In 2012, the group carried out a series of high-profile attacks. In early January, Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria’s president at the time, admitted that Boko Haram members had infiltrated his government and the security services. Later that moth, in Kano, Nigeria’s second-biggest city, Boko Haram carried out a series of coordinated shootings and bombings that left more than 178 dead. Back in Maiduguri, not even the beloved Shehu of Borno – who had publicly denounced Boko Haram as un-Islamic – was safe. He barely escaped a suicide bombing in the central mosque where people were worshiping.That same year, Wakil got a call from one of her sons warning her not to let her daughter Ummi, who was a student at the university, go in that day. The campus was about to be attacked. Wakil spoke as gently as she could. Addressing him as “my son”, she did her best to coax him into abandoning the plan. She told him that killing innocent people was not God’s will. He said there was no way to stop the mission, because everything was already in place, but that she should protect her daughter.When he hung up, Wakil turned to Ummi and told her to rush to school. “She was telling me, go to school quickly,” Ummi later told me. “I didn’t know why she was hurrying me.” Wakil knew that her sons wouldn’t want to bomb the university with her daughter inside. Ummi was like a sister to them: she, too, had taken care of them. So Wakil used her like a human shield.When the insurgents spotted Ummi, the man called Wakil again. Why had Mama let her daughter go to campus, he asked her. After some back and forth, he said that, on Mama’s request, they were going to call off the attack.Very few people outside Boko Haram could claim that kind of influence over its members – and at first, the government considered Wakil’s relationship with them an asset. They believed she could help them open talks with the group.As the violence spiralled, in 2013 Wakil was invited to join a committee that President Jonathan had set up to open talks with the insurgents and broach the option of granting them amnesty. Wakil joined, but the talks didn’t go anywhere. Boko Haram didn’t trust the politicians, and as details of the negotiations kept being leaked to the media, the insurgents became less and less inclined to cooperate.But since Shekau had become Boko Haram’s leader, Wakil had been carrying out her own negotiations, talking to members by phone or through her informants, or meeting them in person in her home. She beseeched them to leave the group, and dozens of them did. She convinced some of them to abandon their arms, directing them to a large rubbish dump in Maiduguri where they could drop the weapon and walk away. A couple of times, militants helped her to disassemble explosives. She buried the pieces in her garden. As we walked around it together, she pointed out the spot where she had destroyed a bomb if I looked hard enough, she said, I might still be able to see pieces of it.She helped former members establish a new life in other parts of the country. One day, she gave money to some 30 ex-militants. With the money, one ended up going to the commercial capital of Lagos to work in the textile sector, she said. Another made his way to the south-east to become a butcher. According to Wakil, many of these sons were killed by vigilantes or arrested once word spread about who they were.Not everyone understood what Wakil was doing. And it wasn’t long before rumours started going around. People said she was suspiciously close to the insurgents. They wondered why her home had been spared, while just about every other area in Maiduguri had been touched by gunfire or a bomb.It was true, Wakil said, that they had agreed never to attack there. But that was because her home was considered a sanctuary by all sides. When bullets were fired in the city, it was where civilians went to seek refuge. Insurgents ran there when they were being pursued by state security and soldiers security officials ran there when they were fleeing Boko Haram.At these moments, government security agents and Boko Haram fighters sometimes came face to face in Wakil’s home, exactly as she wanted. She would bring over bowls of isi ewu and encourage the men to eat together in peace. “They will eat and they will be very happy,” she told me with a laugh. They would be wary at first, but over food they slowly warmed up enough to have frank conversations.It was Wakil’s own version of peacebuilding. But unsurprisingly, some people felt uncomfortable about her unorthodox methods. On 14 August 2016, Wakil was declared wanted by the Nigerian army after the militants released a video of the Chibok girls in captivity. In a statement, the army spokesman, Sani Usman, said that Wakil – and two other people who were wanted, a journalist and a peace activist – was “in possession of information on the conditions and the exact location” of the Chibok girls. “They must, therefore, come forward and tell us,” Usman’s statement went on.Wakil was distraught. Not only did she not know where the girls were, but for years she had been cooperating with the security services. She had met with the army’s chief of staff and kept the military informed about her activities. Now she was being treated as an accomplice. She posted a response on Facebook: “Yes I have links with Boko Haram and you have always known that,” she wrote. “I have been in the front fighting for peace long before Chibok girls were kidnapped. Nigerian security knows me too well, I am not shady. Why declaring me wanted? … this has put my immediate and extended family under a lot of pressure and I do not deserve this from the government.”The next day, Wakil turned herself in at the defence headquarters in Abuja, and was interrogated for about eight hours. Security personnel asked her for her life story, how she ended up in Maiduguri, how she came to know the insurgents. Though she was not offered any public apology, the army accepted her story and released her after 48 hours. She returned to Maiduguri and got back to work.In early September 2018, two years after her interrogation, Wakil sat in her office with two Boko Haram militants. “You hear me? We will come out,” said Ali Garga, one of the Boko Haram militants, in a gentle voice. “We don’t want any security to disturb us, like police.”Wakil sat in her chair quietly listening. She seemed worn out. The previous year, she had launched a nonprofit organisation called Complete Care and Aid Foundation. Every few weeks, she and her team would visit refugee camps, where they would distribute clothes and food to women who had lost their husbands to Boko Haram, as well as check on the storehouse where they kept bags of rice and beans.But the relief work was not her most pressing priority. She urgently wanted to get her boys to stop the violence – and it was taking a physical toll on her. She suffered from acute back pain and crippling headaches. Still, she kept going.“We drop everything, we drop everything, Mama,” Garga went on, speaking on behalf of some of the men in his unit. He did not specify just how many men wanted to surrender. A man with a hard, skinny body and kind eyes, Garga had been a cattle herder before becoming a mujahid. But he had grown tired of the guerrilla life, eventually coming around to see what Boko Haram was doing as criminal, not Islamic. He missed his cows, his home, his freedom. Later, he turned to me and explained that he was surrendering because Wakil was making it possible for him to do so.As part of the surrender, Garga said he planned to release some of the Chibok girls who were still captive. Of the original 276, about 112 are still missing. Garga, who claimed he had about 40 of them under his care in a secret location, told Wakil he would sneak out of the camp with the girls and other abductees.An hour later, Wakil said it was time for her sons to eat. She brought out plastic containers of rice and bottles of water and orange soda. The men sat quietly, scooping up the rice with their hands and then wolfing down their food, until an informant began to praise Wakil. “Mama Aisha, mother of the Boko Haram. May God bless you, Aisha. May God help you,” he said.Three weeks later, I was in Wakil’s home on a Saturday night when she ran towards me with her phone in her hand, shouting, “Ali is dead! Ali is dead!” A trusted informant, whom I had met several times, had just called her. Wakil was hysterical. She threw her body on the cold tiled floor and cried. I watched her shoulders shake up and down. She told me that when Garga went back into the bushes, some of his fellow mujahideen found out about his plan to escape with the Chibok girls. They killed him. Wakil later found out that he had been tortured.Ali Garga’s death was a huge setback to Wakil’s peace talks. Things hadn’t been going her way lately. She had sold many of her assets, including jewellery and land, and had no more money to lure the militants away from the group. Her talks kept hitting dead ends. Her informants were getting killed as they travelled between Maiduguri and the bush, where the militants were based. She never knew who did the killing. Periodically, she would get a message that another contact had been killed by a stray bullet, or drowned in a river.In late 2019, her foundation was hit with a lawsuit over allegations of fraud. She was detained shortly afterwards. According to the government’s anti-corruption agency, contractors who had supplied at least 111.6m naira (£229,000) worth of goods such as cars, maize and medical supplies to the foundation had not been paid and some of the awarded contracts were bogus.In January, I travelled to Maiduguri to see if I could visit Wakil in the prison where she and the foundation’s programme manager and country director were being held. I learned that the prison administrators had allowed her to go to the hospital to get treatment for her high blood pressure. At the hospital, Wakil told me she was innocent, blaming everything on the programme manager, who had handled the contracts. (Like Wakil, the programme manager and country director have also pleaded not guilty. The trial has been postponed until further notice, and all three suspects remain in custody.)Meanwhile, Wakil told me, the number of people joining Boko Haram was growing, despite the Nigerian military’s claims to the contrary. They were getting their hands on more sophisticated weapons: Russian anti-aircraft missiles and mortars that had been circulating in north Africa since the fall of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, as well as drones. And then there were all the Boko Haram splinter groups, which made it harder for Wakil to keep track of which faction was carrying out which attack.Despite the presence of a multinational task force of specially trained army units, and repeated claims by Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that the group has been “technically defeated”, its insurgency continues. In March, the Chadian and Nigerian armies kicked off a major offensive operation against Boko Haram. Later that month, 92 Chadian soldiers were killed in a battle that lasted seven hours. Chadian forces claimed they killed 1,000 militants in a mission launched that month. In June, militants carried out multiple attacks in north-eastern Nigeria, which left scores of civilians dead.It’s hard to say who is winning the war, but Wakil’s boys are dying before they can even surrender. A couple of days after Ali Garga was killed, Wakil called me into her bedroom to watch old videos of him. It was night-time, and I sat on the fluffy pink comforter beside Wakil, and looked at the tablet in her hands. There, on the screen, were Garga and his wife, a rifle slung over her shoulder. They were dancing in a clearing of trees. All around them, sword-carrying mujahideen danced with women, standing shoulder to shoulder, shuffling back and forth. Everyone was beaming. Under a bright sky, Boko Haram was dancing.I looked up from the tablet and saw Wakil smile as she watched her son. I remembered something she had told me one evening in her kitchen. All she wanted, she said, was for her boys to come out, so she could cook isi ewu for them and they could eat together like old times. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/848b467a1ef64f0dd4c3bd881ba5c2394a9a3ea5/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab65e84b42faa997536591eb5a6db4d","title":"outdoor theatre and music can restart in england from 11 july","story":"Industry welcomes news but calls for clarity on when indoor performances can returnTheatres and music venues in England will be able to host physically distanced outdoor performances from Saturday 11 July under new government guidance, but industry figures are calling for more clarity on when full-capacity indoor performances can return.The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, announced the relaxing of restrictions at Thursday’s 5pm press conference where he said performances can now take place as long as they are “outside and with a limited and socially distanced audience”.“As I’ve seen for myself at the Royal Academy this morning, the National Gallery and as we’ll see shortly from the National Museums Liverpool, our cultural institutions are beginning to welcome back visitors,” he said.“I’m really urging people to get out there and to play their part, buy the tickets for outdoor plays and music recitals, get to your local gallery and support your local businesses.”The government said that now “gives the green light” for outdoor opera at Glyndebourne, and outdoor theatre at venues such as the Minack Theatre and Shakespeare’s Globe, but industry figures were disappointed that the announcement did not go further. Earlier in the week, Dowden unveiled a £1.57bn rescue package for the arts industry.Jon Morgan, director of Theatres Trust, welcomed the relaxation but called for more clarity on when theatres can move to stage five of the government’s “roadmap”, when performances are allowed indoors with audiences.He said: “It is disappointing that the guidelines have been published without a ‘not before’ date for stage four and the all-important stage five – the point when theatres will be able to open fully and welcome back audiences without social distancing.”Dowden said that pilot performances are taking place in venues to assess when indoor performances can return, which is vital for theatres that need to be almost at full capacity to make a profit and justify the cost of reopening.The announcement comes after Britain’s struggling arts and heritage sectors was promised £1.57bn in a rescue package, which the government claimed was the biggest ever one-off investment in UK culture.Dowden also said that the government was changing planning rules in order to prevent vacant theatres from being demolished or changed for other uses. “Our culture, heritage and arts are too precious to lose. That’s why we’re protecting venues like theatres from redevelopment if they fall on hard times,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

Morocco has extended an emergency decree until 10 August giving local authorities leeway in taking restrictive measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The cabinet maintained the decree in force to allow for restoring lockdowns on a region-by-region basis depending on the coronavirus developments.Morocco has unlocked most of the economy since 25 June, allowing cafes, restaurants, sports clubs and other services and entertainment businesses to resume activity at half capacity, except in the provinces where infections remain higher such as Tangier, Marrakech and Safi.Domestic travel has resumed, while borders are set to reopen on 14 July to nationals in addition to foreign residents and their families.By Thursday evening, Morocco had recorded 15,079 cases, including 242 deaths and 11,447 recoveries with total tests rising to 835,264.Global wildlife monitoring needs to be stepped up to reduce the risk of future pandemics, experts have warned.Scientists from the Wildlife Disease Surveillance Focus Group want improvements on the testing and tracking of organisms that cause disease, known as pathogens, in wildlife to help avoid another worldwide outbreak.Previous outbreaks of new diseases such as SARS and MERS were caused by the crossover of pathogens from animals to humans. SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for Covid-19, is thought to have originated in bats and moved into other wildlife hosts before crossing over into humans.The lack of knowledge about how the step between animals and humans happened highlights the need for improved surveillance, the group said.To avoid a repeat of Covid-19, wildlife must be tested closer to areas of risk, better use should be made of technology and greater oversight introduced for the international wildlife trade, the group said in an article published in the journal Science.Currently, there is no wildlife trade pathogen screening, including of animals or their products that are eaten, transported or hunted as game.It outlines recommendations including an increase in laboratory testing capacity at or near locations where humans and wildlife interact.The Africa Centres for Disease Control has said that member states must carry out more coronavirus testing and impose mandatory use of masks, as the number of cases across the continent passed 500,000, according to Reuters. “The pandemic is gaining full momentum,” John Nkengasong, head of the Africa CDC, told a virtual news briefing from Addis Ababa. He said African countries, many of which do not have reliable data, must adopt an aggressive approach to encourage the wearing of face masks and ramp up testing and tracing.“This will save lives and save (the) economy.”The African Union commission said on Thursday it had launched a consortium for vaccine clinical trials to be headed by the Africa CDC, which aimed to secure more than 10 late stage vaccine clinical trials as early as possible.South Africa and Egypt are already running human trials for a potential vaccine.A dozen countries including the US, UK and Singapore agreed on Thursday to speed up efforts to get hundreds of thousands of stranded merchant sailors home after they had been at sea for many months due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Reuters.  Some 200,000 seafarers are affected, with Covid-19 travel restrictions making it almost impossible to rotate crews, according to the UN’s International Maritime Organization. Many have been at sea for longer than an 11-month limit laid out in a maritime labour convention  Shipping industry officials say many sailors are at breaking point, in a situation the United Nations has described as a “humanitarian crisis”. Maritime welfare charities have warned of an increase in suicides.  In a virtual summit hosted by the UK, representatives agreed to open up foreign borders for seafarers and increase the number of commercial flights to speed up repatriation efforts, a UK government statement said. They also committed to designate seafarers as “key workers” and encouraged other countries to follow.  Guy Platten, secretary-general of the International Chamber of Shipping association, said the countries who had agreed to open up borders must now act on their commitments.  “Governments must now use this summit as a catalyst to implement the solutions the shipping industry has provided, applying the political will needed to put them into practice,” he said. Greek authorities say they are ready to re-impose public and travel restrictions next week, warning that safety guidance for the coronavirus is being frequently flouted, the Associated Press reports.Stelios Petsas, the government spokesman, said authorities were “determined to protect the majority from the frivolous few,” adding that the government was likely to announce new restrictions if needed on Monday.Greece, which imposed strict lockdown measures, has kept infection rates low. But cases have crept up since restrictions were lifted and international travel resumed in recent weeks.Petsas said authorities were focused on the rising number of cases in nearby Balkan countries and tourists who travelled to Greece over the land border with Bulgaria, at the single crossing point that has been opened to non-essential travel.The PGA Tour has deployed its first Covid-19 threeball after confirming a trio of players who returned positive tests would remain in the field for the Workday Charity Open, writes Ewan Murray for the ’s sports desk.The Tour has cited guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as key to allowing Dylan Frittelli, Denny McCarthy and Nick Watney to play in Ohio but the move is known to have raised eyebrows among fellow competitors. Late on Wednesday evening, just hours before round one was due to get under way, Frittelli, McCarthy and Watney were removed from their existing tee groupings and placed together.In a statement, the Tour confirmed: Dylan Frittelli, Denny McCarthy and Nick Watney will follow the symptom-based model, as they have continued to return positive tests but meet the CDC guidelines for return to work.The Tour’s medical advisers and the CDC have indicated that PCR tests have shown a possibility of detecting viral RNA even after the infectious virus is no longer present. This would potentially become a persistent positive test result, despite the inidual not being contagious.Out of an abundance of caution, however, any player or caddie who meets the above criteria but continues to return a positive Covid-19 test will either compete as a single in competition or be grouped with players under the same situation, and he will also have no access to indoor facilities on site.Officials in South Africa were trying to calm fears over the coronavirus outbreak after the country’s most-populated province said it was ready to bury more than a million people, AFP reports. Excavators have this week sprung into action to dig long rows of graves in cemeteries throughout Gauteng, which includes the cities of Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria, for possible mass burials. After inspecting cemeteries in Pretoria, the provincial head of health, Bandile Masuku, said on Wednesday that Gauteng was preparing over 1.5m graves.“All our municipalities have been putting up capacity and acquiring more in terms of the land that they’ll need for burial,” Masuku said. His announcement triggered a wave of anxiety in the province, which has so far recorded 75,015 coronavirus cases and 478 deaths, overtaking the Western Cape province as the centre of the virus in South Africa. Authorities have since been scrambling to ease public fears that the province could see such an explosion in coronavirus-related deaths.“The province does not have over a million already open, dug graves,” the provincial health department said in a statement released on Thursday. After the easing of a strict lockdown imposed in late March, the tally of coronavirus contaminations and deaths has begun to rise. More than 8,800 cases and 100 deaths were recorded on Wednesday. With more than 220,000 total infections and 3,600 deaths, South Africa is the most-affected country on the continent.“The storm that we have consistently warned South Africans about is now arriving,” the health minister, Zweli Mkhize, told parliament on Wednesday.“We are now at a point where it’s our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, close friends and comrades that are infected,” he said. Despite field hospitals deployed by the military or NGOs, “bed capacity is still expected to be breached or overwhelmed in all the provinces”, Mkhize said. Hundreds of coronavirus patients in Romania have discharged themselves from hospital after a court ruling that mandatory admittance of those with no or mild symptoms was a breach of human rights, according to AFP. A total of 624 patients, who tested positive for the virus, had asked to leave hospital and now risked transmitting the disease in their communities, the health minister, Nelu Tataru, said on television on Wednesday evening.Tataru also said that more than half of 50,000 people, undergoing mandatory self-isolation after returning from abroad, had left their homes in defiance of doctors’ recommendations. His announcements come as Romania, one of the EU’s poorest members, reported 614 new infections on Thursday, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic started. The total number of infections in the country of some 20 million people reached 30,789, while 1,834 people have died. Romania had so far escaped the brunt of the health crisis while enforcing a two-months lockdown until mid-May and strict mandatory quarantine rules. But in a decision, which came into force last week, the Constitutional court ruled that hospitalising and quarantining people without or with just mild Covid-19 symptoms violated fundamental rights and so could not be imposed by a government decree. Trying to reverse the consequences of the court ruling, the liberal government has proposed new legislation to more clearly spell out when people must be hospitalised or quarantine themselves at home. Lawmakers are scheduled to vote on the legislation later Thursday. Health authorities in Denmark have recommended that people wear face masks in certain circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. “Masks can be used to protect others in certain situations, when other tools to prevent the spread are not enough,” the deputy director of the Danish health authority, Helene Probst, said in a statement.Situations in which the wearing of face masks is now recommended include hospital visits for virus testing, transport from a risk area to an airport and when caring for relatives with Covid-19. “Our most important recommendation is that if you are infected or could be infected with Covid-19 you should isolate yourself,” Probst added. However, the health authority maintains that the most effective measures in curbing the spread are still isolating those infected, social distancing and scrupulous hygiene routines. Denmark, which was one of the first countries in Europe to impose semi-confinement and also the first to reopen its schools, has received praise for its management of the crisis. Its strict coronavirus laws include a provision for mandatory vaccinations and prosecutions for people who refuse to be tested for the virus. The NGO Médecins Sans Frontières is warning that the health system in El Salvador is in the brink of collapse as a result of added pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. In a press release on Thursday, the international health organisation said an increasing number of people of people in the country were dying from Covid-19 and other illnesses at home before they could receive medical care.Luis Romero Pineda, MSF project coordinator in El Salvador, said increasing numbers of people were dying before ambulances could reach them. “Admitting patients to hospitals has also become more difficult,” he said. “Worryingly, community leaders are reporting deaths in their communities, some of them related to the suspension of primary health care.”The Salvadorian government declared a state of emergency on 20 March, suspending primary care services and imposing an absolute lockdown. Movement restrictions have since been lifted but outpatient consultations at hospitals and health units remain suspended, MSF said.The coronavirus pandemic is being used as a pretext for a crackdown on human rights and environment activists in Cambodia, two leading watchdogs have said, according to AFP. Rights activists, labour leaders and journalists have all faced increased violence, intimidation, detention and judicial harassment in the southeast Asian nation since a crackdown was launched ahead of the July 2018 general election, a new report said.“Since March 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic provided the government with a set of additional arguments and tools to further crack down on dissent in Cambodia,” said the report by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). A new law drawn up in the context of Covid-19 and promulgated on 29 April allows the government to declare a state of emergency whenever Cambodia faces “danger” and “a great risk” such as a pandemic.The law’s terms are “ill-defined” and give the government sweeping powers to restrict movement, rights to freedom of expression and association as soon as the state deems a situation “dangerous”, the report said. Cambodia has not released updated statistics on its coronavirus outbreak since 28 June, according to the Worldometers website, which tallies official data from around the world. So far the country has reported 141 cases of coronavirus and no deaths. Cambodia’s law on the State of Emergency “risks violating the right to privacy, silencing free speech and criminalising peaceful assembly,” the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia said on 17 April.Rights group Human Rights Watch last month also accused authorities of using the pandemic as a pretext to arrest opposition supporters and critics who had questioned the government’s handling of the coronavirus. “The accusations of fake news linked to the pandemic have increased in recent months. More than 40 people have been arrested since the beginning of the pandemic for posts related to posts on Covid-19,” said Hugo Gabbero, who coordinated the FIDH and OMCT report. “The accusation of fake news silences all criticism, particularly through arrests which create ripple effect of fear through the rest of civil society,” Gabbero told AFP. He asked the international community to apply pressure to the Cambodian government to ensure the law isn’t applied.’s video team has prepared this video report of the protests taking place in Belgrade over the past two nights.

The Press Association reports: Richard Darwin, chief executive of The Gym Group - which runs 179 gyms across the UK, said he was “delighted” by the announcement:Reopening gyms is an important step forward for the physical and mental wellbeing of our members and millions of other gym goers, and we can’t wait to welcome them all back.We are really confident our new procedures will ensure that we can operate safely, with distanced equipment, enhanced cleaning and our busyness tracker to help manage the number of people in the gym.Duncan Bannatyne, owner of health club and spa firm Bannatyne Group and star of Dragon’s Den, said: I am incredibly pleased that we have a definite date for reopening our 57 health clubs in England.The fitness sector is vitally important, both for the nation’s health and the economy.In my discussions with ministers over the last week or so, I was gratified that they understood that the majority of health clubs could reopen safely and that it was essential to do so.The Feel Good Group, which runs 90 tanning salons across the UK, welcomed the Government’s decision to allow its shops to reopen on July 13, but said they should be able to reopen immediately.Adam Mooney, founder and chief executive, said: While we welcome the decision to finally allow us to reopen, the Government could have allowed us to open last week, when hairdressers reopened.We are ready to reopen today, not next week.Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said: It’s good news to see the Government announce the reopening of thousands more small firms across England.Beauticians, nail salons, gyms and the wider fitness sector have faced months without customers, and they’ll be pleased to see that they can finally get back to business.An autumn series of exams for pupils in England who want to try to improve on the calculated grades they receive in the summer for their GCSEs and A-levels will be held over six weeks beginning in October, it has been confirmed.The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), which represents the exam boards, said AS and A-levels would be held first, beginning on 5 October. GCSEs will follow, starting on 2 November, running for three weeks. Exams will be available in all subjects.The summer exams were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic and pupils will instead receive grades based on teacher assessment, a pupil’s ranking within their class in a particular subject, and prior attainment of both the inidual and the school, among other measures.Headteachers have expressed concern about hosting an entire series of exams just as pupils are settling back into school after months of disruption due to the pandemic.Announcing the dates of the autumn series, the JCQ director general, Dr Philip Wright, said: In August, we will be celebrating the success of young people and their progression to the next stage of learning or move into a career. The grades will be reflective of what they might have achieved had they been able to sit their exams and will enable them to move on to the next phase in their lives. The autumn series will be available for young people for whom it was not possible to issue a grade or who wish to improve their grades based on taking an exam. Full details on the autumn series will be available shortly from the exam boards.ITV has interviewed the health secretary Matt Hancock, who has said care homes will open up to visitors “in the next few days”. A further 85 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, bringing the official total number of deaths to 44,602In a few days we will be setting out how Covid secure visiting can happen in care homes.

If people can go to the pub, shouldn’t they be able to get on a train?Dowden says in London lots of people use public transport, but outside of London most people use cars. He says the position remains that people should continue to avoid public transport where necessary. Dowden is asked if face coverings will be required in gyms. He says that in gyms there are a lot of measures set out. The government has not taken the decision to require the wearing of face masks. Dowden says he went to the Royal Academy and wore a face covering. He adds that face covering are context specific, and that is the right way rather than enforcing the wearing of them. Dowden is asked how the government is going to persuade people that it’s worth going back to gyms and swimming pools with all the added regulations (like no butterfly stroke). Dowden says it is better to reopen with restrictions than not to reopen, but says it will take a little time for confidence to come back. He was also asked – by the Express reporter – if the government can force the BBC not to extend the licence fee to over-75s.He says the government regrets the fact the BBC has not kept the licence fee free for the over-75s. Dowden is asked, how are these decisions still based on the science? What data have you seen since Saturday’s reopening to suggest it’s safe to reopen gyms? Dowden says we continue to be informed by the science and gives an example of ensuring social distancing and ventilation. He says there is a rolling programme of reopening, and the government continues to analyse data – which is one reason why the opening of gyms has been delayed. He is asked if the government is confident it is safe according to the data, after a Sage scientist said it might take weeks for the data to emerge. Dowden says all of the data is continuing to move in the right direction. Sky News’s Sam Coates asks if testing people without symptoms is a government goal. Dowden says the government continues to massively “ramp up” testing. He said tens of thousands of people who had been in contact with people who had tested positive for coronavirus are self-isolating as a result of test and trace. Coates repeats the question, which Dowden avoids and says: “We have an effective regime.” Dowden also announced that beauticians, spas, tattooists, and tanning salons can reopen from Monday with “some restrictions” on particularly high risk services. Dowden asked what precautions will be taken in schools in September. We all want to do the best for our children, he says. He said the education secretary and the prime minister would not open if it were not safe. There will be extra cleaning and distancing were possible. Testing will be available for those who have symptoms he says. Dowden is urging British people to “make the most of this summer safely” adding: “We need them to support the places we love.” Dowden has also said that local sports teams can reopen this weekend. Outdoor pools and water parks will open this weekend. But gyms and indoor pools will only be allowed to open from 25 July. Gyms, swimming pools and leisure centres will open later this month in England with social distancing measures after growing unhappiness from the health and fitness sector that pub and restaurant reopening had been prioritised.Culture secretary Oliver Dowden is now taking the Downing Street briefing. Dowden announces that as of this weekend artists musicians and artists can perform live outside to a outdoor socially distanced audience. Outdoor swimming pools will also be opened from 11 July. From the 11 July theatres, opera houses, dance venues and music venues can put on performances for socially distanced performances. British companies will face new barriers selling their products in the European Union, while UK nationals will face “thorough checks” when travelling to the continent even if there is a Brexit trade deal, the European commission has said.In a document warning businesses to prepare for the end of the Brexit transition period, the EU executive said many changes were “inevitable” even if the two sides reached an agreement by the end of the year.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier released the document, after three days of talks with his counterpart David Frost in London, where he said “significant ergences” remained between the two sides.The 35-page document contained a thinly-veiled criticism of the UK government’s decision not to opt for a one or two-year extension of the Brexit transition period. The choices made by the United Kingdom’s government on the future relationship and on not extending the transition period mean that these inevitable disruptions will occur as of 1 January 2021 and risk compounding the pressure that businesses are already under due to the Covid-19 outbreak. It also underscores that Brussels has no intention of phasing in border controls, an approach favoured by the British government. From 1 January 2021, customs officers in EU member states are expected to carry out full controls, which are “ likely to lead to increased administrative burdens for businesses and longer delivery times in logistical supply chains” the commission said. These controls will apply even if the EU and UK are successful in agreeing a trade deal that sets tariffs at zero, with no limits on quantities of exports and imports.As Barnier has long trailed, British financial firms in the City of London will lose the “passports” that allow them to sell services in the rest of the union.As well as losing their right to live, work and travel freely in the 27-country zone, British nationals will also face “thorough checks” at the border and cannot stay for more than 90 days in any 180-day period.Travellers will no longer be assured protection under EU passenger rights law that guarantees some compensation, nor will they have sure access to reduced roaming rates, while cats, dogs and other domestic animals will be stripped of the EU pet passport."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4300300.1594303097!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first ever woman president of an irish university appointed at university of limerick","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInterim president of the University of Limerick Kerstin Mey is the first woman to hold the presidency of an Irish university. Photograph: Sean Curtin True Media.The first ever woman president of an Irish university in the 400-plus years of higher education has been appointed at University of Limerick. Professor Kerstin Mey has been named as interim president of the university for the next 18 months.She will replace outgoing president Dr Des Fitzgerald, who announced his intention to retire in May.The interim president will serve as chief officer of the university until the appointment of a new president through an open international recruitment process.UL’s governing authority ratified the appointment of Prof Mey following a special meeting on Thursday.Chancellor of UL Mary Harney said Prof Mey would be a “great appointee and one in whom we have every faith in to lead the university at a challenging time. She has already demonstrated her capacity for leadership in her role as vice president.” Ms Harney said there has long been a significant gender imbalance at senior leadership level in Irish universities.“It is fitting that UL now has the first female president given our consistent leading position on gender equality in higher education in Ireland, ” she added.Professor Mey, who was appointed vice president and professor of visual culture at UL in April 2018, previously held roles as pro-vice chancellor and dean of the Westminster School of Media, Arts and Design and as professor of contemporary art and theory at the University of Westminster, London. She said she was “proud and really humbled to lead the University of Limerick over the next period”.“It is a significant opportunity and also a huge challenge and I will be aiming to work with all staff, students, governing authority, the communities UL serves, our stakeholders in the city and the region and of course the government to underpin the role that universities will play in the economic recovery as we manage the pandemic,” she said.She said the college will use the next 12-18 months to reassess its strategic plans.“In the very short term, the focus has to be safeguarding the health and safety of our current and incoming students and our staff and the communities we serve and we are working very hard to prepare the campus for a full opening in September,” she said.“UL is a young institution with a pioneering heritage - we aim to seize the opportunity to transform the educational model by working with industries, communities and government. We need to support our graduates to embrace complexity and develop resilience, stimulate their inquisitiveness, imagination and critical reflectiveness so that they are prepared to deal with the significant societal as well as personal challenges ahead,” she added.UL has one of the best records in the higher education sector for gender equality among its senior leadership.There are five female members out of eleven on the university’s executive committee. It also has a female Chancellor, while two of UL’s three vice presidents and three of UL’s five deans are women.Outgoing president Dr Fitzgerald who took up the role of UL president in 2017 announced his resignation from the position in May this year.Dr Fitzgerald said the Covid -19 pandemic would directly impact his ability to serve the university and limit his ability to fully engage in the community upon a return to campus.On his successor he said: “She is an outstanding academic with a strong empathy for students and the academic mission of UL. She has a vision for UL that will place it in a leading position nationally and globally.”Prof Mey was born and raised in east Berlin and studied for an MA equivalent in art, and German language and literature at Humboldt University in Berlin.She completed a PhD in art theory and aesthetics there and has held academic positions in universities in Germany and the UK. Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris welcomed the appointment as a major step forward for gender equality.“This is an historic appointment. I want to state my commitment to the roll-out of the senior academic leadership initiative in higher education set in place by the last Government, to increase the number of women at professor level in our universities,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

People could get on with their activities but they had to do so safely, he said. Non-essential overseas travel should be avoided.DeathsAnother six deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported by the Nphet on Thursday. This brings to 1,743 the total number of deaths from the disease in the Republic.The 23 new confirmed cases of the virus reported on Thursday brings the total number of cases to 25,565.The reproduction number, which measures how many people a confirmed case goes on to infect, has increased to “at or above 1”, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group.However, it is difficult to accurately measure the reproduction number when the number of cases involved is small, as at present, he cautioned.A reproduction number of less than 1 means an epidemic is dying out a figure greater than 1 signals it is spreading.Sounding a “note of caution”, he said there was an “immediate need” for people to take care and caution in their decisions and actions. About 15-20 per cent of cases were travel-related.Case numbers are showing a small increase but other indicators are stable or declining, Prof Nolan said. As a result, Ireland’s 14-day incidence of the disease has risen to four per 100,000 of population.There are currently an average of 14 new cases per day, one hospital admission a day and one ICU admission every five days.The rise in cases is not unexpected as people move about more freely, he said.One out or every five contacts of a confirmed case failed to attend for initial testing on “day 0”, according to Dr Cillian de Gascun, head of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, and almost half failed to go for testing a week later, on “day 7”.Some 64 per cent of deaths occurred in residential care facilities and 57 per cent in nursing homes alone.Over 6,000 tests a day were performed last week, but the positivity rate was just 0.29 per cent.Covid-free countiesMeanwhile, six counties have stayed Covid-19 free over the past week despite a slight increase in cases of the disease.Counties Carlow, Clare, Kerry, Laois, Mayo and Tipperary recorded no new confirmed cases in the week up to last Monday, according to the latest Health Service Executive figures.Counties Donegal, Kilkenny, Longford, Monaghan, Roscommon and Wexford added just one new case, according to the epidemiological report from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre.The biggest increase was in Co Kildare, where 11 further cases were confirmed, followed by Co Dublin with nine. Sligo’s case numbers rose by five due to a travel-related cluster in the county.Overall, the number of cases recorded by the surveillance centre increased by 60, to 25,531.Despite concerns expressed over the past week about foreign travel, so far this route of transmission has had little impact on the official figures. The number of travel-related cases grew by six to 599 over the week and the number of imported cases by six to 391.There are 12 patients with confirmed Covid-19 in hospitals, including nine in intensive care, according to the HSE.The National Public Health Emergency Team is meeting today to review the data on the transmission of the disease.Public health officials are also reviewing the impact of the easing of restrictions over recent months, in particular last week’s loosening of measures that enabled national travel again, along with the opening of restaurants and crèches.WHO Covid-19 chief on IrelandSeparately, the World Health Organisation’s director general for Covid-19, Dr David Nabarro, has said Ireland’s data in relation to the suppression of the virus is promising. But he warned that “a dashboard of indicators” is necessary.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s News at One, he explained that the dashboard includes the ability to isolate and track cases, how well hospitals are stocked and performance of nursing homes.“It’s not just the number of cases, it’s how well prepared you are for a second wave,” he said.The situation in the world is disturbing, said Dr Nabarro. “I am really worried about the next six months.”Dr Nabarro said he found it hard to understand the rationale for US president Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the WHO, especially at such a time.Dr Nabarro also defended the global health organisation’s line on transmission through airborne or aerosol connections. There is not “a bundle of evidence” so it is correct for the organisation to be extra careful. “The implications are absolutely huge,” he added. It is important that the WHO advice “is as good as we can make it”.Meanwhile, the evidence remained that the “vast majority” of transmission was via droplets so keeping the 2m rule is important, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299390.1594237900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people are dying private nursing homes plea for state help","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Tara Winthrop Private Clinic, in Swords, Co Dublin, was one of the first nursing homes in Ireland to experience a Covid-19 outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Two of the nursing homes worst hit by coronavirus appealed directly to then minister for health Simon Harris for help as they fought severe Covid-19 outbreaks in March and April.The private homes – Tara Winthrop in Swords, Co Dublin and Dealgan House in Dundalk, Co Louth – struggled to cope with outbreaks prompting them to make desperate, late-night pleas for help.Newly released emails show the depth of the crisis in some nursing homes, the sector most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic accounting for 985 or 56 per cent of the 1,738 Covid-19 deaths. Joe O’Donovan, chief executive of Tara Winthrop, one of the first nursing homes in Ireland to experience a Covid-19 outbreak, told senior State health officials on the weekend of March 20th-21st the facility “cannot contain the outbreak without support directly on our units” and management at the nursing home “no longer have the resources to manage the outbreak”. The situation reached crisis point at Dealgan House over the Easter weekend in April, when a director warned in an email to the HSE that if the home’s residents were to have “a fighting chance of survival, the home needs to be virtually turned into a hospital”.Both homes recorded multiple cases of coronavirus and deaths related to the disease, running to more than 20 confirmed or suspected Covid-19 deaths at each care facility. A quarter of the residents at Dealgan House died.The appeals for help are contained in emails released by health service regulator, Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA), to The  under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act. The records were redacted of information identifying iniduals and the homes. This newspaper has independently established the identity of the homes and the iniduals in the correspondence.‘Immediate threat’In an email sent at 11.15pm on Friday, March 20th, to HSE officials, Mr O’Donovan said the large Swords home needed an additional 12 staff the following day to cover symptomatic staff calling in sick and 11 staff to cover the shortfall on the Sunday.“I cannot highlight enough the immediate threat…at the home from Covid-19,” he wrote.In addition to the extra staff, Mr O’Donovan appealed for personal protective equipment (PPE), the results of swab tests, swabs for further tests and “one single contact in public health”.He warned that without further supplies of PPE, the home would breach minimum requirements “of the most recent HSE guidance note on PPE”.He had not received a response by the following day so he escalated his concerns. At 1.53pm that Saturday, he forwarded his previous night’s email to the same recipients and this time copied the then minister for health and other Department of Health and HSE senior officials.The situation at the north Co Dublin home “continues to get more serious by the hour” with more staff out sick, he said.Mr O’Donovan referred to a newspaper article published that day reporting then taoiseach Leo Varadkar telling a private Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that in Italy nursing homes residents were not going to the hospital when Covid-19 hit but to the morgue, and that Mr Varadkar did not want that to happen here.“It has and is happening,” Mr O’Donovan wrote in his email that Saturday afternoon.Mr O’Donovan signed off, saying: “Again, I appeal for your immediate attention to this critical situation for a high-risk vulnerable group.”At 5.40pm, he sent a follow-up email expressing relief that “six personnel” had arrived to help and these were “crucial to us containing the outbreak and protecting the residents”.“We no longer feel unheard and unsupported,” he wrote. In a call with a Tara Winthrop staff member the following week, Hiqa noted that it was told that the number of staff calling in sick was increasing daily to the point that the Swords nursing home was “considering asking relatives to come and assist with caring” for the residents they were related to.The crisis was just as grave at Dealgan House when it hit three weeks later, at the Easter weekend.Direct appealFintan Farrelly, one of the home’s owners, emailed the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan late on April 11th saying he would not normally make a request “through this channel” but “as it is Easter Saturday and the situation is so urgent, I’m appealing directly to you”.“In our nursing home, people are dying and we are struggling terribly with staff absences. Many of these staff were tested weeks ago and have had no result,” he wrote.The privately owned nursing home did not know which residents were infected until they had symptoms and that “in a number of cases, the residents have passed away within hours of showing the first symptoms”, he said. They “desperately” needed mass testing of all staff and residents with next-day results, he told Dr Holohan, “so that we can get a clear picture of the situation and get the outbreak under control”.Mr Farrelly alerted Mr Harris to his concerns the next day, telling the then minister for health in an email at 8.47pm on Easter Sunday that the nursing home required extra nurses from the HSE to work day and night shifts.“I fear that when the history of Ireland’s Covid-19 pandemic is written, the failure to adequately support nursing homes during the month of March and up to the current time, will have resulted in multiple avoidable deaths and will be identified as the greatest tragedy of the pandemic,” he wrote. “We are said to be ‘all in this together’ but we feel strongly that Ireland’s most vulnerable and concentrated group, the over 25,000 residents of our nursing homes, have been and continue to be neglected by your department and the HSE. We cherish our elderly people and feel they are being badly let down by the State.” The staff had been “decimated”, he wrote, and said some who were self-isolating had not received test results, so they could in fact be “unnecessarily absent from work, thus exacerbating desperate staff shortage”.“It was not our experience that healthcare workers were prioritised for testing and it appears that prioritisation only applied to the HSE,” he wrote. Mr Farrelly said the home was desperately short of nurses “and on occasion have only had one nurse on night duty, dealing with 80 residents, some of whom are very ill”.“Our experience is that the support promised from the HSE is not forthcoming and I ask you why not?” he said in his email to the minister.‘Dire straits’Mr Farrelly said he was “very disturbed” to hear that while Dealgan was “in dire straits and our residents are dying” a local hospital in Co Louth was “practically empty of patients and is fully staffed” and nurses were told to take leave “due to an insufficient workload” and “will be called if necessary”.“This beggars belief!” he wrote.On Monday, April 13th, Mr Farrelly emailed a HSE official with a long list of what the home required, including nurses and healthcare workers. Dealgan’s residents “deserve a chance to fight this virus” at the home, he said, and the only alternative was to sent them to a local hospital.“This is not our wish nor that of families, nor I’m sure that of the HSE,” he wrote. Four days later, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Hospitals Group stepped in and temporarily took over the management of the Co Louth nursing home. A spokesman for Dealgan House said this week the Covid-19 outbreak was closed and they had not had a new outbreak since May. The 84-bed capacity home had 22 Covid-19 deaths. Tara Winthrop said on Wednesday that it had 18 confirmed and five suspected Covid deaths at the facility, which has 140 beds. A spokesman for the home said a further five asymptomatic staff tested positive two weeks ago as part of the HSE’s weekly testing of all nursing home staff but they had isolated, recovered and returned to work. All residents subsequently tested negative, he added.The spokesman said close liaison with Mr Harris, his department and the HSE from March “enabled learnings from this experience to inform and improve the measures taken subsequently to help cope with outbreaks across the nursing home sector”.He said the Swords nursing home was “working tirelessly to protect the residents and the staff and continue to work, on a daily basis, with the experts in the HSE, Department of Health and Hiqa to fight this virus”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Six further deaths reported and 23 new cases as reproduction rate \u0026lsquoat or above one\u0026rsquoMore people now seeking help for cocaine addiction than cannabisLetter to football association prompted by \u0026lsquoalarming reports\u0026rsquo of boardroom splitMan used wheelchair when attending appointments about claim but did not need one in day to day lifePlans for extra footpath space and cycling lane will provide \u0026lsquofacelift\u0026rsquo for main streetFBI agent contacted Yahoo who determined the email address was located in IrelandCo Donegal seminar on topical issues will debate Irish and world response to pandemicCountries included in exemption will be the same as those in England and WalesAaron Brady denies murdering Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe during armed raidDepartment of Housing sends circular to local authorities on Rebuilding Ireland loanCharity uses \u0026lsquofake mothers\u0026rsquo made from old wetsuits to comfort the pups in intensive careMr Justice Charlies Meenan welcomes settlement and strikes out proceedingsMan claims former partner brought horses, one pre-selected for Olympic Games, to Waterford so they would be beyond his reachIrish in Australia batten down hatches for second phase of mass action against Covid-19\u0026lsquoThere is one question in the minds of the family, could we not have them back?\u0026rsquoTemporary court order granted preventing identification of the accused manProfessor Kerstin Mey has been named as interim president for the next 18 monthsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4300405.1594312217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid wage subsidy recipients cannot draw down funds from state mortgage scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile people on the temporary wage subsidy scheme can apply for a loan, when they are approved draw down would not commence until the applicants’ unsupported income post TWSS has returned. People using a State-backed mortgage scheme will not be able to draw down funds if they are in receipt of Covid-era wage subsidies, the Department of Housing has confirmed.In response to a parliamentary question asked by Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien confirmed his department had sent a circular to local authorities, which administer the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme, on Monday.While people on the temporary wage subsidy scheme (TWSS) can apply for a loan, when they are approved “draw down would not commence until the applicants’ unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months”.He said that local authorities can “use their judgment and knowledge of local employers to advance loans” in advance of this three-month period, when appropriate. Applicants can also draw down a loan if a joint application is being made, and one party is not on the state subsidy and can also show repayment capacity based on their income alone.When someone’s wages are cut after the subsidy is withdrawn, their application will be re-assessed “to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them”, Mr O’Brien said.Prudence“This approach is in line with the need to lend on a prudent basis, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment and it would not be appropriate to lend when there is a risk that the person’s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested,” the Dublin Fingal TD said. He said what was in place did not amount to a “blanket ban”, and said “there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the inidual circumstances”.However, Mr Ó Broin insisted that the circular, which was sent to local authorities on Monday, amounted to a blanket ban for those in receipt of subsidies.“When you read the thing it’s very clear that anyone who has approval in principle cannot draw down until they’re three months off (the subsidy scheme).” He criticised Mr O’Brien, who said in the Dáil on Wednesday that no blanket ban was in place.“This is exactly the same type of blanket ban that AIB introduced and were hauled over the coals for,” he said. “The parliamentary question is crystal clear. The Minister needs to formally correct the record of the Dáil.”The Sinn Féin deputy said he would be writing to the Ceann Comhairle requesting the record be corrected.A spokesman for the Department of Housing said local authorities can use their judgment to advance loans ahead of the three month period.“The approach outlined in the circular is in line with the need to lend on a prudent basis.”Return to workMeanwhile, the Government has reported the highest number of people returning to work in a single week since the coronavirus pandemic began with 63,000 coming off the State Covid-19 jobless payments.Liz Canavan, assistant secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach, said at a briefing on that 412,900 people received a Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, down from 439,000 last week and a high of 598,000 who had received this payment.Revenue made payments of almost €24.5 million this week under the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme to employers, bringing total payment sunders his scheme to €1.97 billion, she said.

This is a war on workers, and it is time for workers to fight back.”On Facebook she described Mr Justice Garrett Simons as a “right-wing judge”.Mr Flanagan said he believed the People Before Profit TD was “waging something of a campaign” on social media, and called on the Ceann Comhairle to “take the appropriate steps”.Following an initial consideration of the matter, the committee agreed on Thursday that the complaint was not vexatious and merited further investigation.It is understood Ms Smith will be given an opportunity to respond over the coming weeks.She said that she will be examining the record of the Dáil to determine if any other TDs have similarly criticised the judiciary and would continue to defend her stance to the committee.The Association of Judges of Ireland previously issued a statement criticising Ms Smith and her response to the judgment by Mr Justice Garrett Simons of the High Court, who ruled that the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 was unconstitutional.In a previous letter to Ms Smith, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said “the fundamental constitutional principle of the separation of powers mandates mutual respect between branches of Government. This obligation extends to Members when making utterances on the floor of the House.”After referring to the rules and codes of conduct of the Oireachtas, he said the rulings of the chair “acknowledge the independence of the judiciary and prohibit Members from making a charge against, or discussing the conduct or actions of judges or their decisions”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Mayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4300032.1594282604!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus melbourne begins six week lockdown after virus spike","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Melbourne Fire Brigade (MFB) prepare to take food parcels to residents in a locked down public housing estate in Melbourne. Photograph: William WestAFP via GettyMelbourne began a six-week lockdown on Thursday following a spike in new coronavirus cases, as states around the country tightened internal borders to prevent a second wave sweeping the country.Australia has avoided the high casualty numbers of other countries to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed 544,055 people globally, but an outbreak in Australia’s second most populous city prompted the state of Victoria to impose “self isolate” orders for the city’s estimated five million.Victoria on Thursday reported 165 new infections have been detected in the last 24 hours, an increase on the previous day’s 134 cases.Other states and territories have recorded few or zero cases in recent weeks and are continuing to reopen their economies, but Australian prime minister Scott Morrison told residents not to become complacent.“We must continue to follow those social distancing protocols all around Australia, even in states or territories where the number of cases is effectively zero,” Mr Morrison told reporters in Canberra. The northern state of Queensland said it would ban non-residents arriving from Victoria. It will open its borders to people from other states and territories on Friday.Even people travelling from Victoria who were willing to pay for the mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine would be banned, the Queensland government said.“They are making the decision that that two weeks and that cost is worth it to get out of Victoria,” deputy premier Stephen Miles said in a televised news conference.“We don’t want that to continue,” he added.The country’s most populous state, New South Wales, closed its heavily trafficked border to neighbouring Victoria on Wednesday. South Australia also closed its border with Victoria.It came as the number of cases worldwide passed 12 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. CataloniaAll residents and visitors in Catalonia must wear face masks in public at all times, becoming the first Spanish region to toughen a national directive mandating their use when in close proximity to others.The order was announced by regional leader Quim Torra four days after more than 200,000 people in the Segria area were placed under a local lockdown following a series of coronavirus outbreaks there.“Masks will be mandatory all over Catalonia, not just in the Segria region... I think it’s an important measure,” Torra told the regional parliament. “We will distribute protective equipment.”Another Spanish region took a similar decision shortly afterwards. Authorities in the Basque Country made masks mandatory regardless of the distance between people in the small town of Ordizia, where another cluster of nearly 50 cases has been detected, said the region’s health counsellor.Spanish authorities last month made wearing masks compulsory indoors and outdoors in all circumstances in which 1.5 metres (5ft) of social distancing could not be maintained, and until a coronavirus cure or vaccine is found.Torra’s order removed that social distancing exception for Catalonia, making masks compulsory in all social situations.The tougher measure aims to stave off a relaxation in attitudes towards the virus observed among some citizens, officials said.Masks will be mandatory in Catalonia for people above six years old outdoors and in any indoors space open to the public regardless of the physical distance between people, regional government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo told a press briefing.Breaking this obligation will result in a €100 fine, she added.The pandemic has hit Spain harder than most other European countries, causing more than 28,000 deaths and close to 270,000 infections, according to official data.In Italy, also badly affected, the same strict mask-wearing rules are in effect until July 14th in regional Covid-19 epicentre Lombardy. Elsewhere in the country, wearing masks is not obligatory outside for those who can keep a safe distance from others.IndiaIndia has reported nearly 25,000 new coronavirus infections as the disease continues to spread through the nation of nearly 1.4 billion people.The virus is showing no signs of slowing in the worst-affected countries — the United States, Brazil and India.The three nations account for more than 60 per cent of new cases, according to recent tallies from Johns Hopkins University.In India, where the death toll has risen above 21,000, research by the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai shows that the reproduction rate of the virus ticked up in the first week of July to about 1.2 after it had steadily fallen from a peak of 1.8 in March.The rate needs to be below one for new cases to start falling. Health experts say the true extent of the virus’s spread in India is unknown and that the country must test more given its enormous population.The US reported nearly 59,000 new daily cases, just short of the record 60,000 cases set a day earlier, as President Donald Trump insisted that schools reopen in the autumn.Brazil reported nearly 45,000 new cases.The virus has also been spreading rapidly in South Africa, which reported nearly 9,000 new cases in its latest daily update.A provincial health official said 1.5 million graves are being prepared and it is the public’s responsibility “to make sure that we don’t get there”.In the US, the number of confirmed cases has passed 3 million — meaning nearly one in every 100 people has been confirmed as infected — and the number of deaths is more than 132,000.But Mr Trump remains determined to reopen America’s schools despite worries about the virus, and on Wednesday threatened to hold back federal money if school districts do not bring their students back in the autumn.He complained that his own public health officials’ safety guidelines are impractical and too expensive.JapanTokyo reported more than 220 coronavirus cases on Thursday, a record for a single day, even as officials continued to assert that a state of emergency is not necessary.Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said that increased testing had led to the surge, with authorities encouraging night-time businesses such as host and hostess bars to voluntarily test their staff.Nonetheless, while small in comparison to some global cities, the number came as a shock after the figure had dropped below 100 on Wednesday for the first time in a week. Officials have argued that the recent spike in cases is different from back in April, as the bulk of the infections are from those in their 20s and 30s who are less likely to fall severely ill.New ZealandPolice officers will patrol New Zealand’s quarantine hotels around-the-clock after a number of people – including a man who tested positive for coronavirus – escaped the managed isolation facilities.In two separate incidents in Auckland hotels guests in isolation left their quarantine hotels, with one woman escaping over a hedge, and another man over a small fence.The 32-year-old man – who was away for 70 minutes and visited a busy inner-city supermarket – tested positive for Covid-19.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

It is not just that they require an enormous dose of centralised, government intervention, policies that are anathema to small-statists in ordinary times. An even greater problem is that central planning and huge expansions in welfare are extraordinarily addictive.“Temporary” programmes have a horrible tendency of becoming the new normal, which is why major shocks usually do more to advance socialism than Left-wing election victories or the scribbling of ideologues, as FA Hayek once noted. It is incumbent upon libertarians to help devise workable, politically possible, incremental solutions that allow countries to rediscover economic freedom when a calamity ends.It is hard to undiscover the magic money tree once its existence has been acknowledged the public’s mindset can shift quickly when they begin to enjoy “free money”, and the “losers” from any attempt at unwinding emergency expenditure tend to shout more loudly than the “winners” (in the form of taxpayers). This has plagued and ruined Conservative governments throughout history, forcing many to pursue proto-socialist policies: even before the virus hit, the tax burden in Britain had hit a multi-decade high.Rishi Sunak, to his great credit, understands this. He was forced to spend in a gargantuan way during the first phase of the crisis, insuring the entire economy against the fastest and largest recession in centuries, but he is determined not to allow coronavirus to usher in a permanent Milibandite settlement. He also doesn’t want to fall into the trap of dismissing the scourge of unemployment, as a few Tories once did: the only question is one of means, not ends. Do we want markets to help us out during the next phase of the fight against the virus, or do we want socialism?His speech on Wednesday is best understood as the first stage in his attempt at charting a conservative, freeish-market route out of lockdown, fighting to create jobs in extremely difficult circumstances. He wants to unwind command and control, and replace it with a more bottom-up form of assistance. He is still intervening in an extreme way – any Chancellor would be at this stage – but is trying to shift and time-limit support in a manner that doesn’t attempt to buck market forces.Sunak’s biggest decision was to end furlough in October, rather than delaying it endlessly, as the likes of Spain have done. While he believes in the “nobility of work”, there is no point in giving people “false hope” by propping up doomed jobs forever. Encouragingly, he is no supporter of Franklin D Roosevelt’s economics.Instead of replacing furlough with massive public sector make-work schemes – the apocryphal example involves paying people to uselessly dig holes before filling them up again – he is trying to support the private sector by cutting the cost of employing staff, helping workers retrain and turbocharging the housing market.His Kickstart scheme may or may not work, but it’s better to subsidise getting young people into employment or training than adding them to the public sector payroll. Ditto traineeships and apprenticeships. The danger here is that the unemployment crisis is shifted to older workers.There are also at least two upsides to “eat out to help out”. It will infuriate the authoritarian health fanatics who hate the idea of people enjoying cheap food, while showing that the Tories care about self-made, often immigrant entrepreneurs. It acknowledges that many restaurants will go bust, but empowers consumers to choose which survive. The policy is therefore far more pro-market than simply subsidising all restaurants equally.The same is true of his “green jobs”. If one is going down that route, better to allow consumers to choose their own projects and providers the command and control solution would be for the state to spend everything itself. These “green” jobs are normal jobs, and the beneficiaries – suburban homeowners and double glazing fitters – part of Johnson’s Tory coalition.The question, of course, is what next. Sunak’s Autumn Budget will need to be a blockbuster. It will need to include genuine deregulatory initiatives and further tax cuts. It was reassuring to hear Boris Johnson earlier decrying the opposition’s call for a wealth tax, and the PM’s new slogan contrasting the Tory “jobs, jobs, jobs” to what he described as Labour’s “tax, tax, tax.”As they face a tsunami of economic pain over the next few months, the Tories must remember that no country has ever taxed itself back to full employment. Free markets work collectivism doesn’t.  Sunak\u0027s statement was a good first step his next challenge will be to unleash an entrepreneurial revolution to create the millions of genuine, unsubsidised jobs Britain will be crying out for.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc free tv licence over 75s means tested","story":"The free TV licence for over-75s will be means-tested from August 1, the BBC has said.The BBC has said it will begin its new scheme covering the over-75s licence fee concession on August 1.BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said: The decision to commence the new scheme in August has not been easy, but implementation of the new scheme will be Covid-19 safe.

I believe continuing to fund some free TV licences is the fairest decision for the public, as we will be supporting the poorest oldest pensioners without impacting the programmes and services that all audiences love.The BBC agreed to take on responsibility for funding the scheme as part of the charter agreement hammered out with the Government in 2015.The BBC had postponed its plans to charge over-75s for the licence fee for two months due to the coronavirus outbreak.It is considered crucial that pensioners can continue to access coronavirus updates via BBC News reports.At the time, millions of pensioners had begun receiving letters telling them that they must pay the £157.50 fee from June.But the BBC announced in a joint statement with the Government that free licences would continue until August, when the situation w be reviewed.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mini budget 2020 quick guide everything need know","story":"There were eye-catching cash giveaways, but the primary aim of Rishi Sunak\u0027s mini-Budget was to avert the danger of mass unemployment as a result of the deepest recession in generations.Mr Sunak said his measures would protect millions of jobs and create hundreds of thousands more.The Chancellor said avoiding “significant” job losses was “the most urgent challenge we now face” and despite Wednesday’s measures taking the total spent on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic to £188 billion, “the job has only just begun”.♦ 50 per cent off all restaurant meals from Mondays to Wednesdays in August, capped at £10 per head (cost: £500 million)♦ VAT cut from 20 per cent to 5 per cent on hospitality, accommodation and attractions (£4.1 billion)♦ Zero Stamp Duty on first £500,000 of cost of main homes until March 31 (£3.8 billion)♦ Grants for energy-saving improvements to homes, plus funding to make public buildings and social housing more energy efficient (£3.1 billion)♦ Firms paid £1,000 bonus for every furloughed employee still in work on January 31 (up to £9.4 billion)♦ Kick-start scheme to pay wages of new hires aged 16-24 for six months, with money for apprenticeships (£3.7 billion)♦ Infrastructure projects brought forward to stimulate growth (£5.6 billion)Here are the key details of Rishi Sunak\u0027s mini-Budget:VAT in restaurants, hotels and cinemas will be cut from 20 per cent to five per cent in a bid to protect 2.4 million jobs. Mr Sunak announced the tax cut to give businesses in the hospitality and leisure sector confidence that the demand will be there as they reopen their doors.From July 15 until January 12, VAT on food, accommodation and attractions will be charged at five per cent. The measure will cost an estimated £4.1 billion.Stamp duty has been accused of slowing down the property market and discouraging people from buying homes.Reducing stamp duty makes it cheaper to purchase properties.So Mr Sunak has temporarily loosened the rules on stamp duty and offered exemptions to buyers.Those buying properties worth £500,000 or less will pay no tax, while those purchasing more expensive homes will benefit from reduced costs.The move is intended to kickstart a property market that has slumped since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.Our stamp duty calculator below makes it easier for you to calculate the amount on a new property:Businesses will be given £2,000 for each person under the age of 25 who is employed as an apprentice.The aim is to help protect the “Covid generation” of young people entering the workforce who might otherwise struggle to find jobs.Mr Sunak hopes to triple the scale of apprenticeships on offer over the coming year in a bid to save thousands of new workers from disaster.The extra funding announced comes on top of a £1,000 payment the Government already provides for new young apprentices.Every Briton will be given a discount to eat out in August as part of a drive to boost economic activity stifled by the coronavirus crisis.Mr Sunak announced a creative new scheme to try to save the hospitality sector, which has been hammered by the lockdown and social distancing.The eat out to help out initiative will give diners up to £10 off per person when they eat out from Monday to Wednesday in August - and will apply to both adults and children.Mr Sunak said: Meals eaten at any participating business will be 50 per cent off, up to a maximum discount of £10 per head for everyone, including children. We can all eat out to help out.The Chancellor said restaurants participating in the scheme would be able to offer half-price meals every Monday to Wednesday throughout August.This means that everyone in Britain is entitled to discounts at restaurants over a total period of 13 days. Householders will be given grants of up to £10,000 to make their homes more environmentally friendly under a Government scheme that could save them £300 on average energy bills.The £3 billion energy-efficiency plan for homes and public buildings will support 140,000 jobs, save households money and cut carbon emissions, Mr Sunak said.In his summer economic statement, the Chancellor confirmed plans for a £2 billion green homes grant in September to provide vouchers for homeowners and landlords to cover at least two-thirds of the costs of insulation and other energy-efficiency measures.Employers will be given £1,000 for every worker they bring back from furlough as part of a £9.4 billion jobs retention bonus scheme.Under the new programme, businesses will receive a one-off payment for each employee that they have retained at the end of January.Iniduals must be paid at least £520 per month for their employers to qualify for the support in order to ensure they are in “decent work”.Mr Sunak hailed the “significance” of the policy, noting it could cost the Treasury in excess of £9 billion if all 9.4 million furloughed workers return to their jobs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/22/09/gettyimages-1013331630.jpg","title":"amy schumer pregnancy assistant disguise expecting amy","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Comedian was relentlessly pursued by paparazzi during her pregnancy, she says in her new docuseriesAmy Schumer has revealed she once asked her assistant to pretend to be her in order to distract paparazzi eager to take her photo while she was pregnant.In her new docuseries Expecting Amy, which covers the comedian’s often gruelling pregnancy, Schumer is seen disguising her assistant, who is also her sister-in-law, to throw photographers off her tail.“The day after her pregnancy we had a lot of paparazzi outside waiting,” Schumer’s husband Chris Fischer says at one point in the series.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMolly Fischer, Schumer’s assistant, was subsequently asked to dress in a hoodie and carry Schumer’s dog Tatiana in front of the paparazzi.Schumer added: “We were like, ‘Molly, you have to look s***tier and s***tier and s***tier’, until she was literally a homeless guy wearing a Hello Dolly sweatshirt.”Glee stars ask fans to pray as actor Naya Rivera goes missingJessica Hynes interview: ‘No one cares about me, I’m just an old fart’Schumer experienced a series of health woes throughout her pregnancy, including unrelenting nausea after being diagnosed with acute morning sickness.She and Fischer’s son, Gene, was born in 2019.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it was only found in the largest of those watches, and the solar charging was only ever intended to top up the charge rather than give endless power.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the new watches represent a further step as Garmin looks to harnass solar power to create watches that never or rarely need charging and so can keep tracking people theoretically forever, it said.The new watches include the smaller versions of the Fenix line-up, meaning that even the smallest Fenix 6S now has a solar version. Solar charging is now on the company\u0027s Tactix watches, which are built for military and other uses that require more secure tracking and a robust finish.Garmin launches new bike lights that can see if someone is behind youBut the most notable of the new watches is probably Garmin\u0027s new Instinct, its cheaper and more mainstream activity tracker, which can keep itself charged forever it is used in the right mode.The new watches come alongside a host of new updates, including features that add new surf-tracking features and tools to monitor indoor climbing performance.Garmin said that the new feature was added in part to reduce battery fatigue, or the idea that over time users will get bored of charging up their smartwatches. Instead, solar charging should allow the battery to keep powered up and need less charge by borrowing energy from the outdoor environment that its users are already in, Garmin said.The company had been looking to introduce solar-powered watches for a long time, according to Brad Trenkle, Garmin\u0027s vice president of outdoor. But the durability of the technology was unsatisfactory, it did not provide enough charge, and the design meant that introducing solar charging also meant compromising the aesthetic or functionality of the products, Mr Trenkle said.As such, it had waited until it could release watches that were able to meaningfully use the solar charge without becoming too thick or requiring other drawbacks, he said.Mr Trenkle described the introduction of the new solar-powered watches and the addition of features that ensured they could stay charged forever as a milestone – its second after the first were introduced last year – but that the company would love to be able to make that possible in more watches, in more modes. He did not give any specific indication of which of Garmin\u0027s products would receive solar charging, but indicated that it could come to large parts of the product line in the future.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They left me shocked, but also incredibly angry. And most of all determined to make the changes that are needed to protect women in the future.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPatients at risk from unsafe medicines and implants, inquiry revealsShe said the report “makes for harrowing reading, every page makes clear the pain and suffering that has been felt by so many patients and their families”.The patient safety minister said the healthcare system had to do better in the future: “The task now is to establish a quicker and more compassionate way to address issues of patient harm when they arise.“We must ensure that the system as a whole is vigilant in spotting safety concerns.“We must make sure that different voices are invited to the table and we must also make sure that patients and their families have a clear pathway to get better answers, and a resolution.”She also told MPs she believed there was an “unintentional bias” against women in healthcare when women raise safety concerns and she pointed to repeated health scandals affecting “women only issues.”She added: “I know that there will be strong feelings from across the House about this report, and that honourable members will be eager to hear a fuller response. However, it is imperative for the sake of those who have suffered so greatly that we give this review the full consideration, it absolutely deserves.”Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who established the Cumberlege inquiry in 2018 told MPs: I commissioned this report because I knew that many lives have been ruined because we didn\u0027t act quickly enough to deal with problems in these three areas, but I have to say the results are far more shocking and disturbing than I ever imagined.He warned the issue was far bigger than the three drugs and devices looked at by the inquiry and urged ministers to support the central recommendation of a patient safety commissioner.Mr Hunt also urged his successor as health secretary Matt Hancock to respond to the inquiry before the end of September.Liberal Democrat acting leader Ed Davy said: We want to see the conclusions implemented as soon as possible. We want to see the compensation for the women and their adult children, but I also want to see criminal charges brought against the real perpetrators of this scandal.

The broadcaster was due to introduce means-testing at the start of June.The policy changes mean more than 3 million households will need to pay the £157.50 fee from August, according to the BBC. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir David Clementi, the chairman of the broadcaster, said: “The decision to commence the new scheme in August has not been easy, but implementation of the new scheme will be Covid-19 safe. The BBC could not continue delaying the scheme without impacting on programmes and services.”Sir David added that around 1.5 million households could be exempt from paying the fee if someone is over 75 and receives pension credit. He also stressed that it was the government rather than the BBC that set and controlled who benefited from the measure.BBC to cut around 450 jobs across England BBC tells staff ‘not to wear Black Lives Matter badges on screen’“Like most organisations, the BBC is under severe financial pressure due to the pandemic, yet we have continued to put the public first in all our decisions,” he added. “I believe continuing to fund some free TV licences is the fairest decision for the public, as we will be supporting the poorest oldest pensioners without impacting the programmes and services that all audiences love.”The BBC agreed to take on responsibility for funding the scheme as part of the charter agreement hammered out with the government in 2015.Without the new means-testing system in place, the broadcaster said free TV licences would have cost it as much as £1bn a year because of the ageing population.The BBC has made large cuts recently and must now save an extra £125m because of the financial pressures caused by the pandemic. However, the charity Age UK has urged the government to “sit down” with the BBC to keep the licences free, as they have been since 2000. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “We’re bitterly disappointed by this decision on behalf of the millions of over-75s who have had a torrid time over the last few months and for whom this must feel like another kick in the teeth, during a terrible year.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, that has clearly not happened.”Labour said the government was to blame for the pulling of the “vital service”.Jo Stevens, the shadow culture secretary, said: “The refusal of the government to fund this vital service after promising to do so is nothing short of betrayal.“Many over-75s have spent months at home with TV providing an invaluable source of company during the pandemic. For the government to blame the BBC, who are having to contend with huge cuts, is simply passing the buck.”Additional reporting from Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The project manager from Colindale felt “guilty” about sitting at home while supported by taxpayer money through the furlough scheme. “I wanted to help others,” he said.

It’s great to help out.”Readers have just three more days to bid for a piece of Sir Peter’s Blake’s pop artwork, Our Fans, to raise money for Help The Hungry. The auction of the giant mural – which echoes Sir Peter’s design of The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album and was draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel during its 2017 renovation – closes at midnight on Friday.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It follows an earlier call for people to “eat out to help out”, referring to restaurant meals.Mr Dowden told reporters at the Downing Street press conference: “I’m really urging people to get out there and to play their part: buy the tickets for outdoor plays and musical recitals get to your local gallery and support your local businesses.Government to pilot mass coronavirus testing for high risk workers200,000 Americans expected to die from coronavirus before election day“Our fight began with a collective effort and I really hope it will end with one. At the beginning we all stayed at home to protect the NHS and save lives now the British public has a new part to play. It’s time to eat out to help out, to enjoy the arts to help out, and to work out to help out.“It’s over to all of you to help the country recover safely.”The announcement on outdoor performances gives the green light for venues such as Glyndebourne in East Sussex, and Cornwall’s Minack Theatre, to reopen this summer – as well as drive-in dates for the West End musical Six.A change in planning rules will also mean theatres, concert halls and live music venues will be protected from demolition or change of use by developers, preventing those that have been made temporarily vacant during lockdown disappearing altogether and giving extra security as they start to reopen.All tickets must be purchased online and venues are encouraged to move towards e-ticketing to help with track-and-trace operations in case of an outbreak at a performance.Mr Dowden said: “Our culture, heritage and arts are too precious to lose.

One survey by YouGov found that just 8 per cent of people said they will “definitely” use the meal discount scheme unveiled by the chancellor on Wednesday, with 24 per cent saying they probably will. This compares with 52 per cent saying they definitely will not or probably will not.Mr Dowden said at the press conference that face coverings will not be required in gyms but that other “mitigating measures”, such as regular cleaning, will be put in place. He said the government’s approach to face coverings was “context specific” and said it had been endorsed by scientific advisers as a ”proportionate approach whereby wearing masks is one way of mitigating risks, but it sits alongside a whole suite of other things”, including washing hands and social distancing.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in Bristol“Of course it is going to take a while for people’s confidence to build.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The government has been described as “out out touch” for its chosen examples of what people can enjoy after it said performing arts events can take place outdoors from this weekend. People have taken to social media to ridicule the culture secretary after he said “music lovers” could go to Glyndebourne, an opera house in East Sussex, this summer and people could watch plays at a theatre on the Cornish cliffs as venues open up again following disruption from coronavirus. “The masses are delighted to hear that Glyndebourne is back on,” one social media user joked. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“This government is so out of touch,” someone else tweeted. Announcing open-air performances can resume from this Saturday, Oliver Dowden singled out Glyndebourne — whose tickets for open-air opera in August have sold at £100 for adults and £50 for children — and plays at Cornwall’s open-air Minack Theatre.

Now HOW ABOUT COMEDY?” Another social media user shone a light on the fact they could go to open-air opera, but not watch their local football team. “Really in tune with man in the street,” they joked. Open-air performances have been given the go-ahead from this Saturday in England with a limited and socially-distanced audience. “Normal life is slowly returning. This is an important milestone for our performing artists who have been waiting patiently in the wing since March,” Mr Dowden said in a press briefing. “From 11 July, our theatres, operas, dance and music shows can start putting on outdoor performances to socially-distanced audiences.”He added: “That means theatre goers can experience a live play for the first time in and at places like the stunning Minack Theatre in Cornwall and musiclovers can attend Glyndebourne this summer.” The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, Fuji-Q Highland, which reopened last month, has told visitors to scream inside their hearts. The visitor attraction, which is located at the base of Mt Fuji, decided to give this unorthodox advice in order to reduce the risk of Covid-19 being transmitted through water droplets on its rides.   Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, executives at Fuji-Q Highland told the Wall Street Journal that anyone breaking the rules will not be punished. As part of its messaging campaign, the theme park started a challenge for people to pull their most serious face, with prizes being awarded for the best photos on its rides. The site also released an online video in which two of its executives demonstrate its new policy.The two men - one in a full suit and tie, the other in a shirt and bow tie - can been seen riding the rollercoaster in silence for four minutes. They also wear masks, as all visitors are also required to do. The clip finishes with the words: Please scream inside your heart.Although Japan has had a relatively low infection rate, the number of new cases in Tokyo has jumped in recent days. On Thursday, the capital recorded 224 new Covid-19 cases, the highest figure it has seen in a single day.

Within the Commonwealth those countries continue to share a bond.The Commonwealth emerged in the decolonisation process, through nations that were united in being former colonial states still being able to connect with one another, to share information, to share history, in ious dferent ways.It maintains those connections, but not from a colonial perspective of British rule.This organisation is a symbol of a fresh start for the relationship between nations that were once part of the British Empire.That’s an example of how we can move on from the past – we move on through our actions, by transcending history, by being more than that, by looking towards the future.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The publisher of the Mail on Sunday is the one on trial. It is this publisher that acted unlawfully and is attempting to evade accountability to create a circus and distract from the point of this case - that the Mail on Sunday unlawfully published my private letter.Each of these women is a private citizen, young mother, and each has a basic right to privacy.Both the Mail on Sunday and the court system have their names on a confidential schedule, but for the Mail on Sunday to expose them in the public domain for no reason other than clickbait and commercial gain is vicious and poses a threat to their emotional and mental wellbeing.A Mail on Sunday spokesperson today said they had absolutely no intention of publishing the identities of Meghans five friends.They said: But their evidence is at the heart of the case and we see no reason why their identities should be kept secret.That is why we told the Duchesss lawyers last week that the question of their confidentiality should be properly considered by the court.Last week, the duchess claimed in court documents that her friends had been rightly concerned for her welfare when pregnant.The Duchess named the pals - although they are only referred to as A, B, C, D and E in the papers - and they could now be called to testy at a trial.People magazine previously described them as Meghans inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante.Meghan has identied one of her five pals, Friend A, as the person who told People magazine the letter said: “Dad, I’m so heartbroken.

Treatments such as manicures, massages, pedicures and body waxes will be able to restart. But ones that involve touching another persons face - such as facials and eyebrow threading will stay banned because of the risk of spreading germs. Staff have to wear visors or use screens when treating clients and walk-in treatments are banned - you have to book instead.Businesses will need to keep records of staff and customers and share these with NHS Test and Trace where requested,and they will have to do a covid risk assessment before they reopen.The guidance also applies to businesses that operate in dferent locations, such as massage therapists working in people’s homes, and those learning in vocational training environments.   It comes after The Sun has campaigned on the issue - highlighting the drastic effects on many thousands of women working in the industry.Salons slammed the Government for appearing to laugh when he was asked they will be allowed to reopen.When William Wragg, Tory MP for Hazel Grove in Greater Manchester, asked in the Commons last week when the sector could reopen, he joked that neither he nor the PM were likely to visit a beauty salon any time soon.What  was announced this evening:The reopening comes after MPs called on the Government for action telling them the beauty industry was being decimated by continued closures. Labour MPs Carolyn Harris and Judith Cummins, Chair of the Beauty Aesthetics and Wellbeing APPG, said the Governmen was not taking the issue serious because it was dominated by women. In a letter to the PM they said: It is dficult to see that this is a laughing matter. Were people laughing because this is an industry in which women predominate And is it because of the Government’s perception that this is just an industry of ‘nail bars’ that you have failed to give any indication as to when the industry can reopen ”They outlined how the industry contributes a total of £. billion to the UK’s economy and employs a total of , people across the entire industry.The beauty industry in this country is being decimated, they said in the letter. Business Secretary, Alok Sharma said tonight: “We have been clear throughout this crisis that we want as many businesses as possible to reopen, but we must be confident it is safe for them to do so.“From Monday  July thousands more businesses which offer close contact services like nail and beauty salons will be able to welcome customers back in a way that is safe for both workers and the public.“Enabling these often small, independent businesses to reopen is yet another step in our plan to kickstart the economy to support jobs and incomes across the country.”Millie Kendall MBE, British Beauty Council, said: “The decision to broaden the scope of available hair and beauty services will allow many more beauty professionals to get back to work, and will also allow customers to benefit from a range of beauty treatments which can be carried out safely for both client and practitioner.“It’s a positive step, but we are still only part of the way there.The Feel Good Group - which has over  tanning salons and employs more than  people across the country welcomed the move but said it was unfair they werent able to reopen at the same time as hairdressers. Founder and chief exec Adam Mooney said: “While we welcome the decision to finally allow us to reopen, the government could have allowed us to open last week, when hairdressers re-opened. We are ready to reopen today, not next week.”He added that many of the workers are among some of the hardest hit from the lockdown. More than  percent of our staff are women, and most in the - year-old age group, which is the demographic which has been worst hit, financially, by the pandemic, and they are very keen to get back to work, he said.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The respected IFS think tank warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak will be forced to hike taxes as the nationaposs £bn Covid- splurge leads to a reckoning. And borrowing will hit its highest levels in  years apart from the two world wars, the experts said. in the wake of yesterdayaposs mini-Budget. It comes after Mr Sunak refused to rule out long-term tax rises and admitted there will be dficult decisions in future amid a very signicant recession. IFS Director Paul Johnson predicted no big tax rises this year or next, but said: A reckoning, in the form of higher taxes, will come eventually. He added: This is no normal recession - it’s the deepest in our history.” Last month the national debt exceeded the UKaposs entire annual GDP for the first time since  as the Chancellor pumped cash into propping up the economy. £bn has been spent on the NHSaposs test and trace programme alone - and another £bn on protective equipment for frontline staff. IFS Deputy Director Carl Emmerson warned debt will be much, much higher than anticipated - and £bn of borrowing this year and next wouldnapost be a surprise.  He said: “We are going to borrow more as a share of GDP than we did at the peak of the financial crisis. “And in fact the UK will borrow more as a share of GDP than it ever has done in the last  years, outside of the two world wars.”  Mr Emmerson said while government borrowing is currently cheap, that could change. He said: Managing that elevated debt, and in particular the risk that the relationship between interest rates and economic growth turns out to be less favourable than it is at the moment, will be a task for not just the current Chancellor but also many of his successors. “It’s going to take decades before we manage that debt back down to the levels we were used to pre this crisis.”  Mr Emmerson said tax rises of around £bn a year - .% of GDP - might be needed just to stabilise the debt adding: It could be quite a chunky tax rise.” But he added there was uncertainty around the figure - because the economy may end up permanently smaller.Mr Emmerson said: The Chancellor also said in his speech yesterday that over the medium term we must and we will put our public finances back on a sustainable footing. Now what I think that means is that once weaposre through the crisis phase, once the economy has established its new normal, we are probably going to find that the economy is not as big as what it would have been had the coronavirus never hit. If thataposs the case, and itaposs very likely to be the case, revenues will still be depressed. Andwe want to try then to bring the deficit back to where it would have been absent the crisis we will need to do some spending cuts, or given a decade of austerity, perhaps more likely some tax rises. Delivering its verdict on the Summer Economic Update, the IFS predicted tax rises were inevitable. Director Paul Johnson said: “The second and subsequent acts are much trickier to deliver and get right. They need to get the balance between preserving those parts of the economy which have a long-term future and helping the transition to a new normal. They also need to actually deliver goods and services and change.

Outdoor pools and grassroots sports are set to lead the way from this Saturday - with beauty salons set to follow on Monday  July. Theatres, opera, live music and dance troupes will also be able to put on outdoor shows from this weekend. And from July  indoor gyms, dance studios and skating rinks will be able to reopen too. But there is still no date for nightclubs to reopen - nor is there a date for indoor theatres to open their doors for good. And there has been no government announcement on indoor play areas, piercing studios, bowling alleys or casinos. Here are all the changes announced tonight and those areas still waiting for a date. Outdoor swimming pools and water parks will be allowed to re-open from Saturday in England. So can outdoor hot tubs, hydrotherapy pools, whirlpools and jacuzzis. Timed bookings will reduce the number of people using a pool at one time - and people will be encouraged to shower and change at home. Operators will be told to ensure an appropriate number of people are in a swimming pool at any one time - to allow three square metres per bather. Saturday  July: Grassroots sports  The government has given the green light for grassroots sport to- starting with cricket from July . But it must be organised team sport, and each inidual sport must submit an action plan and related guidance to the government before it can restart. These include collecting information on participants at both training and matches to support Test and Trace. All players, officials, volunteers and spectators must undergo a self-assessment for any Covid- symptoms. Clubs should strictly limit the time spent congregating at a venue before a match begins. Players should arrive changed and ready to warm up, limiting time spent waiting around or in changing rooms. And basketballs, cricket balls and footballs may need to be cleaned regularly, such as every time they go out of play.  Theatres, operas and dance troupes in England can restart outdoor shows from this Saturday. It will allow the Glyndebourne opera festival to go ahead this year - along with the Minack Theatre in Cornwall. But disaster looms for Londonaposs West End after the government failed to give a date for when indoor shows can resume. Instead the industry will pilot a number of small indoor performances with a social distanced audience to help devise a reopening plan. Theatre venues will be forced to operate at a reduced capacity with only limited tickets - all of which must be bought online. Venues should have social distancing marking, deep cleaning of auditoriums, and long enough gaps between shows to deep clean. Only professionals may sing or play brass or wind instruments in front of an audience.Monday  July: Nail bars, tattoo studios and tanning salons Beauticians, nail bars, tattooists, spas, massage parlours, physical therapy businesses and tanning salons can reopen from Monday  July in England. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden announced other close contact services can now also reopen from that date. But facial treatments, including eyelashes, will not be allowed for the moment. Clients and beauticians will be separated by screens, gloves worn where possible and no food or drink other than water will be allowed.

Gym lovers have been forced to get their endorphins going at home since the facilities were forced to close when England went into lockdown on March . But today Culture Secretary Oliver Downden announced that after working with Public Health England and the sector, gyms would be allowed to reopen.  Gym owners warned that huge numbers of facilities would have gone bustthey werenapost allowed to reopen, after being left out of earlier bids to ease the lockdown. But now with a date to reopen in site they will need to make a lot of changes. So what might look dferent when you get back to the gym  You might have to book a time slot to get in If all of these measures have one thing in common it is trying to reduce the number of people you come into contact with in order to try and reduce the risk as much as possible. So it isnapost surprising that gyms will be told to limit the number of people they can have inside at any given time. Part of the suggestion from the Government is that inidual facilities use a booking system to make sure that gyms are not overcrowded. It would also provide a handy list to for contact tracerssome did later test positive for the virus.  A lot less people Gyms will be asked to reduce the number of people inside dramatically. With them only having one person per  metre squared in the facility.But gyms will be allowed to include changing room space, and other indoor facilities like tennis courts, when calculating the total of people that will be allowed in.But it does mean that the morning rush at big gyms will look very dferent. Smaller class sizes Along a similar line, exercise class sizes are to be slashed in order to reduce the number of people coming into contact with one another and to make it easier for people to socially distance. Another change will be increasing the amount of time between exercise classes, to avoid people queuing outside classrooms and allow time to clean facilities like shared bikes and other equipment.  One way systems Throughout the gym expect to see one way systems to reduce the chance of exercisers bumping into one another. It might mean changes to peopleaposs exercise routine - but it might also be an incentive not to skip leg day. Less equipment, spaced out In order to reduce the number of surfaces, that could become contaminated, and make it easier to keep you distance from other gym users you can expect to see fewer pieces of equipment and for it to be more spaced out. Equipment will also need to be regularly cleaned and wiped down. No loud music - and you might be told to keep the noise down Venues have been told to take steps avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes - but is not limited to - refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission - particularly from aerosol and droplet transmission. So your spin class leader might be a bit less chatty.  Limits on the number of people in the pool at one You can also expect a hard limit on the number of people allowed in a swimming pool at any one time.  You may also see reduced opening hours to give increased time for cleaning. Swimming pools should restrict numbers to allow sqm per bather. Oh andyou want to use a flume you need to do it in a socially distanced manner. No saunas Saunas and steam rooms should stay out of use for the time being as scientists have warned that the risk of transmission is unclear. Lots and lots of cleaningOne of the reasons gyms have taken so long to reopen is that closed environments filled with people sweating and breathing heavily are basically a dream for the coronavirus.As a result, expect the cleaning routine demanded by your gym when it reopens to be demanding. You might be asked to go home sweaty While showers and changing rooms are going to be allowed to reopen, the guidance is going to ask people to wherever possible shower and get changed at home to reduce the risk of transmission in changing rooms.

As Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden unveiled the reopening of gyms, nail bars, tattooists and more, he said it was now time to work out to help out.Itaposs time to eat out to help out, to enjoy the arts to help out and to work out to help out. he added.This followed Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs launch of the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme yesterday - which was slammed as a aposdining-out discount for the well-offapos.And earlier in the fight against the deadly bug, Boris Johnsonaposs aposStay Alert, Control the Virusapos slogan was mocked as vague and ambiguous.

Work out to help out!apos My sons and I looked at each other and winced.  Anthony Goodwin appeared flabbergasted, and made the point that not every one will be able to afford to boost the economy by joining in with this smorgasbord of dining out and working out.

While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and other royals before them allowed the press to take photos of them arriving at the church, Meghan and Harry kept the entire day behind closed doors. Instead, they released a couple of lovely photos to mark to occasion - including a gorgeous family shot. It showed the proud parents holding their baby boy surrounding by those who love him, including Kate, William, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghanaposs mum Doria and Princess Dianaaposs sisters. However the Queen and Prince Philip were missing from the line up, which raised questions among wellwishers. Buckingham Palace announced that the couple unfortunately couldnapost attend as they had a prior engagement. They also missed Prince Louisaposs christening earlier in the year, but attended George and Charlotteaposs celebrations. However new book Royals at War claims that there was more to the non-attendance than first thought.  Journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett write: Pointedly, the Queen and Prince Philio stayed away,reports the Daily Star. They had been generous and understanding at their best. But they simply now felt publicly embarrassed by Meghanaposs controlling behaviour, said a well-placed Palace insider. At the time, there were claims that Meghan and Harry had originally planned to hold the christening on a dferent date before realising neither the Queen or Charles would be able to attend. But by pushing it back a day, Charles couldfrom his week in Wales marking  years as the Prince of Wales and head to his fourth grandchildaposs christening in Windsor. However the Queen still couldnapost attend as she had already made arrangements to spend the weekend in Sandringham with Prince Philip, having spent the previous week at Holyrood in Scotland. The situation is said to have surprised some staff at Buckingham Palace. Speaking of Meghan and Harry, one employee reportedly said: There is a feeling amongst some that they should have been more accommodating about the date.

Fiona Gibson, , and brothers Alexander James, eight, and Philip, five, were taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after the blaze at the property in Renfrew Road, Paisley, on June . They died a short time after being admitted. A family friend said last week that the childrenaposs mother Julie had been discharged from hospital and had begun the very heartbreaking process of laying her three babies to rest. People were asked to wear colourful clothing and to clap softly as the funeral procession passed through the Gallowhill area of the Renfrewshire town on Thursday. The first of the three hearses carried a pink coffin while the other two carried blue ones, and the third hearse also had a decoration in the shape of a rainbow. The cortege passed close to St Catherineaposs Primary School where the two younger boys were pupils. Head teacher Emma Henry previously said: We are truly saddened by the loss of Alexander and Philip. They were both full of energy and such an important part of our school. Both boys loved the outdoors and frequently talked about their regular visits to the park. They never ceased to make us smile. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this time.After leaving the Gallowhill area, the cortege made its way to Hawkhead Cemetery. Fiona was a pupil at Mary Russell School in Paisley, where head teacher Julie McCallum, said: Words cannot express the sadness we are feeling. Fiona was a wee shining light in our Mary Russell family and to lose three young lives in this way is devastating for everyone. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and all affected by this tragedy at this very sad time.A JustGiving page set up by a family friend and posted on the Facebook page of the childrenaposs father Alex Gibson has raised more than £,, well beyond the £, target.

This is the ONSaposs lowest estimate yet of the spread of the virus but indicates that the current rate of shrinkage is slow.At the initial peak, research by the ONS and Oxford University found one in every  - . per cent of adults - carried the bug between April  and May .There were , people estimated to be infected at the beginning of May.But the latest data from the Covid- surveillance study for England suggests an estimated average of , people had coronavirus between June  and July .Around , people caught the bug each day, just .% of the population - down from .% two weeks ago - or one in every ,. However, the ONS said the decline in cases appears to have levelled off in recent weeks. They urged caution over reading too much into the figures due to the low number of positive cases. During the -day period from June  to July , there were an estimated two new Covid- infections for every , people per week, equating to an estimated , new cases per day. The estimates are based on swab tests collected from , people, of which a tiny number of iniduals - eight from eight dferent households - tested positive. The ONS found infection rates within households followed a similar trend as for iniduals. They calculated that four households per , households were newly infected in the period from June  to July , . Meanwhile a separate study, from Kingaposs College London suggests cases have stopped shrinking in the past week. Their data shows there are currently , daily new cases of Covid- - up slightly on last week when there were , new infections.  Epidemiologist Professor Tim Spector from Kingaposs College London is behind the study. He said: “It is disappointing to see that the number of daily new cases are no longer falling like they have been in previous weeks, this could be a temporary blip or due to the easing of lockdown and the amount of social contact slowly increasing. Importantly our updated analysis of the prevalence is still continuing to show that the Midlands and Wales are key areas in the country where the amount of Covid is remaining relatively high. It is important that we keep a close eye on these areas.  With the growing number of people suffering for extended periods of time, we are going to be focusing on these long term sufferers to help us research causes and potential treatments. But in order for this to be possible, we need all our users to continue to log in, eventhey have been ill and have got better.” Across the past week, the average number of new cases of coronavirus in the UK has been , with  today. And the ONS said the decline in coronavirus cases, which was so apparent in May and June, has levelled off. Todayaposs report said: When analysing data for the most recent non-overlapping -day periods, these estimates suggest the percentage testing positive has decreased over time since April , and this downward trend appears to have now levelled off. Over the last three -day periods, the iation in the percentage testing positive is consistent with random iation based on sampling. The UKaposs true death toll is more than , higher than reported by the government, according to the latest available data.

She said there would unlikely be three consecutive days of hot enough weather to trigger a heatwave warning.  Weaposre certainly looking at a drier start to next week.

In the meantime, this weekaposs dull skies are expected to brighten closer to the weekend, with temperatures warming particularly in the south and west. Friday may bring sunny spells and showers with a risk of thunderstorms in the east.

Poorly fitting masks can decrease the effectiveness in stopping airborne particles from potentially infecting others, and a dentist has now revealed an incredibly simple hack to help improve the fit.  In a video uploaded to TikTok, dentist Dr Olivia shared a short instructional video titled: How to make a regular mask more protective.She puts the mask on and points out the gaps at the side of her face and underneath, saying it leaves the areas very exposed to the outside. After washing your hands, she recommends folding your mask in half ways, before taking the elastic which goes around your ear on one side and tying a knot as close to the corners of the mask as possible.  Repeat it on the other side and open the mask back up, tucking in the small gaps created by the knot in the elastic on either end. Dr Olivia then reapplies the mask to her face, showing it to have a far more effective circular fit than previously. You can see the full video of how itaposs done above. She says: This is a great trick for anyone with smaller faces because you will have a better fitted mask.

You’d be stupid not to.“If you#re not going to buy into it, he#s not going to let you up at the club.“You#ve got to want to win – the gaffer wants to win every week. That#s what we learned. And that#s what we started to do.“I don#t know, whether it#s in his plans to take Dundee United into Europe or somehow he ends up at Rangers or Celtic or somewhere .“He’s worked so hard and wants to be the best in his field, at whatever level he’s at.“He wanted to be the best manager in League Two, the best manager in League One. Now he will want to be the best manager in the Scottish Premiership.“If I’m honest, I think he can go wherever he wants to go.”Norwood – who has scored  goals in  appearances for Ipswich in League One this season – says Mellon created an incredible team spirit at Prenton Park.The ex-Forest Green Rovers forward says expert man-management was the key to the squad’s bond.“Behind the scenes he has been great for me,” he added. “From a personal standpoint, he obviously helped me get to where I am now.“He worked hard with me and was patient – his man-management skills were second to none.“Some people aren’t easy to manage but he finds a way to get the best out of them. I#ve got a lot of fond memories from the three years I spent with him.”Mellon # who has signed a two-year deal with United # is regarded as a promotion and play-off specialist in the lower leagues down south and that success led to interest in his players.Norwood said: “In the summer after the first promotion I had a bid come in and I rang the gaffer.“He said to me, ‘Nors, see this season, play the season, you#re going to score a lot of goals, you#ve got to trust me, and then whatever happens after that happens after that.’“I believed every word that he said. Then  goals later, I got a great move.“So that was me putting my career and my faith in the gaffer’s hands, he did want me to succeed.“He set up a team for me to score goals and we were successful doing that. So I owe where I am now to the gaffer.”He added: “I think the way he ran the team, the way he let the players run the changing room…he was the enforcerhe needed to be, but he very much let the players manage everything.“We became so close knit during those three or four years. He let us do our thing. We would perform on a Saturday and get our rewards.“The success were down to everyone but they stemmed from when the gaffer came in.”Getting the basics right was crucial to Mellon – who gave Leicester City legend Jamie Vardy his break in the professional ranks at Fleetwood Town – in his early days at Tranmere Rovers.Norwood reckons his former boss will be a huge hit in his homeland.The striker said: “He#ll find a way he wants to play at Dundee United and he will be successful with it.“Ultimately,you#re successful, then the fans buy in to it and they love watching the team win.“Hard work, first and foremost, is a given with the gaffer. You don#t need the ability to work hard, and that#s what he#ll say.”Opportunity to manage Dundee United #really special# for new Tannadice boss Micky Mellon\" title\"#Opportunity to manage Dundee United #really special# for new Tannadice boss Micky Mellon# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-tranmere embed # secretODZdeGcQu\" data-secret\"ODZdeGcQu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

to a still-to-be-confirmed new date, was the idea of team-mates Kai Austin and Nathan Stokes.Twenty-one-year-old Kai, who plays right back for the side, said: ldquoA lot of clubs have been making signings and we knew Preston were struggling even to just keep going.ldquoI have seen where someone has cycled or driven to the  league grounds [in the Scottish Premiership to League Two].ldquoWe thought maybe it would be a cool idea to do something like that at our level.ldquoWe came up with a challenge to entice people to want to donate and will us on.ldquoWe came up with visiting  grounds for  teams for the   season.The teammates plan to start at New Countess Park, home of Dunbar United.From there, it is on to Millfield , Foresters Parkand New Recreation Park .The cyclists will then head into Midlothian and tick off Kingrsquos Park , Newbattle Complex , New Victoria Park , Newbyres Park , New Dundas Park , Ferguson Parkand Penicuik Park .Then it is into the Capital for stops at Paties Road , Meggetland , Saughton Enclosure , Christie Gillies Park , Ainslie Park Stadium , St Marks Parkand finally Peffermill .Finally, the weary cyclists willto East Lothian and tick off Olivebankbefore reaching the finish line and familiar surroundings of The Pennypit .In total, the cycle, which is about  kilometres , is expected to take upwards of seven hours, with the players stopping for a photograph at each ground.The fundraiser is also the latest step on the road to recovery for midfielder Nathan.The -year-old missed the entire   season after a horror ankle injury in pre-season, which saw ligaments ripped off the bone.Now, he is keen to get back to fitness ahead of the new campaign kicking off.He said: ldquoI have still been going to watch matches and getting the changing room banter.ldquoWe are all in a group chat and a lot of the boys have been working on their fitness throughout lockdown.ldquoThey have been out running or cycling and a lot of the boys are keen to get back to it and we are all missing it, especially myself.ldquoI am hoping to be back for next season.ldquoIt has been a long hard battle to get back fit after surgery.ldquoIt has been three months since surgery and the doctor and physio said it would be three to six months before I am back playing.Nathan, who previously played for Musselburgh Windsor and Ormiston, has played at most of the grounds but will tick off visiting Haddington, Newtongrange Star, Arniston Rangers and Civil Service Strollers during the cycle.He was looking forward to the fundraiser and was pleased with the reaction from members of the public, with more than pound already donated.He said: ldquoMy mum is a carer, Irsquove got family and friends who work in the NHS, so it is a no brainer to be

Not even the number  night bus that trundles through Port Seton on an hourly basis.Was it the silence that was keeping me awake  Or was it the fact that, by this time, my mind was racing ahead to the things that I had to do the next day In these recent months, one of the most common things to hear people say is that their sleeping pattern isnrsquot what it once was.I even Googled it and came across an article from a popular news website in which those interviewed recounted how the events of recent months had affected their ability to sleep.It seems that much of this has been caused by the changes to our daily routine.As we have been spending more time at home than usual, wersquore not expending the same energy as we do when times are more lsquonormalrsquo.Even sunny days, when we would normally go out and soak up the sun, are often spent inside the coolness of our homes.And,we are honest, we probably need to add into the mix a certain measure of anxiety.It is not easy to hear even the improving facts and figures that are circulated each day, nor to be reminded that, whilst things might be looking up, such a situation relies on our continued responsible behaviour.As I lay awake, which included thinking about what I would put into this column that you are now reading, I was reminded of the Psalmist in the Old Testament who confesses that sometimes he too lies awake at night, his mind buzzing around from here to there.So, what does he do when he cannot sleep Psalm  and verse : ldquoOn my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.He turns his attention to God. Something worth considering as we too doze on and off in the wee small hours."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-st-andrews-old-kirk","story":"The fallen-down walls and tall standing central gable give it a very picturesque quality, perfectly situated just beyond the edge of the golf course.I may be wrong, but I suspect it is not really a place many people purposely go to visit. As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time. They married the Costa sisters, Zelinda and Carmen.Le was hard as Alfrsquos parents worked in the s through to the late s, with Zelinda looking after the children, maintaining a home and helping in the shop. They would have worked seven days a week, from dawn till dusk.Like most Italian immigrants of the time, they built the business from nothing to create a small ice cream factory behind the cafe.The ice cream was made by hand and boiled in small quantities each day in response to the demand. They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf.

introduced the coastal car parking policy, they deliberately restricted the spaces here to limit disturbance of the important sensitive habitats and wildle.They could have decided to create a larger car parking area to maximise income but, to their credit, they did not do this.In contrast, they allowed much more parking on the opposite side of the estuary, at John Muir Country Park, which is closer to Dunbar and the East Links Family Park.Such zoning is a useful tool both to provide space for people to freely enjoy the outdoors while also protectinghabitats for wildle and for those who prefer a more peaceful environment.Although I support the actions of the council for the reasons given, I do think they should have gone further and imposed some additional restrictions within the John Muir Country Park on the east side of the estuary.In particular, dogs off the lead persistently disturb feeding and nesting birds and I believe that dogs should only be allowed in the area of the

The two households can be of any size, but all members must be part of the same extended household.This means that two householdswill be able to stay overnight together - either at each others homes or away from home in self-contained accommodation."},{"url":null,"title":"everyone-scotland-can-get-free-pint-tennents-next-week","story":"Hundreds of thousands of complimentary pints of Tennentrsquos Lager and Tennentrsquos Light will be waiting at  premises across the country.It comes as beer gardens welcome visitors after  weeks of lockdown and bars could reopen with social distancing on July .Kenny Gray, managing director at Tennentrsquos, said: ldquoFor the last  years, Tennentrsquos Lager has been dedicated to Scotland and proud to serve the freshest, quality pints to pubs and drinkers across the country.ldquoFrom moments with friends and family to birthdays, holidays, anniversaries and graduations, the list of things wersquove all missed during this dficult period is endless and we know that going to the pub ranks highly.ldquoAfter work drinks, cosy pub lunches and memorable nights out with friends have all been put on hold for nearly four long months.ldquoBut we can now finally look forward to celebrating these important milestones once again while creating new ones ndash and what better way to welcome everyone back than by dedicating a pint of Tennentrsquos Lager or Tennentrsquos Light to Scotland How can I claim my pint Drinkers can claim online atTennentsdedicatedtoyou.#"},{"url":null,"title":"take-rubbish-home-scots-beauty-spots-swamped-litter-lockdown-eases","story":"Government agencies, campaigners and environmental experts have come together to issue a joint plea for people to act responsibly as restrictions ease further throughout Scotland.In the last few weeks, Scots have been allowed to venture further from there homes as part of the Scottish Governments route map out of lockdown.But some tourist hot spots have seen their landscapes and environments marred by a barrage of litter and human waste.Forestry and Land Scotland has reminded members of the public that while many car parks and beauty spots are now open, waste collection services may not be operational.Chief executiveSimon Hodgson said:ldquoAs Scotland gets re-accustomed to travelling further afield for leisure pursuits, we are appealing to the public to help avoid repeats of the selfish, irresponsible behaviour that over the past few weeks has seen many sites swamped by litter ndash or even despoiled by human waste.ldquoThis sort of anti-social behaviour not only creates a signicant health hazard but also eats in to the limited resources that land managers have at their disposal.ldquoWe would urge people to first of all think carefully about their travel plans, and secondly to behave like people who are proud to be able to call such a beautul country home: donrsquot visit sites until they are open and take your litter home.Mr Hodgson added:ldquoThe sad thing is, many of the people responsible for the littering would say they were proud to live in Scotland, and yet as we have seen over the past few weeks, they treat our beautul countryside in this contemptible manner.

The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this.

How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers.

Covid- has starkly revealed that some of our everyday lives have clear measurable impacts. A desire to Build Back Better, to restore our economy but also protect our planet and create green jobs has grown. With a recent BBC poll finding that  per cent of people think climate change is as serious as Covid-, itrsquos vital we listen to what they want.Key workers in recycling and waste management have performed an essential service during the pandemic and now, the sector so vital to driving a better environment, must answer the demand to drive a greener recovery.Even during such a devastating crisis, or perhaps because of it, we must think again about the waste we produce. We must drive resource re-use, end waste exports and ert from landfill to achieve a zero-waste economy.For Viridor, the key to unlocking this change is to see waste as a resource, and not as rubbish turning packaging and products back into new products which are reused here in Scotland. This could create new skilled jobs while driving down waste and carbon emissions. Making sure waste is truly valuable is key to ensuring what we discard does not escape the recycling net, going on to harm our environment.Last week we launched our vision of how we might make build back better a reality in Scotland. A Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park. A site dedicated to moving towards a zero-waste economy where our waste is reprocessed into new materials to be reused in Scotland. A site that brings major new investment and green jobs with a better environment. A site that meets the hopes and expectations of the Scottish people.But this vision is far bigger than one company. This is why we brought together  people in this sector, including Scotlandrsquos Minister for Trade, Ivan McKee Sepa CEO Terry ArsquoHearn, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, Heriot-Watt University and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. Innovating to make a zero-waste economy, securing Scottish investment, creating green jobs can only be doneeveryone works together.Mr McKee noted the ldquotime had come for Scotland to be clear about the infrastructure investment required to deliver the world-leading circular economy it is committed to. This is crucial. Recycling and reprocessing of plastics, glass, paper and card does not happen without a signicant investment. This sentiment and ambition were matched by the Princess Royal who, in a video message recorded specically for the event, noted that investing in the circular economy is key to ldquogiving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Time and again, people focused the opportunity we have to ensure Scotland emerges from this crisis with a brighter future. Too many Scottish resources are being lost to export along with the investment and jobs that goes with it. If we stand back and respond to what people want, this crisis could spur a truly sustainable economy and ensure the recycling sector remains more relevant than ever.Investment in the crucial recycling infrastructure needed to create a zero-waste economy and retain our resources in Scotland cannot be achieved overnight nor by any one organisation. Now is the time to start working together, to define the skills and innovation required and to invest in the future to ensure we emerge from this crisis better and stronger.Tim Rotheray is Viridor Director of Innovation and Regulation"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  There is method to the madness of spend  spend  spend","story":"Advocates include Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the economist Stephanie Kelton and the Labour-supporting tax specialist Richard Murphy. It may be that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has also become a devotee of this theory, which says governments can spend public money without having to worry about debt.He is in the hole for pound billion because of Covid and has seen the UK debt pile rise to nearly pound trillion. He borrowed a record poundbn in April alone. But he doesnrsquot sound all that worried and will be adding to it today in his summer statement.Modern monetarists believe that the traditional view of government finance ndash that it has to raise tax revenue to pay for services like the NHS ndash is wrong. Governments can spend on anything they want by printing money or borrowing. Just think of a number, print it and yoursquore off to the races. Rodger Malcolm Mitchellrsquos MMT book Free Money sums it up.So whatBritainrsquos debt has rocketed to more than  per cent of GDP  Doesnrsquot matter. Japan has public debt of % of GDP and seems to be surviving. An independent Scotland shouldnrsquot bother about debt either, so long as it has control of its currency, because it can just print Scottish pounds to pay for it.It sounds crazy, like Zimbabwean economics. And ultimately Modern Monetary Theory is a reductio ad absurdam. Fiat money has no intrinsic value soyou just increase the volume of it, without generating equivalent wealth, then its value will tend to reduce to nothing ndash as in Weimar Germany where people needed wheelbarr,ows to collect wages.However, there is method to MMT madness. It contains an important kernel of truth: that government spending, given low inflation, does not need to be financed by tax revenue.The traditional Thatcherite view, that you can only spend what you can afford, is back to front. If the state spends to get the economy moving in a recession the debt effectively finances itself by generating future taxation from the people newly employed.This was what John Maynard Keynes ndash really the grandfather of MMT ndash argued during the Great Depression. If governments spend money on, say, arms production the people employed in these factories go on to pay for goods and services from where in the private sector ndash food, clothing, housing and so on. This creates more private sector jobs through the so-called ldquomultiplier effect.Thus, a pound spent by the government generates more pounds in future by stimulating economic activity. So long as there is less than full employment governments should spend whatever it takes to get the economy running at full capacity. They could even pay people to dig holes and fill them in again.Yes, itrsquos a kind of free lunch argument and has been much criticised by conventional economists ndash including the European Central Bank - who believe excessive government spending debases the currency, distorts the market and leads to financial collapse, Greek style. Environmentalists donrsquot like the emphasis on growth.What has made Keynsianism, or MMT, so plausible recently is that many central banks have been printing money like therersquos no tomorrow since  and so far prices have remained stable and the roof has not fallen in. In the UK, the Bank of England has created an astonishing poundbn through Quantitative Easing ndash buying government debt.Conservatives like Boris Johnson, hardly radical leftists, are increasingly seeing debt as a good thing ndash or at any rate nothing to worry about. In order to keep his ldquored wall gains intact, Mr Johnson has promised to ldquobuild, build, build.Right now, interest rates are near zero, so there seems little reason to forgo spending. And thatrsquos precisely what Mr Sunak has been doing. In sheer volume terms he has spent more rapidly than any government in British history, mostly paying for furloughed employees.Paying private sector wages goes beyond what Modern Monetary Theorists advocate. It is more in the style of old-fashioned Marxists who wanted the state to take over the economy entirely. MMTers donrsquot want to nationalise the means of production.Of course, common sense says public spending canrsquot increase indefinitely. What about the interest on government debt  Surely that has to be paid. The UK currently spends poundbn a year on debt interest ndash more than on defence.Modern monetarists like Richard Murphy say the government should simply print more money to pay this, which it can do up to a point. However most government debt is owned by private pension funds and institutional investors or by foreign banks and financiers. In the long term,the government paid its debts in worthless printed pounds, theyrsquod soon stop lending.ldquoBut in the long run, said Keynes, ldquowersquore all dead. The Bank of England has printed hundreds of billions in QE since  and financiers are still falling over themselves to lend. Indeed, theyrsquore effectively lending at zero interest and getting nothing for their money.Mr Sunak will promise that Britainrsquos debts will be paid ndash he has to say that because free money sounds irresponsible. But he is likely to keep borrowing and spending because it is politically the sensible thing to do avert a Covid depression.People on the left are puzzled by this. Why is a Tory politician adopting the economics of Bernie Sanders  Well, it might be worth mentioning that one of the main founders of MMT was a hedge fund manager and tax exile, Warren Mosler, in the s. MMT is not a particularly left wing idea, nor is public debt.The former Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, said in  that ldquodeficits donrsquot matter. Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George Bush massively increased US public debt. It has been Democrats like Barak Obama and Bill Clinton who have sweated to reduce deficits.Donald Trump has ramped up more debt than any US government in history,  trillion, and is about to borrow trillion more.

In this time of heightened awareness of race and inequality we should remember that the climate impact of our high carbon economy is already being felt by the worldrsquos poorest.A green recovery that places carbon reduction and nature restoration at the heart of Scottish Government action makes financial sense. Many studies show how investments like home insulation, electric charging points, promoting cycling and walking, tree planting and habitat restoration provide jobs, address inequality and bring cleaner air and better health.With Government resources stretched by the health crisis, itrsquos more important than ever to use scarce cash to build the greener, fairer society that we need.

If you want to know why pubs, restaurants and shops have not been overrun by punters rushing to spend, spend, spend, it is because they are afraid.As anyone who lived through the late s and early Eighties can testy, they are right to be nervous.

Even though he is a stranger to the dole queue, he made a lot of people relieved that they might not be joining it just yet.Before the pandemic hit, Mr Sunak was best known for replacing his party leader on the General Election televised debates circuit.

This is why handwashing and cleaning are so important.The WHOrsquos technical lead for infection prevention and control, Benedetta Allegranzi, finally conceded yesterday that the organisation cannot rule out evidence emerging of airborne transmission in ldquocrowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings.Just days before, she had downplayed the possibility, insisting it was ldquocertainly not supported by solid or even clear evidence.The change in tone follows an open letter penned by Lidia Morawska, a expert in aerosol science at Queensland University of Technology, and signed by  other scientists.They wrote that ldquohand-washing and social distancing are appropriate, but, in our view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people.Researchers accused the WHO of being ldquoslow and risk-averse in updating its guidance and allowing ldquoa few conservative voices to shout down dissent because it could mean more expensive and disruptive control measures.The issue has attracted more attention from scientists as countries ease their lockdowns by re-opening offices, restaurants, bars and nightclubs.It has also prompted questions about what level of ventilation is needed in workplaces, schools and nursing homes, and whether ultraviolet light should be used to kill the virus indoors ndash as sunlight does outdoors.All this really depends on what proportion of cases are caused by airborne spread, and that is hard to determine.Some scientists back a ldquoprecautionary principle : until the level of risk is known, follow a path of maximum mitigation such as making face masks mandatory in all indoor settings.Others are more cautious.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia told New Scientist that he was worried it would confuse the public into thinking a face mask was a better protection than washing their hands.ldquoI think there probably is some airborne transmission, he added.ldquoThe issue is whether that is important enough to justy additional control measures.: Why GPs in Scotlands most deprived communities fear a tsunami of trouble aheadAll this comes after further doubt was shed on the possibility of herd immunity earlier this week by an updated Lancet study showing that just five per cent of Spainrsquos population has developed antibodies, despite having one of the worldrsquos highest death tolls.Given that seroprevalence of at least % would be required, it was concluded that ldquoherd immunity through natural infection is not only highly unethical, but also unachievable.It is unclear what degree of protection antibodies actually offer anyway, as the study ndash the largest in Europe to date ndash also found that over the course of eight weeks, % of participants who had initially tested positive for antibodies had no trace of them by the end.That is not to say they are not immune ndash they could have cellular immunity instead ndash but it is another of the virusrsquo conundrums.Meanwhile, increasing evidence is also emerging about the long-term consequences of infection with Covid-.Studies have found high rates of lung scarring ndash even those who had mild symptoms ndash and of blood clots leading to strokes, heart attacks, lung embolisms, and limb amputations. Abnormal blood clotting has even been reported in patients who appear to have recovered.Neuropsychiatric complications have also emerged, with a study of  hospital patients in the UK finding that  patients suffered an altered mental state, including encephalitis had a newly diagnosed psychosis and six had dementia-like symptoms such as short-term memory deterioration.

Perhaps Mr Maciver should try it some time. There were a number of statements remarkably free of this approach, Irsquoll confine myself to some of the highlights.He states that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos approach to handling the Covid- epidemic ldquohas been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos. There were six deaths from the disease in Scotland last week. The number of deaths in England was . Given the proximity of the countries and the fact that Scotland has no control over its borders, this is an extraordinary ergence. How could this be achieved with a ldquocarbon copy approach  Let me help Mr Maciver here: it couldnrsquot. Those outcomes were achieved by the Scottish Government strictly following the advice of its scientic advisory body.Mr Maciver believed in  it would have been an act of self-harm to have voted Yes. While the Scottish Government works hard with limited powers to protect him and his family, in the true spirit of the Scottish Enlightenment, he can reflect on the wisdom of that statement, as a hard Brexit looms on the horizon, threatening to redouble the hardships brought about by the virus.Jim Daly, Edinburgh EH.MARK Smithtries valiantly to make the widespread Scottish desire for independence look equivalent to English nationalism. The first rhetorical trick is to call supporters of Scottish independence ldquonationalists. This sleight of hand is so common as to almost escape notice, but in a professional political commentator itrsquos either sloppy or deliberately slippery. Later, he acknowledges that strident types of English, or Scottish, nationalism have been unattractive to many, but he attributes this cooler view only to those in what he calls ldquothe centre ground. Those who support Scottish independence for reasons of bringing democracy closer to the people, or from dismay and disillusion with the seemingly endlessly dysal and self-absorbed Westminster establishment, or any other rational argument, donrsquot seem to enter his thinking.He also doesnrsquot notice that the question in YouGovrsquos poll that puts Tory support for English independence at  per cent is highly misleading in the context of Brexit. It asks how the the respondent would vote in a hypothetical referendum to the question ldquoShould England be an independent country  It surely should be obvious that for that still very large proportion of English people who have dficulty distinguishing between England and the UK, this is a direct echo of the Brexit referendum, and that they would be likely to answer it correspondingly.That of course is YouGovrsquos survey howler, but Mr Smith should have known better than to build his convoluted argument about ldquonationalisms around it. Neither does he address the fact, inconvenient for his thesis, that English Tories apparently tend toEnglish nationalism but Scottish Tories are quite free of Scottish nationalism. He has started, it seems, from his pre-determined conclusion that wanting independence for Scotland is little more than a sentimental, even strident, patriotic reflex, and therefore the same sort of thing as Little Englandism. He might not approve of Scottish independence himself, but that does not excuse such spurious ldquoanalysis.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh EH.IN response to questions directed at me by John Jamiesonas to why Scotland has ldquofailed to thrive compared to England: first, he failed to acknowledge that in my letter of July  I was answering specic nonsensical claims by a previous correspondent and at no stage did I suggest that Scotlandhad not performed as well as rUK, which indeed it has.The problem for an independent Scotland is that we spend nearly  per cent more on public servicesthan England and because of our geography most of our businesses and economic activity are directed towards England ndash approximately %. In other words, provided we remain within the UK internal single market these anomalies do not matter a jot. However, a Scotland with hard borders and outside the lucrative UK market, with a massive borrowing requirement , dferent currency, and outside the EUwould make the proverbial perfect storm look a squall in comparison.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.IN the midst of this continuing independence debate, I consider two questions remain unanswered and unresolved. Will Scottish-born UK passport holders and British citizens living in Scotland be deprived of those rights post-independence And will English-born, but happily-settled, UK citizens living their lives in Scotland be deprived of their rights to retain their UK citizenship and passport and be forced to accept a Scottish versionthey wish to remain living here It is neither democratic nor fair to deprive so many of their birthrights andindependence supporters ndashSNP or otherwise ndash wish to secede from the UK they may well be entitled to do so, but they do not have the right to make others secede against their will and they might display some social democratic principles by acknowledging and answering the above.Gerald Marshall, Kinnesswood.Read more: Letters: Covid cannot mask indy pitfalls for ever"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-trust-young-fix-future","story":"Hopefully, we can learn from past mistakes, and create an approach for youth unemployment that is fit for purpose.

That report set out how much Scotland was going to get through the block grant, all the Barnett consequentials, so it could be worked out.\"They have not published one since , and havent published one covering the measures for Covid-. Not having that one document which sets it all out means you cant see clearly and you have to pull out information from all sorts of reports.

However, a few weeks on, much of what I wrote then is just as relevant now.As a board member of Interface, the organisation which forges valuable relationships between businesses and academics for research and development, I had just taken part in a discussion on the role of businesses in driving innovation.It was prompted by a presentation from Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, and author of the Muscatelli review into the impact on the economy of the higher education sector. It sat alongside an equivalent review into the college sector, The Cumberford and Little Report, exalting the good work of further education establishments on Scotlandrsquos economy and society. Both reviews called for a ldquonational mission to drive innovation, to make Scotland among the most innovative economies in the world.We all have our part to play ndash this is a collective effort of Team Scotland ndashand never more so than now when we are in the midst of a crisis.Businesses are at the heart of innovation, and the development of new products, services and process keeps them a step ahead of competitors, both domestic and overseas. We have seen this during the Covid- crisis, however it is not about having a competitive edge now, but of doing every conceivable thing to help in the battle against an unseen opponent ndash distillers making hand sanitisers, manufacturers making personal protection equipment and companies partnering with university teams to share their knowledge and access specialist facilities to research future treatments and develop vaccines. The response has been impressive and leaves no doubt about how innovative, adaptable and inspirational our businesses and academics are.Our institutions are the engines of knowledge and growth and businesses are the drivers of that growth. Brought together, businesses, universities and colleges can really power ahead, making signicant impacts on society and economy.To give just one example, a couple of years ago, a company supported by Interface spoke at the Interface Strategic Board to help us understand why they had collaborated with academics. What was said really stuck in my mind.Highland Galvanizers and Colour Coaters, which applies coatings to everything from steel sculptures to roadside barriers, collaborated with a Glasgow Caledonian University graduate to address the problem of pinholing ndash when tiny holes appear in the paint. By finding a solution, the company saved pound,-pound, annually.Apart from the ongoing cost savings, having a technical researcher in the business questioning how and why things were done, led to other employees adopting a new perspective of scanning the operation for improvements, which has ultimately increased performance and productivity.Geoff Crowley, development director at the company, said that innovation is now embedded throughout his company, with all staff encouraged to share ideas to improve processes and products as an integral part of their job. As he put it: ldquoCall it innovation,necessary, but actually itrsquos survival. Do things dferently, better, for less, using less resource.That is already happening in many companies across Scotland as they adapt and ersity and is a valuable message for rebuilding, reconstructing, reimagining and reigniting our businesses and the economy.Anyone can identy efficiencies or how to make improvements ndash and linking with our world-leading institutions to businesses can help reach workable solutions.Professor Donald MacRae OBE is a member of Interface Strategic Board"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-drivers-need-accept-consequences-introducing-lethal-machines-road","story":"Many drivers claim that they always do drive with due consideration for vulnerable road users and are outraged by the suggestion that they should be automatically liable for the consequences of any lapses.

And how many ldquocareful drivers comply with the mph speed limit which is specically intended to protect vulnerable road users The effect strict liability has on driver behaviour may be debatable, but it provides many more unarguable advantages. Under the present fault-based system months, sometimes years are spent while claimants lawyers and insurance staff wrangle over where liability lies . In the meantime, there is no mitigation of the economic consequences borne by the victim, a serious consideration in our long-standing hostile environment for welfare benefits. And where a lone cyclist has been hit, where is the evidence of fault to come from  If a motor vehicle is involved any passengers will almost certainly support ldquoour driver. Likewise with lone pedestrians: witnesses may become aware of the incident only when they hear the thump and be unable to say whether the pedestrian carelessly stepped off the pavement without looking or how fast the driver was travelling.Under strict liability the legal wranglingcan be dispensed with as fault is established automatically at the point of impact. With that done the lawyers and medics can then be called in to assess the value of the injury suffered by the victim. That may take some time, but even under the present fault-based system instalments can be paid out by the insurance companies as soon as liability is established.When we drivers exercise the privilege of introducing a couple of tons of potentially death-dealing metal on to public roads we should in fairness accept that we are automatically liable for the consequences regardless of fault.

The new Covid- secure guidance for the hospitality sector and hairdressers meant businesses were able to reopen across England on July , provided they met key criteria. UK Government officials have worked alongside over  key industry stakeholders and trade unions to develop clear plans in line with scientic advice and public health directions, building on existing guidance published in May.The new guidance sets out a range of measures for pubs and restaurants to become Covid- secure, including:Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “We know this pandemic has been particularly hard for people working in hairdressing and hospitality. Allowing pubs, restaurants and hairdressers to open will be another step in our plan to kickstart our economic recovery in a safe manner.”The guidance that is set out provides clear, practical steps businesses can take to open in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers.Separate guidance has been published for hairdressers, which states that a clear visor should be worn by the person providing the service, covering the face and providing a barrier between the wearer and the customer from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking.The government is also consulting with industry on how businesses should record customer information to help keep customers and employees safe and support the new test and trace system.Edinburgh Hair and beauty salon That Rosie Glow is preparing to open for business on July  after almost four months of closure due to the coronavirus lockdown. A number of safety measures will be in place to help prevent the spread of Covid- when the business opens. The salon has already installed clear screens between each treatment station, and at the reception desk.Customers and staff will be asked to wear face coverings, and customers will be requested to visit the salon alone where possible, and arrive on time rather than early to reduce time spent in the waiting area. They will have to keep their coats and belongings with them instead of them being hung up by staff, and there will be no magazines or refreshments available.Each station and any equipment used will be thoroughly cleaned between customers, and clean towels or gowns will be used with each one.Salon owner Rosie Fraser said: “We closed on March , but we have kept our social media active and positive, and kept in touch with clients.” Ms Fraser said she has tried to make the new measures as comfortable as possible, including the screens bearing the salon’s name. vw, px\"  She said: “I wanted to make sure the clients and also the staff felt safe coming back, and we also wanted people to feel like it’s a nice experience and not too clinical.“In this new normal we will be coming into we wanted to have safety but with style so that women still feel like they are having an enjoyable experience.

The Welsh firm – which has a Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales – has ridden many an economic downturn in its illustrious -year-old history. Co-owner Chris Jones, who is great-great grandson of the company’s founder, said: “We take a view that you can get through anything. I think it makes it easier because we’ve been through crises before.”It helped that the Ammanford-based firm had been through five fantastic years before coronavirus struck.

I’m  weeks now. When I found out the salon had to close the first thought was stress, panic, and what is going to happen to my clients. We closed early. We have about  to  clients a day so that is a lot of footfall and I had a real concern about safety.”Claire and her team have been busy getting the salon ready to welcome back her valued customers.With the rearrangement of the salon to allow social distancing, the introduction of PPE, risk assessment and team training, Claire is ready for the influx of people who are desperate for a haircut after the long months of lockdown.Claire said: “The guidelines are good. We have posters up with the guidelines on them and I have held a team meeting to carry out a risk assessment and explain to the staff what is expected of them.“Hand sanitisers have been installed and everywhere has been thoroughly cleaned.”The UK Government has published guidance to support businesses to reopen and keep workers and customers safe so they feel confident to .at gov.uk coronavirus-business-reopening.If you run a business and would like to know which of the coronavirus support schemes you are eligible for, you can use the business support finder tool.

Everyone is in the same boat trying to step-up and deliver.“Before anyone had heard of Covid- we were already planning to equip GP practices for appointments and started that in October last year.”On March  national guidance was issued asking boards to accelerate the roll-out of the technology in an effort to curb the spread of the virus across the country.Kenny added: “Ultimately the increase in Near Me appointments has protected both our patients and staff from possible infection. We were looking to gradually introduce it but events over took that. We have trained more than  clinicians in range of specialisms since then.“There are benefits to Near Me over phone consultations and evidence shows visually you can pick-up signs and body language far more than on a phone call. So where it is clinically appropriate to do so we are having as many of these using Near Me as possible.“The initial focus was on enabling GP Practices, attention was shted to Mental Health Services, AHP and other clinical services traditionally delivered from the Balfour as the pandemic response developed. Working closely with service leads, training was delivered, equipment put in place and appointment processes modied to mirror the GP roll-out.“Uptake from both patients and clinicians has been very encouraging. Our Mental Health service has been able to meet the demands within the community at a time of increased anxiety and isolation.”He added that the uptake across the entire Mental Health Team led to them being asked to contribute to a national learning event to share their experiences.“Our maternity service is also doing very well and, despite only recently taking up the use of the technology, was similarly invited to contribute to a future national learning event due to its success,” Kenny said.“GP Simon Kemp from Daisy Villa has been selected, as one of only six practices in Scotland, to be part of a joint project with NHS Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop guidance and help embed virtual appointment within GP practices across Scotland.“Near Me isn#t just about a response to Covid- – it was around before the pandemic. The trick for us is going to be to embed it and it can be the new normal in the future as we continue to protect our community.“For Orkney it has many benefits including providing care closer to home and reducing spend in relation to off island patient travel.“Going forward we will be targeting specialities where we have high numbers of patients travelling – sometimes on a three day round trip. We will work closely with our partner boards to ensure that the recent momentum continues and that the virtual clinic option becomes #business as usual#, where it is clinically appropriate to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were aimed at informing communities about the process around the closure of their local church, and the future options for the buildings.Unfortunately only the Sand Church event, on the West Side on Thursday th March was able to take place.As a result the Rev Fran Henderson, transition minister for the Shetland parish, has now invited all interested people to take part in an online buildings consultation to ensure all views are reflected.Dr Henderson said: “Ideally, we would have had face-to-face public community meetings about the upcoming closures, but unfortunately only one – at Sand Church – was able to go ahead due to the lockdown measures.“We are concerned that communities need to have their say on what’s going to happen to our church buildings when they are sold, so we have therefore moved our public consultation online.“No guarantees can be made, but alongside our legal duties as charity trustees, all suggestions and requests received will be taken fully into consideration as we make decisions about the future of these buildings and their contents.”The newly launched buildings consultation surveys are composed of  questions each, with some slight iations according to local circumstances.

this time to do battle in the Glamaig Stableford competition.Only two played in the competition won by Sandi Beatson # that#s three-in-a-row for her.The boys to come out to play and play they most certainly did in earnest competition for the RNLI Shield.There was a very good turnout on the Saturday of this weekend competition with the weather conditions certainly predicted to favour that particular day#s cohort.Covid  restrictions meant that instead of the normal random #draw# for partners players arranged their own #friendship groups# and appropriate tee times on the required booking sheet.Battle commenced # and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

Tha fhios gur e sin pàirt dhen duilgheadas a tha, agus a bhios, daonnan mu choinneamh cuango mar am Bòrd Cò a tha am Bòrd no MG Alba, mar eisimpleir, a’ riochdachadh: Riaghaltas na h-Alba an Dùn Èideann no na coimhearsnachdan Gàidhlig  Esan a phàigheas am pìobaire# Ged a tha mi airson seo a dhèanamh gu math soilleir: gu bheil mi cho moiteil sa ghabhas às gach neach a tha ag obair anns gach buidheann Gàidhliga tha dealasach is dìcheallach a thaobh na cànain agus dhan chultar agus a tha air an t-uàmhas a dhèanamh dhuinn.Gus an tèid urrasan ionadail, mar a tha Soillse a’ moladh, a stèidheachadh anns na coimhearsnachdan, ge-tà, saoilidh mi nach tig an t-adhartas a tha sinn uile a’ miannachadh.  a bhios aca  Ma bhios na h-urrasan air an taghadh gu poblach, cò gheibh bhòt: dìreach daoine aig a bheil Gàidhlig  Dìreach daoine a tha cleachdadh na Gàidhlig gach latha  Cò tha dol a thomhas sin   didsiteach ann gar clàradh, mar ann an saoghal Sheòrais Orwell Am bi bhòt aig a h-uile neach san sgìre, mar a bu chòir, fiù ’s nuair a tha % no % no % dhiubh gun Ghàidhlig agus coma mu deidhinn, no na h-aghaidh An e baile no sgìre no eilean  Mar a thuirt am fear-sgrùdaidh eile, cò tha dol a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  No cò tha dol a sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean a bhios a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  Bha an dearbh dheasbad sin gu math fuilteach aig aon àm eadar Lenin agus Rosa Luxemburg anns an Ruis ag àm an Aramach ann an . ’son an rebholution a’ stiùireadh agus a thoirt air adhart.Chaidh ise a mhurt agus ghlèidh esan an latha, agus bha a’ bhlath air a bhuil.Ach mura creid sinn ann an deamocrasaidh ionadail agus anns na daoine fhèin, chan eil dòchas idir ann. An dèan Riaghaltas na h-Alba strì an aghaidh seo, is iad cho dèidheil air cumhachd a thàladh a-steach dhan mheadhan co-dhiù, mar a tha gach poileasaidh aca thairis na  bliadhna mu dheireadha’ dearbhadh Tha ceistean nas fharsainge ann cuideachd: ceistean a tha mi air togail gach dàrnacha seachdain anns a’ cholbh seo. Tha iad sin ceangailte ri fallaineachd eaconomaigeach nan sgìrean. Mura bheil obraichean ann an Uibhist no anns na Hearadh no ann an Leòdhas no eile, ciamar idir a tha thu dol a chumail òigridh  Agus ma tha obraichean annciamar a nì sinn cinnteach gur e Gàidheila gheibh na h-obraichean sin Oir tha gu leòr de dh’obraichean air a bhith air an cruthachadh as ùr ann an iomadh sgìre thairis na fichead bliadhna chaidh seachad, agus gu tric is e an rud a thachras gun tig Gall air choireigin a-steach a dheànamh na h-obrach sin .Chan eil lagh, moralta no eile, an aghaidh a leithid: cha bhuin an saoghal do dhuine againn. Chan eil e furasta, gun ghuth a ràdh air ceist thaigheadas, far nach fhaigh Gàidheil òga fearann no taigh anns am fuirich iad, eadar prìsean àrd agus margaid mhòr Airbnb.Is dòcha gu bheil cothrom aig A’ Ghàidhealtachd agus aig Na h-Eileanan air toiseach‑tòisichidh ùr a dheanamh a thaobh nan gnothaichean sin ri linn a’ Choròna‑Bhìorais.

Cosnaidhean uaine maireannach seasmhach. Ath-sgaoileadh dhen fhearann. Agus cho riatanach agus a tha e ar cànan a chur aig teas-mheadhan gach gnothach sin. Tha an dol a mach aig an “t-Sianal Gàidhlig” fhèinle còrr is % Beurla air na prògraman acana fhianais gum faod thu ainm no bratach Gàidhlig a thoirt air rud sam bith, ach fhathast gur e rud Gallda th’ ann.

Tha am Bòrd air a ràdh gu bheil an siostam a th’ ann ag obrachadh. Bu chòir dhuinn a bhith draghail gu bheil iad air sin a ràdh gu poblach.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

The Dailyhas reported that firms may receive subsidies from HMRC to help them deal with extra checks as result of the Irish Sea border.It is expected that the payments would last for two years to support businesses with new administrative processes.When the Brexit transition period ends on January  Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, while the rest of the UK will not.Earlier this week the UK Government submitted applications to the EU to create Border Control Posts at Northern Ireland#s ports.This will allow products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain to be checked.There will also be a £m fund to help companies across the UK train their staff and upgrade their IT systems to make them compatible with the Government#s Good Vehicle Movement Service .The system will manage goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and will be mainly used by lorry and haulage firms.It will involve hauliers entering good#s safety, security, transport and export declarations to generate a code which can then be presented at ports to streamline the process, it will also be used to determine which loads need to undergo checks. The Government hopes to introduce a pilot scheme in November and have it fully operational by January .\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbac .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_baa-f--be-dfcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"International Trade Secretary Liz Truss  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has said the Government#s Brexit border plan could undermine Northern Ireland#s place in the UK#s customs territory.Business Insider revealed that Ms Truss wrote to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove on Wednesday to express four key areas of concern. She detailed concern at how the new border border plans could affect Northern Ireland.“I understand that the digital delivery of the dual tarf system [both EU and UK tarf] in Northern Ireland is a high risk and that HMRC are planning to apply the EU tarf as a default to all imports in Northern Ireland on January , ,” Ms Truss said.“This is very concerning as this may call into question Northern Ireland’s place in the UK customs territory. Failure to deliver the UK tarf digitally in Northern Ireland would have political, legal and reputational risks.”She also expressed concern about a potential World Trade Organization challenge to the UK#s border regime when the transition period ends.“This is especially relevant concerning the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and the application of the staged approach,” the International Trade Secretary said.“These measures could signicantly impact on the UK’s reputation at the WTO and I would appreciate your assurance that full border checks for EU-GB goods will be implemented no later than July  and that all messaging will clearly reflect this point.” Belfast Most ReadBelfast City Council chiefs# quit threat over Bobby Storey funeral rowFear and loathing in Crossgar... but was village#s #local lockdown# really necessary Parades Commission reroutes Belfast parade due to #potential disorder#Belfast hospital patient who hasn#t had a visitor since start of lockdown tests positive for coronavirus Noah Donohoe dad: The son I never met,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the review team said the issues indicated system-wide problems and that the issues uncovered were unlikely to be unique to those three areas. Additional problems, mistakes and tragedies may have occurred in the healthcare system, the authors said. In Northern Ireland around , women have had vaginal mesh implants, and around  of them were involved in the Sling the Mesh campaign.Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who chaired the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, described how women#s lives had been turned upside down by surgical mesh, adding: They told us about experiencing splintered glass inside them, razors inside them, in their bodies. And that gave them permanent, unremitting pain. She added: We travelled around the UK and met over  women and their families and I have to say, it made such a lasting impression on us. And some of those stories, I will certainly take to my grave. Their experiences were harrowing. We learnt about damaged families under immense strain, relationships that have been destroyed and careers broken. And as a result, financial ruin. A number of mesh-injured women said their doctors, surgeons or GPs ignored or dismissed their concerns. Some clinicians# reactions ranged from it#s all in your head to these are women#s issues or it#s that time of le, the report states. For the women concerned this was tantamount to a complete denial of their concerns and being written off by a system that was supposed to care. The review says women have also raised concerns about missing or altered medical records. And many said they were told the treatment was a new gold standard. The treatment has been used in the pelvis for  years, but the review said that its long-term risk profile is still unknown. Mr Swann said the report highlighted failures in the healthcare system, including the need to listen and understand patients# voices and concerns they had raised around certain treatments. While the focus of the report is on the healthcare system in England, it is recognised that many women from here took the time to submit their experience thereby highlighting similar failures within our service, he said.Mr Swann added: I must apologise to these women and others who were similarly affected, on behalf of the system, and I must offer my thanks to those women for taking the time to highlight these concerns to the review.While our healthcare system does treat the majority of patients safely, the message is that we can do better. We will now give this review report the full and careful consideration it deserves within the local and national context.Belfast Most ReadBelfast City Council chiefs# quit threat over Bobby Storey funeral rowFear and loathing in Crossgar... but was village#s #local lockdown# really necessary Parades Commission reroutes Belfast parade due to #potential disorder#Belfast hospital patient who hasn#t had a visitor since start of lockdown tests positive for coronavirus Noah Donohoe dad: The son I never met,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a potential for public disorder.Read More All eyes will be on us: Loyalists urge bonfire organisers to follow coronavirus regulations The north Belfast parade is one of three to have been so far categorised as sensitive by the commission, which was informed last month by the Attorney General that it had no legal powers to prevent parades from taking place.As the Twelfth falls on a Sunday this year, official demonstrations were due to take place the next day. However, the Orange Order announced in April it would not hold demonstrations due to the pandemic.More than  loyalist bands have made notications to parade between July  and . The watchdog said the Ballysillan notied route includes a parading area with a history of sensitive parades and it had previously received substantial objections to loyalist marches.The parade has been limited to two-and-a-half hours and it is prohibited from certain residential areas, conditions the commission described as proportionate, necessary and fair.It noted the parade organiser had said they were willing to avoid Squires Hill Road and had prepared a banner reminding supporters not to follow the band, adding leaflets echoing the same message had been distributed to households.Meanwhile, the Stoneyford Somme parade has been told by the commission not to enter Stoneyford village on July , and must only last  minutes. The original notication had requested an hour.The same time limit restriction has been imposed on the local Sons of William Flute Band parade, which is to take place on July  and has been ordered to reroute its outward parade, as well as being prohibited from walking itsroute.The commission noted that the respective organisers of the Stoneyford parades had a history of notying paradesthat do not take place, adding both bands have fewany members, and may exist in name only.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On  May, George Floyd - a black man – was surrounded by four white men in police unorms, all with guns. Three of them stood by while one literally squeezed the le out of him – all the time knowing they were being filmed. We watched this video – like many others globally - and imagined it was our son, our husband, our brother, our friend. It was traumatic. The familiarity and the horror of these images demanded that we raise our voices and demonstrate our anger and pain. But that is the US you might think - it is not like that here. There are not so many black people in Northern Ireland, so it is less visible but systemic racism is pervasive. The qualications of many black nurses working in the NHS are not recognised for further post-graduate study. This is discriminatory and obstructs career development and promotion. While around % of nurses and % of doctors in the NHS are from ethnic minorities, none are senior managers. googletag.cmd.push The fact that we don’t actually know how many black people there are in NI is a symptom of this institutional blindness. We are so unimportant we aren’t even counted. We have been calling for ethnic monitoring for years as part of the Racial Equality Strategy but are yet to see concrete action. On  June, we peacefully protested – to show solidarity with George Floyd but also to raise awareness about racism here. Unlike other large public gatherings during the pandemic, all participants wore masks. Hand sanitizer was available and social distancing was enforced. The messaging about the events stressed public health. googletag.cmd.push But when we arrived at the Guildhall what happened to us  We were intimidated. There were armoured vehicles everywhere. I was surrounded by three white men, all in police unorms, all with guns. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the police are routinely armed. It is also the only part of the UK where organizers and participants in BLM rallies have been prosecuted and fined. We are hurt and disappointed that the PSNI cannot see this. They seem to be sorry that we are upset but incapable of understanding why we’re upset. In their statement on the protest they describe George Floyd’s death as “avoidable and unnecessary”. It was intentional murder. One week after our events, another protest to “protect statues” was organized in Belfast. There were no fines and no prosecutions. When we have challenged the PSNI and the Justice Minister on this blatant double standard we have received confused, contradictory, and inaccurate information. Last week there was another prominent large public gathering. The PSNI have said they are reviewing evidence. The policing style at both these events was markedly dferent – we will raise this with the Equality Commission for possible breach of our human rights. What made our events distinct  There are no elected black politicians in Northern Ireland. Our community is not represented in power sharing institutions. The PSNI demonstrated that they can show understanding of context and nuance when policing majority groups amid this pandemic. Yet the one visible event organized by black people was criminalized from the outset – with additional enforcement powers added to the Coronavirus Regulations rushed into force at pm on  June.  The PSNI have said they support our aims – but do they  The protests were about police violence and impunity. Have they thought about the way black people have historically been criminalized how they are disproportionately stopped and searched why young black men are perceived as dangerous and young women sexually harassed  We have made three demands to the PSNI: - Rescind the fines - Drop the prosecutions - Issue a public apology The PSNI tell us there is nothing they can do. They are hiding behind process arguing that while there is a review by the Police Ombudsman their hands are tied. They want to move forward but after the way we were treated on  June there is no trust. Cressida Dick of the politan police did not hesitate to apologise for the behaviour of her officers who shared selfies of two murdered black women – “ it is as it appears to be” – even though there is an ongoing investigation. She apologized because she knew it was wrong and how damaging such behaviour by police officers is to public trust and community safety. We truly want to work with the police – it is vital we can feel safe, protected, and equal before the law. But we need actions not words. We need the PSNI to demonstrate they can treat us with the same sensitivity and understanding they treat majority communities.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The issue of redeveloping the derelict Meenan Square site has dragged on for a number of years. Controversial bonfires have been built at the site in the past and over recent weeks materials have been gathered and burned on a regular basis. In February, The Executive Officethrough its Urban Villages Initiative said it was working with Apex Housing Association and other statutory agencies to take forward plans to ‘transform’ the site. googletag.cmd.push This would incorporate youth and community facilities, social housing and small commercial units. At that time locals, including workers at Denis’s Wee Shop and councillors for the Moor area confirmed to the Derry News that people had been asked to vacate premises to allow for demolition of the buildings. The Bogside Inn was supposed to be part of the second phase of redevelopment – possibly years down the line. Demolition work has not yet taken place and TEO was asked why there are further delays. A spokesperson for TEO said: “The Meenan Square site is privately owned and the Department understands the owner did ask businesses to vacate the site in recent months. googletag.cmd.push “Work is continuing by the Department’s Urban Villages team and other stakeholders to allow for development of the site, however plans will be subject to business case and other statutory approvals and community consultation before any construction work can commence.” HEALTH HAZARD Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said there are several long- and short-term issues that need resolved to deal with the re-development of the Meenan Square site in the Bogside which has become a source of anti-social activity. Karen Mullan MLA said “It’s very apparent that there are short and long-term issues that need to be resolved at this scar site at Meenan Square. “I and Councillor Patricia Logue are dealing with problems around this site on an ongoing basis. “It is a health hazard and an eyesore for the residents of the area who have to look at it daily and deal with the anti-community activity that takes place there. “There must be a collective effort over the summer period to deal with the recurring problems at this site which includes the illegal dumping of materials, the subsequent burning of those materials, the impact it is having in the area and the serious health hazards this throws up.” She added: “There are also child protection issues with some very young children and teenagers being in around a very dangerous site hrs a day. “In relation to any future plans for this site I fully understand the processes involved and that they take time and like everything they have been impacted by the onset of the Coronavirus Crisis and the change of ownership. But all bodies have a responsibility to prioritise this development. “Over the past number of years myself and Cllr Patricia have worked intensely with the owners, the local community, Iona Enterprises, Dove House Community Trust, The Executive Office , Urban Villages and Council to progress the site to development and had hoped that demolition would have taken place before now. “The residents in the immediate area have suffered for too long as this site has been allowed to fall into neglect and dereliction. “I am confident that everyone involved is committed to delivering the proposed regeneration project that we all desire. “I would urge all the stakeholders to redouble their efforts and commitments to ensure that this community gets the facilities and services that the redeveloped Meenan Park will deliver.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was scary, even for an introvert like me who didn’t mind staying at home – the notion that there would be no end in sight struck at our collective sense of normality – what was safe, what was normal  Most of the towns bars and clubs took the selfless decision to close from th March and whilst the guidance from governments was just gearing up, Derry slowly went into hibernation. About two weeks in, I thought to myself ‘this must be nearing an end’ but I was wrong, in fact it was getting worse and we all watched with, in my case, genuine fear as the numbers of those infected and those who had sadly lost their lives mounted each night for days and weeks. googletag.cmd.push I should say that my lockdown has been at the lower end of the stress scale. I don’t have children to feed or home school and I can work from home. Whilst having that level of free time, however, I exhausted my in-house options fairly quickly. I painted the house, reconfigured rooms and did someDIY. After about the fth week indoors though, I had a lot more time to sit and observe the lives of others, whether through social media or the news, and I would love to be able to just pause at that point and look at how we all coped. googletag.cmd.push I watched as people drted away from the scornful, reality-tv fuelled selfishness that had increasingly eaten away at that old spirit of community Derry was once famous for. My facebook was overloaded with scenes of kindness and understanding. Neighbours looking out for one another, umpteen tonnes of banana bread being offered as gts and when all the distraction of shopping, going for pints and buying the latest gear was removed, we all reverted to our default settings. Nature was once again our playground, family was again the lynchpin that held it all together and our st century blinkers came off, maybe for the first time in some of our lives. It was the best of us. I say that in no way to gloss over the loss of members of our families and our communities. There will always be a void left by those who we couldn’t mourn properly and lay to rest in our traditional ways. I think we owe it to their memories to try and capture the things that changed us over the last few months and apply it to how we will come out of this. Remember that it was during this time that nurses and doctors, not reality tv wannabes that put their shoulder to the wheel. Remember the gratitude we all shared every day and the fervour we showed in demanding that they be paid better  We shouldn’t forget that just because our amazon deliveries are back to normal, or because Primark has again opened. Hundreds and thousands of meals were prepared for those in need across the city, and whilst at the time I am sure we all thought this was fantastic, look below the surface and ask yourself why in  there are people in our town who can’t afford to feed themselves or their families. Lockdown exposed a lot about the society we live in, good and bad. If we can harness the good, we can take the initiative away from people like bungling Boris and force the issue of looking after our key workers, paying a decent wage and this time, keep that community spirit alive. I thought prior to lockdown that we were too far gone, I learned dferent. I learned what was important and most importantly – who. I didn’t need politicians, I needed the Iceland delivery driver. I didn’t need ‘influencers’, I needed my local chemist and I certainly didn’t need constant social media trolling, I needed my postwoman. Now don’t get me wrong, there were a few days there where I would have done anything for a cold pint, and its only natural that we want to be able to go and do the things we are used to, but there is a real genuine opportunity for us to plot the course out of the pandemic and out of the depressing situation the world is in by just remembering we are all human and we are all caring and responsible people at heart.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was scary, even for an introvert like me who didn’t mind staying at home – the notion that there would be no end in sight struck at our collective sense of normality – what was safe, what was normal  Most of the towns bars and clubs took the selfless decision to close from th March and whilst the guidance from governments was just gearing up, Derry slowly went into hibernation. About two weeks in, I thought to myself ‘this must be nearing an end’ but I was wrong, in fact it was getting worse and we all watched with, in my case, genuine fear as the numbers of those infected and those who had sadly lost their lives mounted each night for days and weeks. googletag.cmd.push I should say that my lockdown has been at the lower end of the stress scale. I don’t have children to feed or home school and I can work from home. Whilst having that level of free time, however, I exhausted my in-house options fairly quickly. I painted the house, reconfigured rooms and did someDIY. After about the fth week indoors though, I had a lot more time to sit and observe the lives of others, whether through social media or the news, and I would love to be able to just pause at that point and look at how we all coped. googletag.cmd.push I watched as people drted away from the scornful, reality-tv fuelled selfishness that had increasingly eaten away at that old spirit of community Derry was once famous for. My facebook was overloaded with scenes of kindness and understanding. Neighbours looking out for one another, umpteen tonnes of banana bread being offered as gts and when all the distraction of shopping, going for pints and buying the latest gear was removed, we all reverted to our default settings. Nature was once again our playground, family was again the lynchpin that held it all together and our st century blinkers came off, maybe for the first time in some of our lives. It was the best of us. I say that in no way to gloss over the loss of members of our families and our communities. There will always be a void left by those who we couldn’t mourn properly and lay to rest in our traditional ways. I think we owe it to their memories to try and capture the things that changed us over the last few months and apply it to how we will come out of this. Remember that it was during this time that nurses and doctors, not reality tv wannabes that put their shoulder to the wheel. Remember the gratitude we all shared every day and the fervour we showed in demanding that they be paid better  We shouldn’t forget that just because our amazon deliveries are back to normal, or because Primark has again opened. Hundreds and thousands of meals were prepared for those in need across the city, and whilst at the time I am sure we all thought this was fantastic, look below the surface and ask yourself why in  there are people in our town who can’t afford to feed themselves or their families. Lockdown exposed a lot about the society we live in, good and bad. If we can harness the good, we can take the initiative away from people like bungling Boris and force the issue of looking after our key workers, paying a decent wage and this time, keep that community spirit alive. I thought prior to lockdown that we were too far gone, I learned dferent. I learned what was important and most importantly – who. I didn’t need politicians, I needed the Iceland delivery driver. I didn’t need ‘influencers’, I needed my local chemist and I certainly didn’t need constant social media trolling, I needed my postwoman. Now don’t get me wrong, there were a few days there where I would have done anything for a cold pint, and its only natural that we want to be able to go and do the things we are used to, but there is a real genuine opportunity for us to plot the course out of the pandemic and out of the depressing situation the world is in by just remembering we are all human and we are all caring and responsible people at heart.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly after the announcement, the Derry News asked the General Medical Councilto confirm whether that now means the Medical School will open in September of next year. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, and funding is just one part of the decision process. We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September  later this summer, following completion of all these stages.” googletag.cmd.push The GMC carried out a stage  visit to the Magee Campus last July, and so, the next step is to make the stage  decision. That involves a decision to commit resources to rolling quality assurance and to allow the school to recruit students. From that point on it would be a case of monitoring the schools progress before a decision is made which will allow the school toaward its own primary medical qualications. Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton has welcomed the funding assurances for a graduate medical school in Derry. Mr Middleton said: “It is welcome news that the Department for the Economy has been allocated funding from the Executive for the graduate medical school. poundmillion of capital expenditure and poundmillion revenue costs per annum will be ring-fenced. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. googletag.cmd.push This is a further step forward to ensuring that in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” Since the announcement by Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill that a medical school had been approved, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoken of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a  opening date. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan has also welcomed confirmation from the Executive that funding for the Magee Medical School is ring-fenced allowing the project to move to the next stage. The Foyle MLA said: “Confirmation from the Executive that funding for the medical school at Magee University is ring-fenced is great news for the city. “This will allow the University to press ahead and recruit staff and students for the proposed opening date of September . “It will also enable Ulster University to move to the next stage of the General Medical Council process, with their visit to the Magee campus later this month. “The delivery of the graduate entry medical school will not only enable us to produce doctors to serve our local communities, it will be an important economic driver for the whole North West Region.” LARGER EXPANSION Meanwhile, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MP has said that the allocation of funding to the Graduate Entry Medical School in Derry must now see a confirmation that the school will open for an intake in September . The Foyle MP said that the SDLP efforts to secure resource for the Medical School must be the first step in a larger expansion of university provision in the North West. Colum Eastwood MP said: “I’m pleased that funding secured by the SDLP in the New Decade, New Approach negotiations will now be provided to deliver on the promise of a graduate entry medical school in Derry. The people of this city have been denied better university provision for far too long. This was a priority for us when we decided to go back into the Executive and I’m delighted we’ve been able to see progress. “This is good news and we’ll work with all parties in the Executive to meet the target for a September  intake. We need to come together and send a message to our young people that we’re doing everything we can to provide them with the opportunity to live, work and study at home. Our young people are our greatest strength, they shouldn’t be our largest export. “This must represent a first step in a larger expansion of university provision in the North West. We need to be ambitious for Derry and the wider region, investing in skills is critical to transforming our economy. That’s why as MP, I’m committed to working with the Executive and the new Irish Government to deliver new opportunities and enhance higher learning institutions on a cross border basis to meet the needs of people here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Allowing pubs, restaurants and hairdressers to open will be another step in our plan to kickstart our economic recovery in a safe manner.” The guidance that is set out provides clear, practical steps businesses can take to open in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers. Separate guidance has been published for hairdressers, which states that a clear visor should be worn by the person providing the service, covering the face and providing a barrier between the wearer and the customer from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking. The government is also consulting with industry on how businesses should record customer information to help keep customers and employees safe and support the new test and trace system.

But Claire, her staff and her customers are delighted that the Lisburn business is reopening after putting safety measures in place. Claire first opened the Barber’s Den four years ago and such was its popularity she also decided to expand to include The Hairdresser’s Den for all the ladies of Lisburn. When they had to put the business on hold due to the Covid- pandemic, it was an understandably worrying time for Claire and her staff. She said: “I am heavily pregnant. I’m  weeks now. When I found out the salon had to close the first thought was stress, panic, and what is going to happen to my clients. We closed early. We have about  to  clients a day so that is a lot of footfall and I had a real concern about safety.” Claire and her team have been busy getting the salon ready to welcome back her valued customers. With the rearrangement of the salon to allow social distancing, the introduction of PPE, risk assessment and team training, Claire is ready for the influx of people who are desperate for a haircut after the long months of lockdown.  Claire said: “The guidelines are good. We have posters up with the guidelines on them and I have held a team meeting to carry out a risk assessment and explain to the staff what is expected of them. “Hand sanitisers have been installed and everywhere has been thoroughly cleaned. “There are face coverings and shields for the staff and we will provide coverings for the customersthey would prefer to wear them. We also have gloves and aprons for the staff. “We are advising people to make appointments butthere is a ‘walk in’ I have been advised that I don’t have to turn them away.” ‘Clients and staff will feel safe in our salon’ CASE STUDY THAT ROSIE GLOW Edinburgh Hair and beauty salon That Rosie Glow is preparing to open for business on July  after almost four months of closure. A number of safety measures will be in place to help prevent the spread of Covid- when the business opens. The salon has already installed clear screens between each treatment station, and at the reception desk. Customers and staff will be asked to wear face coverings, and customers will be requested to visit the salon alone where possible, and arrive on time rather than early to reduce time spent in the waiting area. They will have to keep their coats and belongings with them instead of them being hung up by staff, and there will be no magazines or refreshments available.Each station and any equipment used will be thoroughly cleaned between customers, and clean towels or gowns will be used with each one.  Salon owner Rosie Fraser said: “We closed on March , but we have kept our social media active and positive, and kept in touch with clients.” The salon, which opened in January , has nine members of staff who are all self-employed. Ms Fraser said she has tried to make the new measures as comfortable as possible, including the screens bearing the salon’s name. She said: “I wanted to make sure the clients and also the staff felt safe coming back, and we also wanted people to feel like it’s a nice experience and not too clinical. In this new normal we will be coming into we wanted to have safety but with style so that women still feel like they are having an enjoyable experience.” ‘Orders starting to pick up once again’ CASE STUDY CORGI When lockdown was announced, luxury knitwear company Corgi knew they had the experience to get through the Covid- crisis. The Welsh firm – which has a Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales – has ridden many an economic downturn in its illustrious -year-old history. Co-owner Chris Jones, who is great-great grandson of the company’s founder, said: “We take a view that you can get through anything. I think it makes it easier because we’ve been through crises before.” It helped that the Ammanford-based firm had been through five fantastic years before coronavirus struck. In March they furloughed  of their  staff but now many are ing as orders begin to pick up. Corgi makes hand-finished wool, cotton and cashmere socks and other knitwear and Chris said: “Normally we run two shts on the sock machine, so we kept going with one. Next week going back to one and a half shts – we’re going to have the other knitters coming in some of the time.”  LOOKING UP: Corgi co-owner Chris Jones With shops reopening, old customers are beginning to ask for new sales catalogues and Chris expects business to pick up properly in around a month. What has helped the business survive more than anything though was the package of financial help the Government made available. Chris said: “The furlough scheme has practically saved us. Without it, we’d have been in a lot of trouble or we’d have managed but we’d have had to let a lot of people go.” Go to visitbritain gb en know-before-you-go to plan your great days out --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it.

Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This happened just as the fishing season began, leaving many fishermen with questions over the viability of their livelihood, and absolutely no income during lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger.

A garden wall was demolished as the bus turned into Bryansford Road and two telegraph poles near the tennis courts were broken.Another wall was badly damaged before the bus turned into Tullybrannigan Road and it then entered Shan Slieve Drive, demolishing a hedge.The bus continued past Bonnyrsquos caravan park and along the fullof the upper stretches of Tullybrannigan Road before becoming jammed into the narrow Priestrsquos Bridge.ldquoPolice had by that stage caught up with the bus by following the trail of oil which was being thrown out from the engine, said the RUC spokesperson.A man was arrested at the scene.ANNACLOY mdash A  year-old Annacloy student has overcome a lelong disability to be hailed as one of the best Queenrsquos University graduates this year.Bronagh Byrne is deaf, but she has refused to let this be an obstacle in her pursuit of academic excellence.Her determination proved worthwhile this week when she was awarded a first class honours degree in economics and presented with the McKane medal for proficiency.But this is not the young studentrsquos first time in the headlines, for just three years ago she delighted staff at Assumption Grammar School, Ballynahinch, when she scooped straight As in her A-Levels.Bronagh has put the success of her degree down to hard work and lot of help from Sharon Eason of the Joint University Deaf Education group.ldquoShe was absolutely brilliant, admitted Bronaghrsquos mother, Angela, following Mondayrsquos graduation ceremony. ldquoSharon made sure everything ran smoothly for Bronagh who relies totally on lip reading, in informing her lecturers and asking them to face her at all times.DOWNPATRICK mdash Bottles, fireworks and broken fence posts were thrown at police during a controversial Loyalist band parade in Downpatrick on Friday night.Trouble flared towards the end of the Red Hand Defenders annual parade which has been banned from entraining any part of the town by order of the Parades Commission.Loyalist supporters, angered by the Commissionrsquos ruling that the parade be restricted to the Belfast Road, threw several dozen bottles, a handful of fireworks and pieces of a ripped up fence before police cleared the road.Four policemen suffered minor injuries in the operation and one girl had her wrist broken by a police baton.Downpatrickrsquos largest ever security operation was put in place in anticipation of two parades on Friday night.In addition to the band parade, the Down Peace Forum, a residentsrsquo group which wants all Loyalist parades banned from Downpatrick, had signalled its intention to hold a counter demonstration.However, the residentsrsquo demonstration did not take place, leaving over  police officers,  soldiers and a police spotter plan to concentrate on the Loyalist parade.DRUMANESS mdash Drumaness Primary School has been congratulated by education inspectors for its ldquoclear sense of communityrsquorsquo.The focused inspection reported highlighted the positive relationships which exist between teachers, parents and children at the local school.The principal, Mrs Deirdre McCann, was found to place strong emphasis on, ldquodeveloping the caring ethos of the school, while teachers were described as, ldquocaring and committed.The children were seen to be courteous and spoke warmly about their teachers and experiences of school.According to the report, the schoolrsquos pastoral care policies ensure the safety and well-being of children, while a range of reward systems motivate the children by rewarding effort and achievement.ldquoThe vast majority of parents expressed their confidence in the education their children were receiving, the report continued.SAUL ndash A Saul designerrsquos hat topped the polls recently at the highly fashionable Royal Ascot race meeting.Hilary McCool has gone a long way since she first decided to take an artistic path just a few years ago.But the  year-old student has taken no time to make her mark in designer circles, and her hat was recently chosen by the London College of Fashion to be modelled by television celebrity Anthea Turner at Royal Ascot.The hat was immediately spotted by fashion experts as a ldquopiece de resistancersquorsquo, and was awarded first in its category.Hilary, who is partially sighted, does not let her disability stand in her way. Even though she see the world in black and white, her eye for fine lines and designs is by no means hindered.DUNDRUM mdash Details of Dundrumrsquos millennium festival, which takes place from Saturday, August , to Saturday, August , were fine tuned last night in the final summer meeting of the village committee.Organisers of the event have urged local people to volunteer their help throughout the week to ensure that as many events go ahead as possible.Medieval banquets, childrenrsquos fun days, pigeon racing and a iety of competitions look likely to keep residents and visitors entertained throughout the week.But the committeersquos secretary, Elaine Armstrong, has warned that other events, like the glamorous granny competition, may not be given the go-aheadthere are not enough volunteers on the day.BALLYDUGAN mdash History has turned full circle for a forgotten piece of local architecture which will reopen its doors this month, this time as a place of leisure rather than labour.Over two centuries since the huge wheel at Ballydugan Mill began turning, the gates will open on one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative projects.The seven floor pound, complex includes a restaurant, cafe, hotel, banquet hall and historical exhibition, all set within the arearsquos most impressive countryside.It is the brainchild of Noel Killen, a local contractor renowned for his love of traditional Irish buildings, who bought the deserted giant  years ago with the dream of restoring it to its former majesty.According to Noel, the old mill will become just the second venue in Northern Ireland to host traditional medieval banquets in which will be a wholly unique setting.PORTAFERRY mdash A local Assembly member has expressed his disgust after a stretch of shoreline in Portaferry was polluted with oil last week.Alliance member Kieran McCarthy was speaking following the oil leak which occurred on a stretch of foreshore between the Saltpans and Cook Street last Thursday evening.ldquoStrangford Lough is our most precious asset, indeed, it is regarded as Northern Irelandrsquos special area and everything must be done to ensure that the lough and its environs are protected,rsquorsquo he said.ldquoIt would appear that the oil leakage may have come from the land side of the Lough and found its way on to the foreshore via a large surface water pipe.rsquorsquoGOLF mdash Seamus Agnew motored to victory in Clement Milliganrsquos Captainrsquos Day at Ardglass Golf Club on Saturday.The  handicapper shot the round of his le for  points to pip Stephen McDowell, last yearrsquos winner, on a better back nine..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Heritage railway hopes for £40%2C000 funding  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway has launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, amid warnings that it could remain closed for the rest of the year.Officials at the award-winning heritage railway mdash which has been hit hard by coronavirus restrictions mdash say the cash is needed to help it get back on track and hope people will weigh in with support for the new fighting fund.A recent bid for financial support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions failed.Railway officials said the bid lodged for financial support was submitted on a Friday and rejected the following Monday, much to their disappointment.And while Stormont finance minister Conor Murphy last week announced details of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment, the local railway, which enjoyed a record number of visitors last year, fears that none of the cash will trickle down to help it.Railway officials say that the arts and heritage sector has been badly hit by the global pandemic and fears that unlike some other attractions, it may not be able to open for business in a few weeksrsquo time.Heritage railway chairman, Robert Gardiner, has written an open letter highlighting the organisationrsquos plight and its ldquoreluctant need to ask for help in the current financial climate. He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley. Such a project will have the support of everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Kevin making waves in music scene with debut album  ","story":"FIVE years after taking up playing the guitar for the first time at the age of , local man Kevin Young is releasing his first album.Better known as the former owner of Saints Cafe in Saintfield, Kevin has found a new way in le through his music and career in working to help people deal with unresolved emotional trauma.His debut album, Lonely Demon, has already been hailed by BBC Radio Ulster presenter Ralph McLean as a ldquogreat collection of heartfelt, emotional and honest songs.Ralph has played several of Kevinrsquos tracks already ahead of the albumrsquos release on his Local Voices show.Kevin was one of the local performers who took part in the virtual Rock Down concert recently which raised pound, for the mental health charity Downpatrick PIPS.He is fast making a name for himself on the local music scene and already has amassed some devoted fans.Like many artists trying to get funding off the ground for a new creative project, Kevin opened up a crowdfunding appeal on Kickstarter. He raised more than pound, in just six days from funders, some of the subscribers coming from as far away as Australia.Kevin says that part of his journey into music is really about understanding what would give him joy in le.He explained: ldquoI now work as a professional practitioner of compassionate inquiry after selling up the cafe. Thatrsquos really about helping people improve their emotional wellbeing and to deal with any trauma-based issues they might have.ldquoWhen I was running the cafe, I would also do business consultancy and advise people on business aspects of opening a cafe. The more I did it, the more I realised that there was a lot of emotional problems that some people had which were holding them back and thatrsquos where they really needed some help. I began to study this type of psychotherapeutic approach developed by Dr Gabor Mateacute and realised that I wanted to do more. Tapping into his innate ability to connect with people and understand them also reawakened long-held creativity in Kevin and a desire to express himself.ldquoI often tell people that itrsquos never too late to do what you really want to do and change your le, he said. ldquoIrsquove always been into music but never got involved but I decided to learn how to play guitar when I turned  as I thought thatI donrsquot do it now, I never will. I also felt that I needed to practice what I preached.Over the years, Kevin has slowly emerged as a songwriter and has written some deeply personal lyrics to his alternative folk sounding album.ldquoThe songs are about issues such as addiction, darkness, depression, loss, lost love and death. The album is quite dark in them but Irsquove been told that people really relate to the music and words and find it uplting.One of Kevinrsquos earlier tracks released was Painted Son, which was well received.His first single off Lonely Demon, called I Love Only You mdash one of the rare love songs on the album mdash was written with his we Sharon in mind, who has lent her voice on backing vocals on all the tracks.The single is now available on the music , Bandcamp.Kevin has worked with music producer, Michael Mormecha of Tree Son Studios in Hillsborough, to record the album.Kickstarter funders will receive the album in a few weeksrsquo time ahead of its general release..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Martina guides pilgrims around St Patrick’s Way  ","story":"SEVEN people with a spiritual sense of adventure arrived in Downpatrick to walk the Saint Patrick Centrersquos new initiative, St Patrickrsquos Way mdash a pilgrimage route linking the seven sites in Downpatrick associated with the patron saint.Seven is said to be Godrsquos perfect number. ldquoItrsquos a good start, I thought, as I welcomed these brave souls. ldquoGuinea pilgrims, I called them light-heartedly. It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows. Teas were hurried made as the pilgrims, led by Elaine, looking like Rocky Balboa, triumphantly made their way towards the centre.ldquoIt was an amazing experience, declared the journalist who later said he had the energy to walk his love and woke up feeling refreshed. He loved it! Hillaryrsquos boots which had mounted Kilimanjaro started to fall apart on Slieve Patrick but she was rejoicing.The husband and we team from Belfast  ldquoAstounding, exclaimed Marion, joyfully, exhausted but glad to have made it. ldquoYou just need to tell people itrsquos longer, said her husband, Jim.The next dayrsquos pilgrimage, with a few adjustments, had everyone back at .pm.And Elaine and I received some lovely messages including one from Colette, graciously thanking us. ldquoWalking with you on St Patrickrsquos Way. It was an experience I wouldnrsquot have missed.We have  fully booked for July . Thank God! I was afraid I would have to move to Bangor to promote Columbanus.Martina Purdy, a former BBC correspondent and Adoration Sister, is now a pilgrim guide and public relations consultant for the St Patrick Centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th July 2020 Murlough.jpg","title":"Ruairi signs deal with The Ports  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN striker Ruairi Croskery has signed for newly promoted Dankse Bank Premiership side Portadown.The  year-old has signed a two year contract at Shamrock Park ahead of the - season.Croskery spent four years at Manchester United and featured in the same Un- squad as current first team stars Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay.After his spell at Old Trafford he ed back to Northern Ireland to sign for Linfield.

Yet this is who the BBC is betraying.“This decision by the BBC is a further demonstration of a corporate elite who run the BBC being out of touch with the consumer.I appreciate that the bill for subsidising over-s is over £m of the BBC’s budget but the corporate management of the BBC command huge salaries to resolve these matters. “This problem didn’t arise overnight.There should have been better planning rather than the organisation being left standing with empty hands at the fty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour. “This once again raises the question of the BBC’s funding model.The BBC is part of my British identity, but it has been mismanaged for decades which has led to this funding dilemma.“Despite having a more stable funding arrangement than its rivals, the BBC is failing to put itself on a better commercial footing and ease its burden on the taxpayer.The current Charter ends in  and there must be a real meaningful debate now at the mid term about the funding modelthe BBC is to survive for future generations.”BBC Chairman Sir David Clementi said the decision had “not been easy”, but the broadcaster is under “under severe financial pressure” and a further delay would have had an impact on programmes.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

George and Casehill Woods near Dinas Powys, has resulted in success.National Resources Waleshad proposed constructing a dam m wide and .m high in the meadow at the Woodland Trust site in Dinas Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

stationrsquos Facebook followers are invited to a live online QA session.It is hoped that people will be able to share their memories of the leboat and the contribution that the station has made to

soon a better lsquostationrsquo was developed in the deckchair storebefore moving to its current home, a purpose built station opened in .Gareth Wigmore, one of the first crew members in  and now station president said the leboat was pushed by the crew along the seafront, which at the time wasnrsquot even one way.ldquoWe were as keen as mustard, pleased to be doing our bit for the community, but we had rudimentary equipment back then, he said.ldquoSome of our protective equipment was made by the local community.Crew member Karl Lawrence, with  yearsrsquo experience with the RNLI, said: ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south end of the Esplanade we have installed a training room which is ideal for providing training in a warm, well-lit and stable room, prior to practicing on often rough seas in the leboats.ldquoMy favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again for service, we gather on our balcony drinking tea or coffee, watching the sun rise and exchanging with each other our plans for the day ahead, before most other people have woken up.Celebrating the

ldquoIt makes no dferencethe role people have played is to crew the boats, to assist launch on shore, provide community safety advice, run our shops or fundraise, everyone plays a vital role in saving lives.ldquoThe RNLI is funded by donations and receives no government funding, soyou are a fundraiser, a member of our shop team, a local business who supports us or a member of the community who has donated or raised funds you have help us to save lives.ldquoWe are all one leboat crew and we are part of the community of Penarth.ldquoThe RNLI is built of the vision that ldquowith courage, nothing

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

The co-consecrators along with myself will be the Bishop of Meath and Kildare and the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. The preacher will be the Rt Revd Kenneth Clarke, formerly Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.“Because it is likely that churches will still be operating under strict rules of social distancing in September, attendance will be limited to the family, close friends and colleagues of the bishop-elect, with an opportunity for a more expansive liturgical event at a future date in Belfast Cathedral. However, the service in Armagh will be streamed and recorded.“I would ask you to keep the bishop-elect and his family in your prayers as he prepares for his episcopal ordination.”Speaking in February, Mr Davison said: “The members of the Electoral College for the Diocese of Connor have done me a great honour in electing me to serve as the next bishop of the diocese. \u2028I am very conscious of the great responsibility that is being entrusted to me.”The bishop-elect succeeds the Rt Revd Alan Abernethy who retired at the end of December. Mr Davison was ordained in  and began his ministry in the Diocese of Armagh as Curate of St Mark’s, Portadown . He has served as Rector of Carrickfergus since  and Archdeacon of Belfast since .Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Armagh also announced the Episcopal Electoral College for the Diocese of Clogher will have its first meeting on Wednesday, September , in St Macartin’s Cathedral, Enniskillen, commencing with a service of Holy Communion at .am.--A message from the EditorThank you for reading this story on our website.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fefaadfcbdbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcddeabdbbfcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
