While general practice looks very different to how it did 20 months ago, it is under pressure like never before, and practices are delivering 2.7million more appointments a month than before the pandemic. \u0027Meanwhile we have lost the equivalent of 1,700 full-time, fully-qualified GPs since 2015.\u0027With current workload reaching unmanageable levels, and amid plummeting staff morale, there is an urgent need to address how quality and safety can be guaranteed. This means all work must be appropriately commissioned and properly resourced.\u0027Inappropriate and unfunded workload takes GPs and their staff away from caring for the core needs of patients, and also wastes appointments which could be available for other ill patients needing to see their GP.\u0027Before announcing he would step down, Dr Vautrey, a GP in Leeds, said doctors should \u0027not feel pressured to return to a traditional ten-minute treadmill of face-to-face consultations\u0027 and urged them not to take on new patients. Latest figures show four in ten GP appointments were still not being carried out face-to-face in England this September. For comparison, over the same period two years ago, before the pandemic struck, more than nine in ten were in person.Health Secretary Sajid Javid last month unveiled a £250million package of measures to get patients more face-to-face appointments, including a controversial proposal that would effectively \u0027name and shame\u0027 underperforming surgeries.The BMA launched an indicative ballot of GP practices in England, asking if they support taking industrial action in four key areas.

The show, which brings in audiences of up to 9 million, is crucial to Channel 4’s offering to advertisers and forms the backbone of its commercial strategy. While the value of the new deal with the Bake Off maker, Love Productions, has not been disclosed, Channel 4 paid £75m for its first three-year deal when it poached the show from the BBC in 2016. “We are thrilled that Channel 4 will continue to serve up Bake Off’s unique combination of warmth, humour and soggy bottoms for years to come,” said Ian Katz, Channel 4’s chief content officer.

Alibaba and JD reported strong sales of items such as electric appliances, electronics, pet supplies, and cosmetics and other personal-care goods.

That’s a decline since late October, when one in 50 people in England were thought to have a Covid infection. A drop has also been recorded in Wales, although in Scotland the rate of people testing positive has remained level and the trend is unclear in Northern Ireland. While the decline in England was across all age groups and in most regions of the country, it appears the trend is strongest among older children. However, the question remains whether infection levels will rise once more now schools have returned from recent half-terms, or whether – as some have argued – growing levels of immunity in children could mean a peak has been reached. “With a marked decrease in infections among secondary schoolchildren in England, the half-term break may have played a part, though infections were decreasing prior to this time,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey. “Over the next few weeks we will see if this decline continues.” More on this story here: Rossi described the loss of the ski season as a tragedy for the small town and others in Susa valley, Piedmont, especially after the 2020 season had also been cut short. But as the resort prepares to reopen in early December, he is cautiously optimistic. “Three times during last year’s season we were ready to start – we prepared the slopes, hired staff – only for it all to get cancelled,” said Rossi, who is vice-president of Bardonecchia’s tourism consortium. “It was very disappointing. But the prospects for this year are looking good. Bookings are coming in, mainly from Italy, and the pandemic situation is different let’s hope nothing changes.” Some Italian ski slopes have already opened, albeit with the requirement to present the Covid-19 health pass when using ski lifts, reduced capacity in cabins and social-distancing measures at ticket offices. Masks must be worn on ski lifts and in “common areas” as part of the protocols agreed by the Italian ski industry. “Customers aren’t complaining – the desire to ski is much greater than the annoyance of having to abide by the rules,” said Herbert Tovagliari, the president and chief executive of Cervinia Spa, a travel and tourism company in Aosta valley. Read the full story here: The country, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in European Union, was the first in the bloc to reimpose a lockdown this autumn as a surge in Covid cases threatens to overwhelm its health system. The restrictions on vaccine-rejecting lawmakers, which includes docking their pay, was supported by 62 of its 100 lawmakers, and will last from Monday until mid-2022. State television reported that nine MPs have rejected the vaccine. The ban on unvaccinated MPs in parliament was necessary to promote public confidence in the government’s policies to control Covid infections, the legislation’s sponsor, the lawmaker Janis Rancans, was cited as saying by the parliamentary press service. The country of 1.9 million people has reported 236,765 infections and 3,646 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began.GSK said it would now speak to global regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration, about potential approval for the new method of administration, known as intramuscular injection, which can be carried out by family doctors and spare patients a trip to hospital. Sotrovimab is authorised for emergency use in the US to prevent mild or moderate cases of Covid from worsening. The European Medicines Agency has given its go-ahead for use by member states, though EU-wide approval is still outstanding. Similar products are offered or being developed by Eli Lilly, Regeneron and AstraZeneca. Eli Lilly’s therapy is so far given only by infusion, or drip. AstraZeneca’s antibody drug, under review to possibly prevent infections, is delivered by intramuscular shot only. Regeneron and Roche’s product can be given as an infusion or injection under the skin, typically in the abdomen.Spahn announced a return to free testing from Saturday and plans to introduce a so-called 2G Plus rule, according to which people would have to be vaccinated or recovered in addition to producing a negative test in order to attend cultural, sporting and other gatherings. The government declared neighbouring Austria, Czech Republic and Hungary to be high-risk areas, recommending Germans avoid travelling there.  Germany recorded a record infection rate for three days in a row this week. On Friday a further almost 49,000 cases were registered, slightly down on the previous day. But numbers are doubling every week and some hospitals are reporting being on the verge of not being able to cope. The government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, called for the cancellation of major events, just as the carnival season gets under way and the Christmas markets are about to open.  Its head, Prof Lothar Wieler, speaking at a joint press conference this morning in Berlin with Spahn, said the fourth wave “is rolling on full power” describing the situation as “five minutes past 12”. He added: “I for one will not be going to any New Years Eve party.” In an effort to boost a flagging vaccine campaign, including encouraging top-up jabs, Spahn said doctors would receive €28 instead of €20 per jab, and a further bonus of €8 for jabs given at the weekend. In the Netherlands, the government was expected to announce new lockdown measures on Friday after a record number of daily infections there – 16,364 – were registered.  According to media reports, there are plans for a three-week raft of restrictions including a 7pm closing time for restaurants, pubs and non-essential shops and a restriction on the size of private gatherings in households to just four additional people. In Saxony, eastern Germany, where some of the highest numbers are being registered and the state with the lowest number of vaccinated people, similar to Thuringia and Bavaria, most unvaccinated there was anger on Friday after the state leader, Michael Kretschmer, called for the cancellation of Christmas markets for the second year in a row, which were due to open from next week.  This is recognised as potentially politically disastrous as the markets have a symbolic value in Germany as high as foreign holidays and a huge economic clout.  Meanwhile, in Cologne, the mayor has defended her decision to allow the carnival season to begin. Carnival-related events were seen as mass spreader opportunities at the start of the pandemic.As more focus turns to administering a booster campaign - public messaging on which has been virtually non-existent so far, the Max Planck Institute said a rollout could help to break this fourth wave, which, owing to the spread of the Delta variant, is more aggressive than any previous wave. Meanwhile, the Marburger Bund, the association representing a large number of German doctors has reported that its members are facing increasing aggression from patients in hospitals, particularly from those who have chosen not to be vaccinated.  There are growing reports of patients attacking doctors verbally and physically and of some demanding a range of alternative therapies that are not usually available under the public healthcare system.“It’s five minutes past midnight,” said Prof Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), as the country was braced for new restrictions to contain a ferocious fourth Covid wave. Related: Scholz pushes new measures to tackle Germany’s rising Covid cases Germany registered more than 48,000 new cases over the past 24 hours, RKI data showed, a day after breaching the 50,000 mark for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The weekly infection rate has soared to an all-time high of 263.7 per 100,000 people, and intensive care beds are filling up rapidly. Several German cities kicked off months-long carnival celebrations on Thursday, with revellers required to prove they are fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid before entering the party zones. The country’s much-loved Christmas market season is also on its way. Related: German Christmas markets face second year of closures as Covid rates soar But Wieler said large gatherings “must be viewed very critically” and in some situations “clearly should be cancelled”. Indoor celebrations especially can act as super-spreader events “and everyone must really think about whether they want to expose themselves to that risk,” he told reporters in Berlin. Related: Covid: Germany enveloped in ‘massive’ pandemic of the unvaccinated Austria has introduced rules that bar unvaccinated people from certain events and indoor venues. The Netherlands is planning a renewed “partial lockdown” as cases hit record levels. The German health minister, Jens Spahn, speaking alongside Wieler, said the situation in the country “is serious”. He recommended that large gatherings be made safer by requiring the vaccinated and recovered to test negative before taking part, while barring the unvaccinated altogether - a system known as 2G Plus in Germany. The federal government and leaders of Germany’s 16 regional states are meeting next Thursday to discuss joint measures to combat the pandemic, after criticism of a confusing patchwork of different restrictions emerging. Among the proposed measures are stricter curbs on the unvaccinated, for instance by excluding them from indoor dining or venues such as cinemas, gyms and theatres , which some states are already doing. “We must do everything needed to break the current trend,” Spahn said, adding:  AstraZeneca made a commitment to sell the shot developed with Oxford University at cost during the pandemic, and in a press conference on Friday it said low-income countries would continue to receive the vaccine on a no-profit basis, while a post-pandemic commercial approach would apply to other new orders even as infections in Europe rise again. “We started this project to help ... but we also said that at some stage in the future, we will transition to commercial orders,” the chief executive, Pascal Soriot, told journalists. Soriot said the virus was becoming endemic, a term for a background level of infections that is part of everyday life. Talks about new orders with undisclosed countries were under way, mainly for delivery next year, with some prospective customers focusing on booster shots, he said. AstraZeneca announced plans this week to set up a separate unit to focus on its coronavirus efforts and other respiratory infections. It said on Friday the unit would independently manage production and distribution.  AstraZeneca said a profit boost from the vaccine in the fourth quarter would make up for costs related to its antibody cocktail for preventing and treating Covid, as it stuck with its earnings forecast for the year. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has had a tumultuous journey, with its not-for-profit strategy and challenges around efficacy data, supplies and links to rare blood clots, fuelling speculation on whether it would want to keep the business in the long term. The drugmaker and its Indian manufacturing partner, Serum Institute, have supplied more than 1.5bn vaccine doses as of the end of September, compared with more than 2 billion from the rival alliance of PfizerBioNTech. Pfizer this month forecast 2021 and 2022 sales from its Covid vaccine of at least $65bn overall, topping estimates. However, Moderna slashed its 2021 sales outlook for its shot by as much as $5bn owing to production hiccups. Including sales from the vaccine in the fourth quarter, AstraZeneca expects 2021 revenues to grow by a mid-to-high 20s percentage. It previously expected sales to grow by a low-20s percentage excluding the shot. Analysts, on average, were expecting third-quarter profit of $1.28 per share on sales of $9.4bn, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Schallenberg did not say when the lockdown would take effect, but the two provinces hardest-hit by this wave of infections, Upper Austria and Salzburg, have said they will introduce the measure for themselves on Monday. “The aim is very clear: that we give the green light this Sunday for a nationwide lockdown for the unvaccinated,” Schallenberg told a news conference, adding that intensive-care units are increasingly strained. “The development is such that I do not think it is sensible to wait ... We will take this step now and my wish is that we take this step on Sunday and nationally for all nine provinces.” Schallenberg said on Thursday those not fully vaccinated would face the same restrictions on their daily movements that the whole country endured in three lockdowns last year.  He said he wants to avoid a repeat of such restrictions on the whole population. More on this story here: Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that about one in 60 people in private households in England had Covid-19 in the week to 6 November, down from one in 50 the previous week. One in 60 is the equivalent of about 925,400 people and is slightly below the proportion who were estimated to have coronavirus at the peak of the second wave in early January, suggesting infection levels are still high. In Wales, about one in 45 people is estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week to 6 November, down from one in 40 the previous week. In Northern Ireland, the figure is about one in 75 people, down from one in 65 the previous week. In Scotland it is one in 85, down from one in 80 the previous week. The ONS said rates in England have decreased in the latest week for all age groups, except for those from school year 12 to age 24 and for people aged 35 to 49, where the trend is uncertain. In late September, Norway ended the last of its coronavirus lockdown measures, which for 18 months had restricted social interaction and hobbled many businesses. The country is not going back into lockdown however, Støre, told a news conference. The new measures include a requirement for adults who have been in contact with a positive case to be tested, and unvaccinated health workers will have to be tested twice a week and wear masks. Local restrictions had reappeared in recent days in Norway, with daily cases at around 1,500 in a country of 5.4 million people. The government will also propose a third vaccine dose for people over 18. Norway uses vaccines made by BioNTech, Pfizer and Moderna in its national rollout, which since September includes everyone aged 12 and over.The prime minister, Pravind Jugnauth, announced the restrictions in a televised address to the country on Thursday, blaming people who were not abiding by health protocols for the increase in infections. He said: Mauritius had fully opened its doors to international visitors at the start of October, hoping to rebuild its vital tourism industry after months of isolation because of the pandemic. But according to latest figures reported to the World Health Organization on Friday, Mauritius has registered 18,979 cases and 240 deaths compared with about 15,695 infections and 84 deaths on 1 October. Many of the new cases are linked to the Delta variant, according to the health ministry. Schools were closed this week, with all classes to be held online, while bars and discos have been ordered to shut and concerts and sporting competitions banned. The government is also limiting numbers of people attending gatherings such as weddings, funerals and rallies, but said beaches would be open, although picnics are prohibited. In his address, Jugnauth highlighted the importance of the Covid jab and urged people to receive booster shots. But he told parliament on Tuesday that since the start of the year, 61 fully vaccinated people had died in hospital in Mauritius.

Athletes and other Games-related personnel will also be enveloped in a “closed loop” bubble. “We will still let the person take part in training and activities related to the games, but (the inidual) needs to go though strict health monitoring and Covid-19 testing every day,” Huang said, referring to the first athlete who tested positive.The pass must be used for a month to enter nightclubs, cafes, party buses and to be seated indoor in restaurants. It was originally introduced on 1 July but was removed on 10 September, when the outbreak was apparently under control because of a high rate of vaccination. People aged 15 and over must also use the pass when attending outdoor events where the number of people exceeds 2,000. Associated Press reports that Denmark, like many other countries, has recorded an increase in cases, with health authorities saying the number of infections and hospitalisations has risen faster than expected. On Tuesday, the Danish parliament’s all-party epidemic committee unanimously approved a decision to once again call the outbreak “a socially critical disease” and approved the reintroduction of the pass. In addition, the Danish broadcast DR has said the government, the confederations of trade unions and employers have reached a deal making it possible for employers to demand that employees show the digital pass at work. The deal must be approved by parliament, most likely next week."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 ireland joins alliance to phase out oil and gas production","story":"In the penultimate day of Cop26 nerves are rising among activists and delegates at what will be left in or out of the final document.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdIn a highly significant move at Cop26 an alliance of countries has committed to phasing out production of oil and gas – and is to push for an international agreement on setting an end date for the exploration and extraction of the fossil fuels.The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which Ireland has joined, is a first in an international climate process which up to now has focused on limiting carbon emissions from fossil fuels rather than turning off the tap. The 2015 Paris Agreement did not even mention fossil fuels, which generated 91 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions in 2020.The alliance is seeking to curtail new licensing and undertake other measures to phase out oil and gas production in line with the Paris accord. Ireland joined Costa Rica Denmark, France, Greenland, Quebec, Sweden, Wales, California and New Zealand in making the milestone announcement.Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: “Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally.”“Through the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new exploration activities for oil and gas. There is no longer a legal basis for granting new licences,” he underlined. In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, “we are also currently legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale”, Mr Ryan confirmed. Founding members “committing to end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds, and promoting dialogue on the need for a managed and just phase-out”. Mr Ryan added: “By prohibiting offshore oil and gas exploration, not only are we doing what we need to do to address climate change, we are also protecting our bioersity which is intrinsically linked to climate change. There are other impacts. For example, scientific research demonstrates that the seismic activity that accompanies exploration and drilling has significant environmental effects.”No futureDenmark and Costa Rica led the initiative. Denmark’s minister for climate, energy, and utilities Dan Jorgensen said that it was expensive for his country as it was the largest producer of oil in the EU but “we do it because we believe we need to”.“There’s no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world,” he added.Costa Rica’s environment minister Andrea Meza said the alliance was about early movers showing courage, “backed by concrete actions”.“It’s a big deal,” said Harro van Assel of Stockholm Environment Institute. “It’s the first time governments are committing together to phase down oil and gas production.”Jerry Mac Evilly, head of polity at Friends of the Earth Ireland said Ireland’s participation in BOGA was hugely positive. “Ireland has taken important steps in recent years to phase out fossil fuels, from ending new oil and gas exploration, to banning onshore fracking. However with the new alliance we are now finally seeing domestic progress being reflected in foreign policy.” He added: “The fossil fuel era must be brought to an end and this means leaving fossil fuels in the ground. This new alliance is an opportunity for Ireland to show leadership and end the reckless expansion of oil and gas at home and abroad.”Meanwhile the Government has also announced €2 million to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition which aims at cutting short-lived pollutants including methane and to reduce air pollution – an initiative that has been led by US climate envoy John Kerry.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdProtesters move through the restricted Blue Zone area of the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow on Friday. Photograph: Jane BarlowPAThe Cop26 negotiations have generated a second draft of an agreement calling for 197 countries to submit stronger emissions-reduction plans next year – but undertakings on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsides have been weakened.The latest draft, which emerged after 7am on Friday, has raised new issues, centring around language, commitments and timings for climate action over the next decade. This suggests a difficult 24 hours ahead if a meaningful outcome is to be secured.The second version of the text includes a request that countries come back by the end of next year with revised emission-reduction targets outlined in their “national determined contributions” – this, in effect, indicates commitments made by signatory countries up to this point are insufficient to contain global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees this century.The text has been criticised for lack of detail on future payments from the rich countries that are primarily responsible for global warming to the poorer countries that will take the brunt of worsening storms, droughts and floods and rising sea levels – these are under the climate finance, adaptation and loss and damage headings.Irish climate expert and Cop veteran Prof John Sweeney told The  the latest text was “watered down terribly overnight” notably the language on fossil fuels and coal had been made ambiguous. This is backing away from a call to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely in the earlier draft.Prof Sweeney said the latest version seemed like “the tail wagging the dog” and it remains to be seen if the European Union side will now come out and impose red lines in an effort to strengthen the outcome. “There is now agreement to keep 1.5 degrees alive in my view,” he added – though he welcomed a request to come back with strengthened commitments by the end of next year.‘Huge loopholes’“While the words ‘coal’ and ‘fossil fuels’ have remained in the new draft decision, huge new loopholes have been introduced that see these efforts significantly weakened,” said Murray Worthy, gas campaign leader at NGO Global Witness.He added: “The aim to phase out all fossil fuel subsidies has now been rowed back to just ‘inefficient’ subsidies – which begs the question of what an efficient use of public money to bankroll the fossil fuel industry could possibly be. This term has been used at the G7 and the G20, but never been properly defined, and leaves an enormous space for countries to claim their subsidies aren’t ‘inefficient’.”The latest draft proposal from the meeting’s chair calls on countries to accelerate “the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels”.While the chair’s proposal will undergo further negotiation at the talks, officially due to end Friday, the change in wording suggested a shift away from unconditional demands that some big fossil fuel-exporting nations have objected to.In addition, delegates and experts have expressed alarm over the chasm between carbon targets and the deep cuts necessary to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.Current national plans would lead to 2.4 degrees of heating, according to analysis this week by Climate Action Tracker. To close that gap, the new draft text “requests” governments issue new 2030 climate plans by the end of 2022 a shift from Wednesday’s draft text which used the verb “urges”.In response to reports from negotiations that finance pledges to poorer nations made in 2009 will not be met even with an extended deadline, Global Witness’s head of forest policy Veronica Oakeshott said: “Nothing illustrates the failure of governments to align their policies and actions with the challenges of the climate crisis better than the contrast between the gaping hole in finance for the most affected countries and the massive financial flows going towards deforestation and fossil fuels.”ImprovementsThere is, nonetheless, improvements in the potential agreement on adaptation to help developing countries become more climate resilient in the face of inevitable impacts from global heating.In addition, nature’s role in reaching the 1.5-degree goal has been recognised in the UNFCCC draft text. It “recognises the interlinked global crises of climate change and bioersity loss” and “emphasises the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring nature and ecosystems to achieve the Paris Agreement climate goal”.It also recognises the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring nature to deliver crucial services that reduce vulnerability to climate impacts and support sustainable livelihoods.The text also “recognises the need to strengthen ocean-based action to tackle climate change” – an issue that had been pushed by Ireland at Cop26.“It’s significant that the new text recognises nature’s role in climate mitigation and adaptation because without nature, we can’t meet the 1.5-degree Paris Agreement target,” said John Verdieck, director of international climate policy at The Nature Conservancy.He added: “While the cover note lacks some of the forward-looking ambition we’d like to see, over the last two weeks an unprecedented level of commitments has been made to protect, restore and manage forests, plus recognise the role of indigenous people in this process.”At this point there was a need to strengthen ongoing texts for finance, transparency and markets “to help governments deliver on Cop26 promises and ensure a liveable Earth system”, Mr Verdieck suggested."},{"url":null,"title":"ennis named as winner of tidy towns competition","story":"Ennis, Co Clare: winner of the 2021 Supervalu National Tidy Towns awards.  Photograph: Getty ImagesEnnis in Co Clare has been named the winner of the 2021 Supervalu National Tidy Towns awards. The competition returned this year, after it was cancelled for the first time in 60 years in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.There were 847 entries in this year’s competition, the results of which were announced in the RDS on Friday afternoon.Cormac McCarthy, chairman of Ennis’ Tidy Towns committee, said they were “over the moon” to have won the award. “Ennis always ranked really highly, but you’re up against amazing groups,” he said.Mr McCarthy added that while the competition didn’t proceed last year, the volunteers continued their work, illustrating that “doing work for the benefit of the local community is the primary driver”.Among some of the measures recognised by the judges was the county town’s water bottle refilling station and the walking bus, which is where school children walk together towards the national school.The group also dropped off litter pickers and bags to around 30 families during the lockdown periods to help reduce the number of masks and gloves that were being littered in the local area.They have also connected with the local direct provision centre, the residents of which are “an integral part” of the submission, Mr McCarthy added.Various categoriesMinister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys, was joined by Ray Kelly, marketing director of Supervalu, to present the awards.Honourees were awarded across various categories including: village and small town urban centre climate action and air quality award inclusive communities and school award winner.Abbeyleix, Co Laois, Glaslough, Co Monaghan, Kilsheelan, in Tipperary South and Ennis in Co Clare each won a regional award.Geashill in Co Offaly was named Ireland’s tidiest village in 2021, while Abbeyleix in Co Laois was crowned Ireland’s tidiest small town.Ireland’s tidiest large town was awarded to Cobh in Co Cork, and Ireland’s tidiest large urban centre was given to Ennis in Co Clare.There was a record number of special awards this year, the organisers said.Cobh, Co Cork, won the national prize for the Covid-19 community award, while Rush in Co Dublin won the EPA circular economy award.Buncrana in Co Donegal was awarded the All-Ireland national pollinator plan award.Minister Humphreys said the pandemic did not stop the thousands of Tidy Town volunteers from “doing what they do best”.“To all of the volunteers... today is very much your day. You should all be extremely proud of your efforts over the last 12 months,” she added.The 2021 competition took place in the same format as previous years, albeit with a specific emphasis on electronic entry and remote adjudication of each town’s entry, the organisers said. Minister Humphreys also announced a €1.5 million fund to support the tidy towns groups in the lead up to next year’s competition."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Of some 240 known wetland species, almost 70 have been listed for Red List protectionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"plan to deliver paris climate goals could be agreed this week cop26 hears","story":"Frans Timmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, said it would be a ‘very bad signal’ if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement. Photograph: Robert PerryEPAThe rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement could be completed at the Cop26 in Glasgow this week, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said.He said completing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of this week’s summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he told a press conference in Glasgow. “I think there is a positive dynamic, and I see a growing sense among fellow leaders that we need to find agreement. We in the European Union continue to work to keep the momentum going and hopefully drive it to the highest possible level of ambition.” Most of the rulebook has been agreed since 2018 but a number of key issues remain unresolved, notably on the regulation of carbon markets where emissions are traded. Completing the rulebook would be a major success for Cop26, which is due to end by 6pm on Friday but Mr Timmermans warned it would be a “very bad signal” if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit’s final statement . “It took the world a while to understand. I remember even some of our member-states only a couple of years ago saying coal is forever. And now every member state of European Union knows that there is no future in coal. “I think the sense of urgency has increased and the understanding that fossil fuels are part of the problem has increased. But if you remove it from the text, what is the message you’re sending then? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of the dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” he said. The EU has faced charges of hypocrisy over its investment in dozens of gas infrastructure projects at the same time that it is calling in Glasgow for an end to fossil fuels. But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. “Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality. “Now, what we need to do with our investments is to make sure that the investments in the infrastructure that will be needed for natural gas are pre-fitted to also be able to carry decarbonated or green gases so that the density of different gases can be transported through this infrastructure,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"young voices among the excluded at cop26 claims irish activist","story":"Extinction Rebellion members protest outside the main Cop26 entrance in Glasgow. Photograph: EPA Voices of young people continue to be excluded from United Nations climate summits when they should be heard in negotiation rooms, according to Valery Molay of the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI)On that basis, Cop26 was lacking something, said the NYCI climate justice officer who is among a large group of young Irish climate activists in Glasgow. “It’s the 26th Cop so at some point you have to ask yourself the question, ‘are we going to keep on coming and talking about this all the time?’ ” she asked.It had been established that global warming was a systemic problem. But when young activists came to Cop26 solutions were still being considered in the framework of business as usual, said Ms Molay. “So where are the justice and equity elements in that?” she asked.Personally, she found it upsetting that the EU bloc in talking about “loss and damage”, and increasing adaptation targets, was doing so within a framework of charity. She added: “Is it charity or reparation that we are talking out?”To solve the climate crisis was not just about cutting greenhouse gases, she said. “It must be while changing the system that created the problem in the first place.” The Irish activists had an hour-long meeting with Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan in Glasgow, where she said the exclusion issue was highlighted, whereby young people could not get into the negotiation room or hear what was going on.Ms Molay said it was emotional for her hearing from people at the meeting talking about themselves and how overwhelming the climate issue was, as indicated by one person saying, “I started this at 13, now I’m going to college, I can’t continue doing this”.“They are sick and tired of assemblies and then nothing happens after that,” she noted.‘At home in Ireland’She welcomed a commitment by Mr Ryan to raise the issue of appropriate language with lead negotiators on loss and damage and his undertaking to examine how youth engagement can be improved “at home in Ireland”.The young climate activists met chairwoman of the Elders Mary Robinson at the conclusion the meeting. The former president said she was glad to have met them as well as other young people form every continent during Cop26.“Every single one them said they’re so tired they’re exhausted. We talked about their self-care,” said Mrs Robinson. Others must prove this is not the case, she insisted. Mrs Robinson introduced the Irish group to former UK prime minister Gordon Brown who was at Cop26 to make a “final push” for countries to agree on $100 billion (€87 billion) a year for poorer countries to tackle change, to avoid the summit being branded a failure. He compared the current system of trying to secure the long-promised climate finance annually for developing countries to “a charity fundraiser or a begging bowl going around the table”."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 pressure builds on eu to get climate deal over the line","story":"In the penultimate day of Cop26 nerves are rising among activists and delegates at what will be left in or out of the final document.

Photograph:  Andrew MilliganPA The Cop26 summit is facing into tortuous final hours as negotiators attempt to strengthen a declaration and add greater urgency in the global response to the climate crisis – with most pressure on the EU to get it across the line.With 197 countries locked in negotiations over a second version of a draft agreement, a flurry of small protests were staged inside the Cop26 venue, at its periphery and throughout the city. Activists deflated the tyres of about 60 4X4s in the city’s west end in protest at the cars’ high levels of emissions.Announcements made in Glasgow “on forests, methane, clean technology and more” were encouraging, Mr Guterres said. “But they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represents a glaring injustice for the developing world.” “Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions as measured by the IMF,” he added, “Or when countries are still building coal plants. Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition – we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator.” ‘Vulnerable countries’If the EU does not lead and build the high-ambition coalition needed, no one else will, the independent European climate think tank E3G said on Thursday night. “There is an immediate opportunity for the EU to leverage the political momentum from week one and the US-China statement to build the confidence that the trillions will be mobilised for developing and vulnerable countries for the net-zero and climate-resilient transformation we need.” Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia were reported to be resisting efforts to strengthen emission-reduction requirements, while vulnerable countries were seeking more robust commitments on adaptation, loss and damage and climate finance and going beyond the issue of delivering on $100 billion a year, to include “mobilising the trillions through the whole global financial architecture”, it added. European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said removing a text reference on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies would be an extremely bad signal – a view strongly echoed by Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan. “If you remove it from the text, what is the message you are sending there? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,” Mr Timmermans added.‘Close to abyss’He said the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate agreement could be completed at Cop26. Agreeing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of the summit. “It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,” he said.Mr Ryan, who is negotiating on behalf of the EU, said at a briefing the climate finance issue might be the last item to get across the line, with expectation that Cop26 will run into the weekend. He confirmed Mr Guterres attended an EU coordination meeting and underlined “when you are close to the abyss, your next step is important”.Irish climate activist and director of FaithInvest Lorna Gold believed the emotional intervention on Thursday by chair of the Elders Mary Robinson “really changed the tone”. “Leading now requires vulnerability cutting through the ‘blah’.

Photograph: VIRGINIA MAYOPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe Government has sought to ease Brexit tensions, insisting there is still time for a deal on the contentious Northern Ireland protocol, ahead of renewed talks on Friday.The European Union’s negotiator Maros Sefcovic is expected to tell his British counterpart David Frost that the negotiations will fail unless the British Government drops its “unattainable” demand over the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).He is to warn that Downing Street needs to “take a step” towards the EU for the talks to be “meaningful”.The meeting in London comes against the backdrop of British warnings in recent weeks that it could trigger article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol.Sources in Dublin said that back channel efforts aimed at finding solutions to the impasse are ongoing.Senior Government figures struck a positive note in public comments on Thursday amid indications that Britain has stepped back from triggering article 16.Taoiseach Micheál Martin told Today FM: “I do believe that in the last number of days there’s a sense of an easing of tension and dialling down the momentum towards invoking article 16 of the protocol.”Separately, speaking in the Dáil, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said efforts will continue to “dissuade the British government from triggering article 16 which I believe would be a really serious, negative and retrograde step”.He said he had spoken this week to one of US president Joe Biden’s most senior advisers and also to members of Congress attending the Cop26 summit in Glasgow including Democratic member of congress Brendan Boyle.Mr Coveney said: “The main focus is to try to encourage progress” in the discussions between Mr Sefcovic and Mr Frost.He said he had listened to what Mr Frost had to say in the House of Lords on Wednesday and added: “I think there is still some time to try to ensure that negotiations and partnership can work.”‘Stay calm’Mr Frost told the House of Lords that article 16 would be Britain’s only option if talks with the EU failed but he promised to continue to negotiate for a number of weeks.He urged the EU to “stay calm and keep things in proportion”.There is concern in Brussels that the British Government has already decided to trigger article 16 in the coming weeks.Retaliatory actions are being prepared with options up to suspending the trade deal agreed last year believed to be under consideration.In October, the EU offered to drastically reduce the number of checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in recognition of the political and economic disruption being caused. But the UK is insisting that the protocol needs a more fundamental redrafting including the removal of the European Court of Justice from its role as arbiter of EU law.“We think that the objectives set out by the UK are unattainable,” said a senior EU official. “The UK position is that the role of the EU’s institution needs to go...

That is also why I raised forcefully that we need to make serious headway in the course of next week.“This is particularly important as regards the issue of medicines. An uninterrupted long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is the protocol-related issue on everyone’s mind in Northern Ireland.”Mr Sefcovic said: “I stand by my commitment to do whatever it takes to address this issue in line with what industry tells us. I prefer to have a joint solution with the UK Government but if we are to amend our own EU legislation – something we are committed to do – we need to find this solution quickly.“We will therefore intensify our talks next week.”‘Serious danger’Earlier Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne said a “tough guy” approach when it comes to Northern Ireland will lead to disaster.Mr Byrne was speaking as EU and UK Brexit negotiators prepare to meet in London for talks on breaking the deadlock over the contentious protocol.He has raised concerns over stability in Northern Ireland, with the UK threatening to trigger Article 16 of the protocol, a move that would suspend parts of the deal that has prevented a hard border on the island of Ireland.Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if there is a serious danger of a full-scale trade war, Mr Byrne said: “There is a serious danger of complete instability in Northern Ireland and that’s what motivates the Irish Government in all of our dealings in relation to the protocol.”He said the countries involved have worked together for decades to ensure stability, saying “we now have a ision, it seems, because of threats by the British Government to, what they say, is to suspend the protocol under Article 16. We’re not entirely clear what that’s about.”Challenged on instability in Northern Ireland and the current arrangements, he said: “I don’t think that the people who are burning buses in Northern Ireland at the moment ... are fully aware of all of the details and the intricacies of the protocol.“What they need to see, and what people in Northern Ireland need to see, is both governments working together.”He said the EU has listened to the concerns of Northern Ireland and is in “solutions mode”, adding: “A tough approach, or a tough guy approach, when it comes to Northern Ireland can only be counter-productive and will lead to disaster.”He said he is “very glad despite that gloomy atmosphere” that there are talks taking place on Friday, adding “there is a prize of stability and peace in Northern Ireland” as well as continuing good diplomatic relations between Britain and the EU.Mr Byrne said the situation in Northern Ireland “is clearly very fragile”.He referenced BBC reporting on “instances of violence, instances of fragility of that peace process this week”.He added: “Further instability will only lead to a continuation of that.“If we can get certainty, if we can get a continuity in trading arrangements, and less of this discussion, what will happen is that the economy in Northern Ireland will prosper and that then helps as well the social situation, which is very, very delicate at the moment.”ChangesIn October, the EU offered a series of changes to the protocol which would remove 80 per cent of checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the UK mainland.But the UK Government wants further alterations, including removing the role of the judges in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the arbitrators of disputes.There is growing speculation that the UK is poised to use a get-out clause from the deal in the coming weeks.Mr Frost told the House of Lords on Wednesday that triggering Article 16 – which would effectively suspend elements of the arrangements – will be the UK’s only option if the dispute is not resolved.He there is “a real opportunity to turn away from confrontation, to move beyond our current difficulties and put in place a new, and better, equilibrium” in the talks.But he added it is “not inevitable” that Article 16 will be triggered.He said: “In my view, this talks process has not reached its end.“Although we have been talking nearly four weeks now, there remain possibilities that the talks have not yet seriously examined, including many approaches suggested by the UK.“There is more to do and I will certainly not give up on this process unless and until it is abundantly clear that nothing more can be done. We are certainly not there yet.“If, however, we do in due course reach that point, the Article 16 safeguards will be our only option.”The Irish Government has held talks with US president Joe Biden’s administration about the protocol.On Thursday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said contact with the US government was designed to “encourage progress” in negotiations.The protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU’s single market for goods, resulting in some checks for products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain. – PA How is Brexit affecting you?

I hope we see progress today.I certainly hope that finishing at six o\u0027clock tonight, which is the plan, would be possible.Equally, I would not be surprised to know that it was going into tomorrow. That\u0027s not unusual at Cop, so nobody should read anything particular into that if it does happen.Nicola Sturgeon said she has not had a chance to properly absorb the new draft of the deal that could be agreed at Cop26 but that, from what she has seen, she would describe it as inching forward, adding that there is time to improve it.Scotland\u0027s First Minister said there has been some incremental progress, telling Sky News: If I was a young person looking into this summit right now I would say it\u0027s not good enough.There may have been inches forward in this latest draft but there\u0027s still time to get it even further forward and to really make the Glasgow Agreement one that lives up to the urgency of the emergency we face.She added: In these final hours, the Prime Minister if necessary should come back here and drive this deal over the line.Asked if she was calling for Boris Johnson to come to Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: If that is what it is going to take, then yes. He was here on Wednesday, I welcomed that. In his shoes, I may have stayed here for the remainder of the summit, but come back... every shoulder to the wheel.I\u0027m not in the negotiating room. That can feel frustrating sometimes. But get there, and make sure that no stone is left unturned in getting this agreement to where it needs to be.Boris Johnson should return to Cop26 to push people on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, Nicola Sturgeon has said.Scotland\u0027s First Minister was speaking after a new draft agreement at the conference was published.She told BBC Breakfast: My message to the Prime Minister is come back here. Use your position as president of this Cop to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them.Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that.She added: The reason I\u0027m singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we\u0027re in the UK - well, it is actually because we\u0027re in the UK, because the UK is the Cop presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK Government.More from NewsWar of the Worlds songwriter battles with sister over £3m inheritanceMedicines breakthrough could unlock Northern Ireland Protocol, says Maros SefcovicRory Cellan-Jones\u0026#39s dog stolen along with five other pets as walker\u0026#39s van was driven away by thieves\u0026#39Freed Britney\u0026#39: Singer could finally be released today from 13-year conservatorshipFrench prosecutors probe rape claims at President Emmanuel Macron\u0026#39s palaceBritish troops helping Poland to fortify border with BelarusMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deselecting corbynistas would good move labour","story":"After such a long and dismal period of lagging behind the government in the polls, Labour activists were given a small boost this week when a second national survey gave their party a mammoth two-point lead. Given the ferocity with which the media and the opposition have been attacking Boris Johnson’s party over “sleaze”, we might have expected a larger turnaround. But a lead’s a lead.Perhaps the champagne was put on hold by the emergence yesterday of another poll reporting that Johnson remains voters’ preferred prime minister, with 37.7 per cent to Keir Starmer’s 29.5.Both these factors – the extraordinarily small swing towards Labour in voting intention and Starmer’s continued personal ratings deficit – suggest that there is something more structural in Labour’s current polling weaknesses. That being the case, then occasional wins in the daily political to-and-fro of the TV or radio studio aren’t going to be enough to snatch victory at the next general election. Given the extended period of Labour’s doldrums, there seems to be something profound that prevents voters flocking to its banner, something that even a week-long scandal about parliamentary corruption has (so far) failed to reverse.A number of issues spring readily to mind. Culturally, Labour remains beholden to woke arguments about race and trans rights, too cautious even to raise a word of support for Professor Kathleen Stock, who was hounded out of her job at Sussex University for having the “wrong” opinions on biology. Even one of their own parliamentary comrades, Rosie Duffield, has been isolated for daring to challenge the Stonewall orthodoxy that insists that “trans women are women”, with not a single Labour MP defending her.Or it could be that Starmer himself is at least part of the problem, having singularly failed to inspire the nation to yearn for an alternative government to Johnson’s. This may or may not be true, but it is not particularly relevant, since Labour never – ever – removes its leaders (unless they happen to have won three elections in a row). Starmer will remain in post, therefore, for as long as he wishes.And there remains a great deal of suspicion about the nature of the parliamentary party and whether Jeremy Corbyn’s replacement by Starmer represented a genuine shift in the political gravity of the party, or was no more than a fresh face on the same old beast.If this latter perception took hold it would be calamitous indeed for Labour’s electoral prospects. Voters – especially former Labour voters who opted for Johnson’s Conservatives in 2019 – need to be reassured that more than the book cover has changed, that it is indeed a brand new, totally revised edition.So if the leader cannot be removed, why not start to make some high-profile changes to the Parliamentary Labour Party? Corbyn himself, provided the party whip is not restored to him this side of the general election, cannot stand as a Labour candidate again. Even if he is successful as an independent candidate, Labour can justifiably distance itself from him.Others in the awkward squad, like John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, may decide to stand down voluntarily anyway (although Abbott denied this week that rumours to that effect were accurate).But the problem for the party lies not with the older generation of MPs in the Campaign Group it lies with those who still have many years of trouble-making and whip-defying ahead of them, those who, in the event of Labour ever gaining power again, would happily march through the lobbies alongside Conservative MPs against the government, just as the current generation did between 1997 and 2010.It is they who frighten the horses far more than the worn out men and women who have had their day in the sun. They are the ones who call for national strikes, who take the side of Hamas terrorists against Israel, who demand workers’ control of industry and the nationalisation of just about everything, and the return of trade union power. And while such demands, in the mouths of student activists, seem cute but tiresome, in the mouths of parliamentarians they are liable to be taken seriously by at least some voters.It is interesting, therefore, that news reports today suggest that the likes of Zarah Sultana, who represents Coventry South, and Poplar \u0026amp Limehouse MP, Apsana Begum, might be at risk of deselection as Labour candidates before the next election.Could this be a move by Starmer’s supporters finally to reshape the PLP in their leader’s image? Has the penny finally dropped that the constant public utterances of Corbyn-supporting MPs does nothing for Labour’s electoral prospects?There is a healthy dose of hypocrisy here, of course. Those on the Left now decrying deselection as a sectarian weapon were the same people who hoped it could be deployed to make the parliamentary party more pro-Corbyn in its makeup. And those hoping to remove Sultana and Begum (and others) would have been outraged at their tactics being used against centrist MPs under Corbyn.But that’s politics. Too often the party’s Right wing have held back from dealing ruthlessly with the hard Left, a cowardice that led directly to the election of Corbyn as leader and two general election defeats – perhaps three, if the shadow of those years proves too difficult to dispel.Labour, foolishly, prides itself on being a “broad church”. But such a congregation can only function if those on the extremes are kept safely away from the pulpit.More from NewsWar of the Worlds songwriter battles with sister over £3m inheritanceMedicines

Covid case numbers is giving us a sunnier outlook for Christmas, a leading modelling expert has said.Coronavirus cases are on their longest unbroken decline since May, according to government data, despite a daily rise in cases on Thursday. And Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) Government advisory group, said the UK was heading in the right direction ahead of the festive season. Last year, millions were forced to shelve their Christmas plans as Britain entered a third national lockdown, but having the whole family around the table for the turkey looks likely this year. Dr Tildesley said: I think I\u0027m certainly more optimistic than I was this time last year. Maybe you probably don\u0027t feel I\u0027m going far enough by saying that, but I\u0027m certainly more optimistic than I was this time last year in that the vaccines are clearly here to help us.We always need to be careful because we know that Covid thrown so many curveballs over the last 18 months now that if we start to see another variant of concern emerge where the vaccines are less effective or it\u0027s much more transmissible again, then things could go in the other direction. But in terms of what we\u0027re seeing now, we compare this time November this year with last year, the trajectory is so much better, which then does put us in hopefully a much better position as we move towards the present.While the University of Warwick professor said we could not rule out some tightening of measures, he said we were a long way away from talking about the idea of a lockdown.  Hopefully more and more people keep going out to get the booster vaccines if we get high uptake in younger people with vaccines, we should hopefully have a much sunnier outlook as we move towards Christmas, he added. New data out on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed around one in 60 people in private households in England had Covid-19 in the week to Nov 6, down from one in 50 the previous week, according to the latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics.One in 60 is the equivalent of about 925,400 people and is slightly below the proportion of people who were estimated to have coronavirus at the peak of the second wave in early January.In Wales, around one in 45 people is estimated to have had Covid-19 in the same week, down from one in 40 the previous week, which had been the highest since estimates began in July 2020.In Northern Ireland, the latest estimate is around one in 75 people, down from one in 65 the previous week and below the record high of one in 40 in mid-August.For Scotland, the latest estimate is one in 85, down from one in 80 the previous week and below September\u0027s peak of one in 45.When modelling the level of Covid-19 infections among different age ranges in England, the ONS said rates have decreased in the latest week for all age groups except for those from school year 12 to age 24 and for people aged 35 to 49, where the trend is uncertain.Rates remained highest for those in school years 7 to 11, at 4.8 per cent.More from NewsWar of the Worlds songwriter

resigns cash honours","story":"Prince Charles’s closest aide has stepped down from his role amid accusations that he helped to secure a knighthood for a donor to the Prince’s charity.Michael Fawcett, who has worked with Prince Charles for four decades, has left his position, Clarence House confirmed on Thursday night.Mr Fawcett began working for the Royal family in 1981, first as a junior footman to the Queen and then a personal valet to her eldest son. He rose through the ranks and in 2018 was made the chief executive of The Prince’s Foundation.Earlier this year, a letter from 2017 emerged in which Mr Fawcett allegedly told a Saudi billionaire who donated £1.5million to the Duke of Wales’s charity that he could help secure him an honour and citizenship.The letter allegedly written to Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfou said: In light of the ongoing and most recent generosity of His Excellency Sheikh Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, I am happy to confirm to you, in confidence, that we are willing and happy to support and contribute to the application for citizenship.“I can further confirm we are willing to make an application to increase His Excellency’s honour from Honorary CBE to that of KBE in accordance with Her Majesty’s Honours Committee.Mr Mahfouz, 51, who is listed as a supporter on The Prince\u0027s Foundation website, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles, specifically Dumfries House and the Castle of Mey in Scotland.In 2016, he was awarded an honorary CBE by the Prince at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Sources close to the Prince have always strenuously denied that he was aware of any link between donations to his charity and honours.After the allegations emerged Mr Fawcett temporarily stepped down from his role pending a full investigation by the Prince’s Foundation. The charity regulator in Scotland launched its own investigation.A friend told the Daily Mail that accusations that he played a part in a “cash for honours” scandal had had a devastating effect.They told the paper: Michael has resigned and he will never be coming back. He has lost five stone in weight and is a shadow of his former self.A spokesman for The Prince’s Foundation said: “Michael Fawcett has resigned from his post as CEO of The Prince’s Foundation.”Clarence House confirmed it had severed its relationship with both Mr Fawcett and his events company.A Clarence House spokesman said: “Michael Fawcett and Premier Mode will not be providing services to us in future.

Ministers pledged in February to “address the historic wrong” against brave gay personnel, who were not allowed to serve until a rule change in . Yet despite estimates  to  LGBT personnel were discharged every year, just six have applied to have their medals restored - and only two completed the process as of this week.That is despite the Sunday Mirror revealing some received a letter inviting them to claim medals back by Remembrance Sunday. Shadow Armed Forces Minister Stephen Morgan accused the government of falling short. He said: “Ministers must move much further and faster towards justice for those who were thrown out of our armed forces simply because of their sexuality.  “Warm words mean little to a community who have been treated so poorly despite their service to our country.” Caroline Paige, Joint Chief Executive Officer of Fighting with Pride, said: “The Government must raise its game and find an honourable future for those impacted by the ban”. Five veterans who were discharged for reasons related to their sexuality, and forfeited medals as a result, have applied up to November . One of those has had their medals restored. A further veteran who voluntarily surrendered their medals after being dismissed has got them back. The Ministry of Defence urged more veterans to come forward, eventhey have personal reasons for not having applied yet. MOD minister Leo Docherty said: “It is deeply regrettable that, because of their sexuality, some members of the Armed Forces were, in the past, treated in a way that would not be acceptable today.” An MOD spokesperson said: “We remain in contact with applicants and continue to encourage any LGBT veterans who may have been affected by this issue to submit an application for their case to be considered.” Comment MORE ON British ArmyMinistry of DefenceRemembrance DayArmed forcesPublic servicesSexuality\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An analysis of Electoral Commission records shows donations stretching back to  linking the party with oil and gas magnates.It comes as consumers are braced for massive hikes in their energy bills and as the PM attempts to lead efforts for the world to tackle climate change at the COP summit, while facing a flurry of sleaze claims levelled at his MPs since the resignation of Owen Paterson. Have your say on these donations in the comment section Anneliese Dodds, chairwoman of the Labour Party, told the Mirror: “Boris Johnson needs to show some leadership and put an end to the sleaze running rampant through his party and the cash-for-access culture at the heart of his Government.“Conservative MPs pocketing millions from vested interests can’t be acting in the national interest. It’s not a good look for the Prime Minister to claim commitment on moving past fossil fuels, but at the same time his own party is swimming in oil and gas money.“We need a Government that puts people and planet first, not one that thinks there’s one rule for the Conservative Party and another for everyone .”Donors to the Tories include Alexander Temerko, the Russian-born owner of Aquind. The energy boss and his company handed ious MPs, including former Cabinet ministers Liam Fox and Jeremy Hunt, and the current Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke, and the party, more than £,.Aquind plans to build a £.billion energy pipeline under the English Channel and Mr Temerko was spotted sitting with COP President Alok Sharma at this year’s exclusive Black and White Ball, a fundraiser for the Conservative Party.Ian Taylor, the former chief executive of Vitol, who reportedly turned down a knighthood offered by former PM David Cameron, has also handed the party some £, since . The company he led until  is a major trader and supplier of North Sea crude oil. Weeks before the general election in , Mercantile  Maritime gave the party some £,. The commodities trading firm was founded by oil broker and billionaire Murtaza Lakhani. Matthew Ferrey, part of an elite group of Tory donors and a former executive with oil trader Vitol, has given the party £,. It includes £, to an inidual MP, the former minister and “ Brexit hardman” Steve Baker.The Wycombe MP told an event at Tory Party conference in  that while “the science is absolutely settled” on climate change, students should be taught they will get “poorer”, “colder”, and eat “insects for protein” as a result of climate policies.  Mr Baker declined to comment. The party’s former treasurer, Mick Davis, a South African-born former executive of mining company Xstrata also handed the party around £,.  In January, he set up a firm targeting “troubled mining assets” as well as joining the board of a “coal start-up”. A Tory source insisted the Conservatives were leading the climate change debate and alleged that claims to the contrary were “misguided”. He said: “No other party in government has done more than the Conservatives to reduce Britain’s dependency on dirty fossil fuels. “While Labour did next to nothing in government, we put net zero by  into law, banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by , and our Net Zero Strategy sets out a clear plan to decarbonise every part of our economy to eradicate the UK’s contribution to climate change. Any suggestion this Government is somehow not committed to tackling climate change is hilariously misguided.” The Mirror approached the MPs for comment about the donations, which were registered and are not subject to a standards investigation. Calls are intensying for a crackdown on MPs having second jobs after Sir Geoffrey Cox made some £m working as a barrister and adviser. Despite barely being in Parliament over the last year, Sir Geoffrey has said he will not stand down. Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson was found to have repeatedly lobbied MPs and ministers on behalf of two companies, who together were paying him £,.

Tallies by theand the Daily Mail suggest the barrister made between £.m and £m from his private jobs since .Chancellor Rishi Sunak admitted the government “need to do better” after a failed bid to rip up the standards process for MPs last week. The revelations added fuel to criticism of Boris Johnson for presiding over the botched move - which sparked a wave of sleaze rows.They also add to criticism of the former Attorney General, elected in , over the huge extent of his outside work.Sir Geoffrey has spent  hours a week on private work in the last year, but only spoken in the Commons once in that time.And the QC missed Commons votes this week because he was on a business trip to Mauritius. Meanwhile he may face a standards probe over claims he joined a legal hearing from his Commons office. He denies wrongdoing. Senior ministers today refused to defend Sir Geoffrey - after Boris Johnson said MPs must put their job in Parliament first. Chancellor Rishi Sunak refused to comment on the specic case but admitted “we need to do better” on standards. Referring to Boris Johnson trying to tear up the system to save Owen Paterson over multiple breaches of lobbying rules, Mr Sunak said: “On the broader point - and just reflecting over recent events. “I think for us as a Government, itaposs fair to say that we need to do better than we did last week, and we know that.

Askedhe could see that the optics were not good in the second jobs debate, Mr Scully replied: Absolutely, I can see how it looks. It is really regrettable that weaposve got to this situation.  Pressed on what was regrettable about the situation, he added: That weaposve got in a position that, first of all, last week we allowed the situation for one inidualto be conflated with the standards procedures, which do need looking at, they do need an appeals process, but in order to do that we need a cross-party consensus. Then, as I say, for a number of other issues to be conflated which we need to tackle, but we need to tackle in a level-headed way and certainly not to get into a party political bun fight. One furious Tory backbencher told the Mirror: “I’m incredibly unimpressed and a lot of the  intake also are. “Would people want action  For sure. Because they work damn hard for their constituents and they don’t want to be tarred by these people who’ve been around for ever and seem to have a dferent set of standards and priorities.” Sir Geoffrey has said he does not believe he has breached parliamentary rules and will co-operate with any investigation. But he has claimed he had authorisation from the Tory Chief Whip to do work in the British Virgin Islands while Parliament was sitting.  In total he has taken part in hearings in the BVI’s corruption inquiry on  separate days this year when the Commons was sitting. Sir Geoffrey’s office issued a defiant statement saying he “regularly works -hour weeks” and constituency work is “given primary importance”. It went on: “Sir Geoffrey’s view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practices that profession. “That has been the consistent view of the local Conservative Association and although at every election his political opponents have sought to make a prominent issue of his professional practice, it has so far been the consistent view of the voters of Torridge and West Devon. “Sir Geoffrey is very content to abide by their decision.” But one unnamed constituent told PA: “I sent an email to Geoffrey Cox which I waited over  days for a response to.

Literally. The Right Honourable Member for Skipton and Ripon earns almost as much as the Prime Minister – from his second jobs.He built up an impressive business portfolio after Boris Johnson sacked him as Northern Ireland Secretary.The House of Commons Register of Members’ Interests shows successful Smith has three places of work outside Westminster. He earns £, a year, plus VAT, as an external adviser on business development to Ryse Hydrogen of London, paid monthly, for  hours a year.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section He also trousers £, a year, plus VAT, from MJM Marine of Newry in his old Ulster bailiwick, also paid monthly, for a more onerous - hours a year. From Simply Blue Management of Newquay, he picks up another £, per month plus VAT as an adviser, and is expected to put in - hours a month. This bumper pay packet totals £, a year for what could be less than eight days’ work, some of it at £, an hour. Yet his government baulks at a £ an hour National Minimum Wage, and tells workers on Universal Credit “work two more hours” to recoup their £ benefit cut. Of course, all this lovely moolah on top of his £, a year parliamentary salaryis approved by the authorities. It is perfectly legal and above board. All I can I say is: some authority, some law, some board. Smith must have business skills not readily apparent when he was a minister. As Theresa May’s chief whip, he broke the parliamentary rules on “pairing” and lost countless votes. He couldn’t whip a top. And he lasted less than seven months in Belfast. Quite what his second-jobbery does for the , people of his largely rural constituency escapes me. Frankly, I wouldn’t pay jammy Julian in washers, but he’s not alone in cashing in on the cachet of being an MP. Dozens of them are at it. There is pressure to end the privilege. Mirror readers are in no doubt, voting % to scrap the system.  The name above Julian Smith in the Register is Jeff Smith, Labour MP for Manchester Withington. He lists his outside interests as “Nil”.

Labour MP for Walthamstow, Stella Creasy, attempted to board a London bus with her baby on Tuesday, but was refused boarding by the driver. Ms Creasy posted a photo on Twitter showing the inside of the bus she was attempting to board.While two pushchairs can be seen in the space allocated to pushchairs and wheelchairs on the bus, the rest of the bus appears half empty, with plenty of space for another pushchair.Based on the photo MP Creasy posted, MyLondon was able to geolocate where the alleged incident took place in Chingford Mount, north east London. Tagging London’s Deputy Mayor of London for Transport, Heidi Alexander, as well as London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Ms Creasy said: “Well that wasn’t fun. “Just been kicked off an empty bus by a bus driver because there were two pushchairs already on it. “Surely when the bus is this empty andlarge amount of space as you can see it can’t be TfL policy to do this !” Her tweet triggered a wave of supportive comments from mothers who have also encountered the same problem. “I had the same problem  years ago. I had hoped that times might have moved on,” said one. Another said: “Same thing happened to me  years ago. Ridiculous rules. Passengers with babies kids in pushchairs should be prioritised alongside iniduals in wheelchairs and buses should be remodelled to be able to take more of these passengers”. One user also commented saying London Mayor Sadiq Khan “might remind drivers that it is illegal to stop or refuse to allow the transit or transport” of an MP who might be on route to Parliament. Former Liberal Democrat councillor Stephen Fenwick weighed in saying: “Surely you couldaposve used the old ‘do you know who I am ’ trick to get on board   I used it many times a few years ago when I was a cllr and got my way.” But MP Creasy replied, saying: “Would oddly enough never do that but struggling with two children, one extremely poorly, and being shouted at for just getting on a bus is not great. Also it seems bizarrea bus is not full to demand someone get off - that’s why I want to knowit’s TfL policy !” Guidelines on using pushchairson Transport for London buses can be found on the TfL website. “Drivers should make sure passengers have time to position their buggy safely, and hold on or sit down before moving away,” the TfL website says, asking passengers to “fold the buggy upitaposs too wide to fit through the doors and down the aisle”. The website says: “If youaposre using a double buggy, feel free to get on the bus at the back exit doors, but remember to check with the driver first. “For safety reasons and general passenger comfort, move your buggy out of the middle aisle. “All buses have a wheelchair space available. By law, wheelchair users have priority over the space as it is the only place they can travel safely. When a wheelchair user is not using the space, you can use it on a first come first served basis. “If a wheelchair user wishes to board a bus, you should share the space, fold your buggy or move. You will not be asked to leave the bus, but you may choose to do so. “If you wish to board the next bus instead, the driver will issue you a transfer ticket so you donapost need to pay a double fare”.

It is good to see it thriving again after a tough year,” the post read. But eagle-eyed residents spotted a Christmas tree in the background, and pointed out the townaposs festive decorations had not been put up yet. It later transpired that the same image was uploaded by the MP on two other occasions, on  December last year and  September this year, when the MP participated in several parliamentary votes.  The -year-old has insisted he was in fact in Thorne, near Doncaster, on November  – but says he forgot to take a photo before leaving. The MP has since claimed he forgot to take a photo during his trip and says it is not the first time he has re-used pictures when visiting parts of his constituency. He said: Having spent the afternoon walking round Thorne with a local business man and calling at a local café for a coffee, I forgot to take a photo. This is not the first time I have reused a photo when forgetting to take one and I am sure it will not be the last. Following anger from constituents at the apparently fake November  post, he updated it, writing: Apologies, forgot to take a photo on my walk about. Will make sure I take one when I’m back again next week. Look forward to seeing you all soon. He also tweeted: It has been widely reported that yesterday, I reused an old photo of me visiting Thorne. While I did in fact attend a surgery there, it was a mistake for me to reuse a picture. So, on my next visit, I’ll make sure to take a new photo to promote this great town in #DonValley!

Natalie Elphicke earns around £ an hour in her work outside Parliament as the chair of the New Homes Quality Board. She was handed a one-off £, in November , and since January has been paid just under £ per week for eight hours’ work, on top of her £k job as an MP. The organisation exists to “promote a new code for housebuilding standards” and Ms Elphicke has spent around  hours on the job since she was appointed in May . Ms Elphicke is one of scores of MPs with work outside Parliament, a practice ministers insist brings a “richness” to Parliamentary experience. But she is now in the spotlight because of comments she made about Marcus Rashford, for which she apologised in July.  England suffered heartbreak in the Euro  final after a - penalty shootout loss handed victory to Italy. And Ms Elphicke hit headlines after questioning Rashfordaposs commitment to the game when he missed a penalty. She wrote to Tory MPs: Would it be ungenerous to say Rashford should have spent more time perfecting his game and less time playing politics. Rashford, who was awarded an MBE for his campaigning for vulnerable children, forced the Government into embarrassing U-turns on free school meals and has raised more than £m for charity. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner blasted Ms Elphicke for sneering at the inspirational player at the time. Tory MP Simon Hoare said: Would it be ungenerous  Yes. Unwarranted  Yes. Wrong  Yes. Downing Street also slapped down the MP, saying she had rightly apologised. Ms Elphicke said at the time: I regret messaging privately a rash reaction about Marcus Rashfordaposs missed penalty and apologise to him for any suggestion that he is not fully focussed on his football. Ms Rayner said last night: “Marcus Rashford is the pride of Manchester and he doesn’t need the permission of anyone to do the wonderful work that he does.“ Boris Johnson needs to decide whether his MPs are MPs representing their constituents orthey are advisers and consultants working for private interests who pay them. They can’t be both.“It’s time for the Prime Minister to come out of hiding.

Mr Abbott, who lives in the lands of the iconic London landmark with  other Yeoman Warders and their families, said it would likely raise a few eyebrowsa For Sale sign appeared outside his two-bed flat. He tweeted: “Thanks for the very kind offer Foxtons to sell or rent out the th century property that HM Tower of London provide me with, however, I think it may raise a few eyebrows when your sign appears outside my house.  The letter - believed to be from the Wapping branch of the agents - said we are valuing property in your area next week before offering to give a no strings attached professional opinion of the sales or rental value of your property in the current market. The Beefeaters are the oldest military corp and existing military corp royal bodyguards in the country. They consist of ex-military members who have served at least  years and hold the Long Service and Good Conduct medal.

Mr Abbott served for  years in the RAF, before joining the Tower six year ago.

But they were never seen again, sparking rumours they had been smothered in their beds and in  the skeletons of two young boys matching the ages of the lost princes were found under a staircase in the White Tower. And the courtyard of the Tower served as the stage where Anne Boleyn was beheaded at the request of her husband King Henry VIII. The Tower and its grounds are said to be haunted by the ghost of the former Queen, whose headless ghost has been spotted leading a procession of knights of ladies towards the scene of her death. Guy Fawkes was famously tortured to death at the Tower, and his screams are said to be heard through the walls - which could draw some complaints from any new neighbours.

The condition is also known as childhood dementia and causes kids to have a shortened le expectancyIsaac Tilley in hospital Image: Caters NewsByCally BrooksChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov | commentsA five-year-old boy has been diagnosed with rare childhood dementia, with his devastated family now raising awareness of the condition. Little Isaac Tilley suffered from a range of symptoms including seizures, loss of mobility, and delayed speech for two years. His mum Aimee Tilley, , was devastated when he was diagnosed with CLN Batten disease in August. The rare condition is also known as childhood dementia and causes kids to have a shortened le expectancy. Isaacaposs mum, his dad Adrian, , and sister Eva, eight, have been warned he may not reach his teenage years, even though his treatment is designed to slow down the progression of the disease. Isaac lost the ability to play football, run and even walk in just eight months, his mum said.  Aimee, who is now Isaacaposs full-time carer, said: When he was three, he had his first seizure and  days later after another seizure, he was diagnosed with epilepsy. He was also suffering from speech delay and at one point, I thought he may have autism. His private speech therapist had noticed something wasnapost right which encouraged me to ask for Isaac to be referred to a neurologist in Oxford. It wasnapost until January this year that I noticed his hands and legs would shake and he was unsteady on his feet, this got worse over the next few months and his speech still wasnapost coming along either. He had an MRI, heart tests, blood tests, and a lumbar puncture in February but it wasnapost until August, after receiving results from an Epilepsy Panel test, taken the previous November at our local hospital, that we were given the devastating diagnosis of CLN Batten disease.  The mum added: We had never heard of Batten disease and were given an out-of-date leaflet and told he wouldnapost make it to see his teenage years. Itaposs classed as a form of childhood dementia as children progressively lose all their skills and eventually die. Isaac has lost the ability to run, play football, ride his bike and scooter, and even walk without support in just eight months. Itaposs heartbreaking to watch. In his head he still wants to do these things but physically he canapost. Before this, Isaac was so athletic so the only warning sign we had was his delayed speech in the beginning but that can be put down to a lot of other things. I was told, boys are lazy, heaposll catch up, which was so frustrating. I want more parents to know about Batten Disease and to be aware of early symptoms becauseit had been diagnosed sooner, Isaac would be having a much greater quality of le than he does currently. The sooner children start treatment, the better. According to the Batten Disease Family Association, only four children are diagnosed with the juvenile form of Batten disease every year, making it rare and dficult to treat.  Aimee added: Iaposm so desperate to raise awareness because there isnapost enough known about it and Iaposve found myself explaining to doctors and other health professionals what Batten disease is. Everyone needs to be aware of this vile disease, it may be rare but it can affect anyone. When he was having seizures, he didnapost fit into a particular group for epilepsy which should have been our first warning sign but this wasnapost investigated. Isaac is currently on enzyme replacement therapy, given via brain infusions every two weeks at Great Ormond Street, which is currently funded by NHSE but in , it could be taken away as itaposs costing £, per child per year. I understand itaposs expensive but it works and children are thriving on it! We are still so early into treatment that we are still seeing Isaac decline but I believe like the other children he will gain back some of his lost skills. We were told to expect decline for up to  months and then he should plateau for a while.  His speech has declined even more, he drools now, he still has seizures now and then, he canapost stand still, heaposs lost a lot of core strength, he doesnapost like to walk unsupported because heaposs lost his confidence since falling so much and his mobility is continually declining. No mother should have to watch their child go through this. Eventually without treatment, they would expect Isaac to go blind and his body will shut down. Batten disease is an inherited condition, only passed downboth parents have the gene. Thankfully, Isaacaposs sister Eva does not have the condition. The family have no idea how long they have with Isaac and are trying to make as many memories as possible. Aimee said: The treatment isnapost a cure, itaposll slow down the progression but we donapost know how long for. I want people to know the signs and encourage parents to push for answerssomething doesnapost seem right. We recently went to Thomas Land and are going to Lapland UK in December. Iaposm desperate to make as many fun memories for us all while we can. Especially whilst Isaac still has his sight. Making memories together is the most important thing to me now and we have to put a brave face on every day. I live in hope every day a cure will be found to save Isaac and all the other little warriors like him. I just want to raise awareness for this condition and encourage other parents to look into it and do their research. I live with regret every day I didnapost do more. The family is currently fundraising for adaptations needed for their home, equipment and making memories with Isaac.To donate, click here.Comment MORE ON Great Ormond Street HospitalHospitalsLe expectancyMental healthTherapyDementiaEpilepsyAsperger’s syndromeChildrens Hospital\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rafal Murawski, , bought the fruit from the branch at the Peel Centre in Bracknell, Berkshire on the morning of Thursday, October , and was shocked to find a nest on the outside. Rafal said his young son couldnapost even sleep because of the idea of the spiders being in the house, adding that he was appalled by the reaction of the staff in Morrisons when he brought the bananas back. Thankfully, none of the spider eggs hatched, but Rafal fears they were likely to the worldaposs deadliest arachnid - the Brazilian wandering spider. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here However, Morrisons has said it is unlikely the eggs are from the deadly spider, as the bananas are from Ecuador, where there are not as many venomous species. Mr Murawski said: It was shocking really. I bought the bananas and saw there was this horrible spideraposs nest on there. I hate spiders, so I was quite worried. I knew the bananas had come from Ecuador, so I did some research and read a few articles. I think itaposs very likely these are the eggs of a Brazilian wandering spider. They can be very venomous so obviously it was a worry for me. Mr Murawski, who describes himself as an arachnophobic, said his seven-year-old son has not been able to sleep since they found the nest. And the dad was left surprised by the reaction of staff when he ed the bananas, as he claims the store manager just laughed when I told her. She even offered me another bunch from the same batch, he said.  I was very surprised. Iaposve read in other places stores were closed because of discoveries like these, but there didnapost seem to be any process here at all. A Morrisons spokesperson said: Weaposre sorry that the customer was worried, but we can confirm our bananas are not sourced from Brazil. She said the company works with selected farms in South America to ensure high-quality agricultural practices are maintained. There are five checkpoints for quality before the bananas make it to the supermarket, including checks for insects and spiders before the fruit is packed.  There are also several inspections when they arrive in the UK. The Brazilian wandering spider gets its name from roaming around the jungle floor in South America at night, looking for prey. The Guinness Book of Records says itaposs the most toxic spider in the world, but there have been few deaths from its bite. It only injects venom in a third of its bites and statistics showed out of , cases, just  people died. However, it can still be extremely painful, and cause an unwanted erection in men which lasts for four hours.

The -year-old had just missed hopping aboard the last service from Beverley Bus Station to Dunswell in East Yorkshire.She pleaded with the bus driver to let her on the vehicle so she could get home, but he refused, Hull Daily Mail reported. Fortunately a police officer witnessed the encounter and came over to see what was going on. The girlaposs dad, Gary Hockney, said: She was so upset. It happened on Sunday night and on Monday she didnapost go to college. She was frightened to go on the bus because she goes on a public bus and she was worried that she would bump into this driver.  She came back on Monday and she was in tears about it and explained that was why. The teenager tried to board the East Yorkshire Bus service at .pm on Sunday, November , after visiting her friends. She claims that as she reached the bus it began to pull away. The girl stood in front of the bus while it was still in the parking bay so she was visible to the driver. But, she claims he refused to let her on and instead continually beeped the horn, flashed his lights and revved the engine while she was in tears. Can you just open the door, I need to get home, she can be heard saying in a video.  A police officer believed to have been dealing with another incident at the station came over after witnessing the incident unfold and spoke with the bus driver, who said that he could not open the doors due to health and safety reasons. Speaking about the incident, Mr Hockney said: In her words, which isnapost wrong going by the footage, the bus was still in the parking bay and as she approached it, it began to pull away. She was directly in front of the doors and in full view of the driver. He looked at her, he saw her and carried on pulling out. She started crying at one point and heaposs revving his engine, flashing his lights, beeping his horn and then fortunately a police officer in the station at the time came over and asked what was going on. If you look at the footage, she challenged the driver and he just referred to this blunt health and safety policy.  Fortunately for the girl, the police officer gave her a lt back home. Mr Hockney said: I want to draw attention to his actions but also the officers, because itaposs such a positive thing that she did, I would have picked her up but it was such a nice gesture. Having thought about it might be that the bus company doesnapost allow that sort of discretion, which is stupid. They should give their employees the confidence to make those decisions. Iaposm sure he would have let his own daughter on in that situation orhe saw somebody being chased or something surely at some point thereaposs a cut off and you show some discretion. A spokesperson for East Yorkshire Buses said: On Sunday night one of our buses was in the process of leaving Beverley Bus Station at its scheduled departure time when a late arriving passenger ran out in front of it to try to stop it leaving. For safety reasons, our drivers are advised not to allow any more passengers to board once they have closed the doors and reversed off the bus station stands, as it is unsafe for passengers to try to enter the part of the station where buses are moving. The passenger refused to move from in front of the bus, so a police officer who was in the station dealing with some antisocial behaviour came to speak to the driver, and agreed to give the passenger a lt home so that the bus could continue on its way. Our driver was satisfied that the passenger was safe, and the bus was able to continue with its journey.We’d advise that passengers always ensure they arrive at their bus stop in good time, and we have live tracking features on our website and app which you can use to ensure you never miss a bus.” Comment MORE ON Teenagers\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Many of us try to be organised and establish a plan, others can’t even bear to think about the costs. Funeral specialists, Distinct Cremations, has quizzed Brits to find out their thoughts and opinions on death and burials. It found that  per cent of us don’t have a funeral plan in place yet, with the most popular funeral type being an ‘upbeat celebration of le.’ Perhaps the most staggering statistic is the fact that Gen-Z may be more funeral prepared as opposed to the older generation. The figures show that those aged  to  are the ones who are most likely to have a plan in place for their funeral. . per cent of --year-olds say they have a plan, which is almost double the amount of people within the age bracket of - at . per cent. In fact, those between the ages  and  were the least likely to have considered funeral arrangements. Ages + were less likely to plan their own funerals at . per cent, as opposed to  to  year olds at over  per cent. The figures also showed that less than half of us have savings for emergencies, and would not be able to pay for the funeral of a loved one.  per cent of those who said they couldn’t afford to pay for the funeral of a loved one would need to resort to borrowing the money either from a friend or family member or by taking out a loan.  Some even suggested resorting to a crowdfunding site, with  per cent believing this would be the only option. Others considered selling items to raise money. Steve Wallis, managing director of Distinct Cremations, said: “It’s staggering to think that so many do not have savings in place for an emergency. “The death of a loved one is hard enough, without financial pressure adding to the grief. The fact that so many believe it is their responsibility, yet four in ten said they have no savings in place for such emergencies, really highlights the disparity between the present and future.” Figures show that  per cent of us would have to get an emergency payday loan to pay for the funeral, while  per cent believe the deceased person’s estate would cover the cost. But why is Gen-Z so prepared  Well, it could be because over a third of UK adults said that the Covid- pandemic has made them think dferently about funerals. –-year-olds are the most likely to have had their perceptions of funerals changed as a result of the pandemic and over a fthof those aged + also agreed. Wallis concluded: “There’s no doubt that the last  months brought funerals to the forefront of our minds, with many of us unable to have the big funerals that were planned, or indeed faced with planning a funeral out of the blue. “As such, no longer are many people wanting to follow traditions and have big funerals with services afterwards. Instead, people are realising they can have a simple funeral for a fraction of the cost, minimising the impact this has on their friends and family.” For funeral notices in your area visit funeral-notices Comment MORE ON FuneralsFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yesterday the Government confirmed it will be mandatory for frontline NHS workers to have the Covid vaccine.With the exception of those with a medical reason not to, everyone must have had two jabs, most likely by April. Reluctantly I think it is the right call. No one should be made to do anything they don’t want to do. Butpeople don’t want the vaccination then they shouldn’t be in jobs that involve looking after some of the sickest and most vulnerable people in our society. Mandatory jabs are nothing new. Healthcare staff doing certain procedures need to have had the hepatitis B vaccine.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Some argue that’s dferent as people who went into the profession knew they had to have the jab beforehand, so were able to make their own choices, while this is something retrospective. But we are where we are. It’s nothing short of a miracle that we have vaccines to protect us from a virus that has already claimed the lives of , people in Britain alone. I believe in the Covid vaccines. I’m double jabbed. I certainly wouldn’t ask someone to do something I wouldn’t be prepared to do myself.  But I also have an  year old grandmother with a lung condition – she needs a machine at night to help with her breathing. Would I be happy for an unvaccinated health worker to look after her  From a totally selfish point of view I wouldn’t. I want the safest pairs of hands possible giving her care. The NHS, scientists and our political leaders need to do a much better job of explaining that the vaccines are safe and have been tested on people across the world. I feel desperately sorry for anyone who feels they will have to leave the profession over this – there are already , unfilled positions in the NHS in England. They certainly shouldn’t be hounded out of the profession. Maybe they can be found jobs where they don’t come into contact with vulnerable people. I hope before April’s deadline more workers are convinced about the efficacy of the vaccines and roll up their sleeves to have the jab. It would be a shame to lose dedicated workers when we need them more than ever.

The suspect was caught on camera passing the Hendersons’ front garden with a drink can in his hand. Seconds later the plastic turf was rolled up and taken away. Daughter Courtney, , said: “My mum opened the curtains and was like: ‘Where’s the grass gone ’ “She was really confused at first and rang my dad askinghe knew why someone had taken the grass.” She added: “It’s really bizarre because it’s like the smallest piece of grass ever.” A neighbour’s CCTV captured the moment the turf was lted at pm on Sunday as the family sat in their lounge in Heywood, Gtr Manchester, last Sunday. Courtney said: “It was at around pm, like an hour after my dad got in. I was literally on the couch at the time. “I don’t think it could be someone trying to sell it for money because it’s the tiniest thing ever, it must only be worth around £ at the most.”  The beauty business owner said the thief had a distinct walk and was wearing a bucket hat. She added: “I just don’t get how no one has seen a man walking down the street with a roll of grass. “He’s got a distinct walk and he’s wearing a bucket hat. Surely someone knows this guy as there can’t be that many people walking around Heywood with a can and a bucket hat.” Comment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jason Knauf is said to have repeatedly refused to help the Mail on Sunday in its bitter legal battle with the Duchess of Sussex saying he wanted to stay “neutral”.But court papers allege the -year-old performed a dramatic U-turn in the aftermath of three major royal crises, The Sun reports.The first was in February when Meghan won her High Court case against the publication over a leaked letter she sent to her -year-old estranged dad Thomas.  Meghan penned the emotional letter in  and parts of it were then reproduced in the Mail on Sunday the next year. The -year-old claimed it misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act and won the case. In March, Buckingham Palace said it had launched an official investigation following a complaint by Mr Knauf that Meghan had bullied three members of household staff.The announcement came just days before the bombshell two-hour interview with Meghan , Harry and the US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey was aired.The couple made a number of explosive royal claims including alleging that a senior royal asked how “dark” Harry and Meghan’s son Archie would be when he was born.Meghan, an ex-actress, also claimed that royal le had left her on the verge of suicide.  At the time of the interview being aired Mr Knaufwas being represented by lawyers acting for three other royal aides dubbed the “Palace Four”.On April , they said Mr Knauf still wished to stay “strictly neutral” despite repeated approaches from the Mail on Sundayaposs parent company, Associated Newspapers. A month later Mr Knauf announced he was stepping down as Meghanaposs communication secretary before a “confidential source” approached the Mail on Sunday to tell them he had undergone a dramatic change of heart. During the third and final day of the hearing on Thursday, further documents were released which revealed that a confidential source contacted the publisher with the information that Mr Knauf, who is due to stand down from his current role as the chief executive officerof the Royal Foundation at the end of the year, regretted not giving evidence during the High Court proceedings. In a witness statement, Keith Mathieson, solicitor for ANL, said he believed Mr Knauf’s evidence was “honest and credible”.  Mr Mathieson said that, in April, Mr Knauf’s then legal team contacted ANL’s lawyers to say he did not wish to have any involvement in the proceedings and that his position was “strictly neutral”. However, following the judgment in Meghan’s favour, ANL was contacted by the source in July and approached Mr Knauf, who by then wished to provide a statement for the appeal. He added: “Mr Knauf was plainly a central figure in the events he describes. “He was a senior and trusted member of the royal household staff and he continues to occupy an important position as CEO of The Royal Foundation. “His witness statement is measured in tone and he has been careful not to include evidence of matters beyond his own personal knowledge. “Given the high profile nature of this litigation and the likelihood of his evidencebeing widely reported, as well as the position he holds, it is hardly conceivable that he would say anything he did not believe to be true and I know of nothing in his evidence which is subject to any reasonable challenge. Mr Knauf was communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry from February  to May . After Harry and Meghan’s wedding he became communications secretary to both couples until March . Later that year he became CEO of the Cambridges’ Royal Foundation charity, a position he will step down from next month.

Thomas has been critical about Meghan and Harry and once again fired an attack at them in an interview where he criticised the Duke of Sussex before the  royal wedding. He claims he invited Meghan and Harry to his home in Mexico several times but they never took him up on his offer.  Thomas told GB News: “I’m very disappointed that Harry, wanting to marry my daughter, wouldn’t have had the good sense to come down here and ask for her hand. Someone who is royalty I would think would want to go by the book and do things properly but apparently it didn’t matter to him so that was a disappointment as well.” Thomas said he wanted to play a role in the lives of Meghan and Harry and his two grandchildren. “I certainly always want my family especially now the older I get the more I need my family, he said.  The father and daughter have reportedly not been on speaking terms since Thomas staged a photo shoot for press before his daughter got married to Harry in . He did not attend the wedding after having a heart attack and needing surgery. Mr Markle last appeared on British TV screens at the end of October when he was interviewed on Good Morning Britain. During the attack on the Sussexes, Thomas claimed he was being ghosted by Meghan and has vowed to continue to publicly attack his daughter until she begins speaking to him again. I think Harry has abandoned the Queen, the royal family, the British people and the Army. Heaposs abandoned them all, he said on GMB.

And although it was the Carolina Herrera dress that proved to be the showstopper, she also wore a beautul £, bracelet that once belonged to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana. The diamond tennis bracelet by Cartier has been sported by Meghan on numerous occasions, including during her tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey in March. But itaposs not the only time that she worn pieces once owned by her husbandaposs mum - here we look at some of the beautul jewellery Meghan has worn in tribute to Diana... Diamond bracelet Princess Diana wore her Cartier diamond tennis bracelet several times before her tragic death in . And since Meghan married Harry, she has sported the bracelet, thought to be worth £, numerous times. The first was during a state dinner in Fiji in  and to observe Commonwealth Day in . Meghan also chose to wear the piece during her bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey and it got its latest outing this week at the Intrepid Valor Awards in New York City. Cartier watch Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.Princess Diana regularly wore a gold Cartier Tank Française watch for engagements in the s.The watch gted to her by her father on her st birthday, was believed to have been given to Meghan by her now-husband Harry in the early days of their relationship. Meghan recently wore the watch in a YouTube video while reading her childrenaposs book The Bench and in a beautul picture taken of her and Harry for Time magazine in .However, it seems that the watch didnapost always belong to Harry.When Diana died, her private jewellery was ided up between her sons, and itaposs thought Prince William was given the watch, while Harry got her engagement ring - before they eventually swapped. In Amazon Prime show The Diana Story, the princessaposs former butler Paul Burrell explained that shortly before William proposed to his now-we the Duchess of Cambridge in , Harry offered his brother the chance to give his bride-to-be their motheraposs ring. Aquamarine ringOne of the first times Meghan wore jewellery once owned by the late Diana was on her wedding day. She sported an Emerald cut aquamarine ring, surrounded by small solitaire diamonds and set in -carat yellow gold, on her right hand at her evening reception.Diana had been previously pictured wearing the item, which was created by Asprey in , the same year she died following a Paris car crash. Butterfly earrings and gold bangle Shortly after their wedding, Meghan and Harry headed on a royal tour of Australia - and it coincided with the news they were expecting their first child Archie.And one their first engagements of the tour, Meghan wore a pair of stunning butterfly earrings and a gold bracelet that once belonged to Diana.The pieces were thought to be a gt from Harry to mark their happy baby news. At the time, Meghan gave onlookers a glimpse of the beautul jewel-encrusted butterfly earrings as she pushed her hair behind her ears, while the stunning bracelet, which features two blue stones, was on clear view. She has since worn the two pieces together since that day - at the launch of her clothing collection for charity SmartWorks. Engagement ring  Princess Dianaaposs engagement ring is now famously worn by Meghanaposs sister-in-law Kate.But Meghanaposs engagement ring still pays a beautul tribute to Diana in a dferent way.Thataposs because it features two diamonds from Dianaaposs collection and another from Botswana, where Harry does a lot of charity work. Harry designed Meghanaposs ring himself and spoke proudly about the piece during their engagement interview. He said: The ring is obviously yellow gold because thataposs her favourite and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana, and the little diamonds either side are from my motheraposs jewellery collection, to make sure that sheaposs with us on this crazy journey together.

But she never imagined the mischievous three-year-old pooch would have craving for her underwear too - ing into the washing basket and grabbing out her cotton thong. Full-time carer Helen,  and partner David Ferry, , were then forced to chase energetic dog around the living room but stood defeated as he swallowed the pants whole. The panicked pair then rushed him to the emergency vets and were hit with a £ bill - while the sheepish pooch quietly sulked in the back of their car. Hilarious pictures show Charlie Bear wearing his bandana with the slogan aposknicker snatcherapos alongside a sign saying aposI ate mamaposs knickers and it cost her £ to get them backapos. Helen, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, said: Charlieaposs really cheeky. He pinched my knickers out the laundry basket at night. It was a black cotton thong. He had them in his mouth and we chased him, which we shouldnapost have really. My partner had hold of them in his mouth but he wouldnapost give them up and he swallowed them whole. My partner couldnapost get them out. When he had it in his mouth, I knew it was another trip to the vets. Weaposve been before because he swallowed trainer socks. I called the emergency vets straight away. I said aposmy dog swallowed my knickersapos. It cost £. It was £ before we even left the house because it was after hours. Heaposs got expensive taste. Helen was forced to rush Charlie Bear for emergency treatment, which involved him being injected to induce vomiting. In a humiliating exchange, she was forced to discuss her underwear with staff at the vets - admitting she was thankful they werenapost aposbig belly warmersapos. Helen said: He struggled to swallow them but made sure he got them down, then he was fine. He wasnapost struggling to breathe or anything. We got to the vet and we had to ring them to say we were outside in the car park. The vet came out and we handed him over. They asked what time he swallowed them, what kind of knickers they were to make sure they werenapost big belly warmers. I was telling a total stranger about my knickers. I handed him over then they gave him an injection to make him sick. If you get there quick enough, they induce vomiting and the thong came straight up. The nurse then came out to say heaposd brought them up and my partner asked for them back. He was only joking and I said aposno, chuck them in the binapos. Charlie was a bit sheepish on the way home and a bit lethargic - quite quiet. We now have to keep the knickers in the wash basket upstairs and not the one downstairs. We already keep shoes and socks up high away from him because heaposs murder for them. If itaposs on the floor, itaposs his. As the crafty pup now enjoys quite the following online, he regularly models dog bandanas and has a custom-made slogan neckerchief with the phrase aposknicker snatcherapos on it. Helen said: Itaposs funny now. We were laughing the next day about it but at the time it was a bit of a shock. He wears bandanas every day and models for a lady that makes dog bandanas. Heaposs been named and shamed with the neckerchief. He wears the banana out and about now. A few people have asked about the slogan. They all laugh.

Ali Bamford, , enlisted her mum Jane to drive her to hospital when she went into labour with her daughter at :am on October . But Ali’s mum had never driven the route to the hospital before and took a wrong turn on the way after a road closure. After a panic she started feeling like she needed to push, Baby Delilah was born at the side of the A. The road is even recorded on her birth certicate.  Mum of four, Ali, from Birstall, West Yorkshire, says: “I had moved house the year before so the route to the hospital was dferent than it had been for my other births. “Part of the motorway was closed so we had to come off at a dferent junction. I started telling Mum I had to push, and she told me she was lost and that I couldn’t push there was total panic in the car. It was so quick, I gave birth right there in the front seat and my mum had to unwrap the umbilical cord because it was all wrapped around my legs. “Delilah is doing really well now and I can’t wait to tell her the story when she’s older.” Ali and her partner, Jamie Firth, , met through his sister, Claire.  The pair have three older daughters, Scarlet, , Lillie, five, and two-year-old Thea. The three older girls were all born in hospital without drama. Ali had called her mum, Jane Wilding, , to take her hospital whilst Jamie remained at home with the other children. Ali says: “My mum arrived in her Renault Megane and she was keen to get going because she’d never driven the new route to the hospital before. “I was more relaxed, pottering about the house getting my bag ready, even though my contractions were about three minutes apart. “We set off, but part of the motorway was closed, and we had to come off at a junction we weren’t familiar with. The contractions suddenly became much stronger and mum was getting in a panic, trying to follow the Sat Nav whilst I was screaming in agony. “I told her the baby was coming and I’d have to push, and she was shouting: ‘You can’t push, we’re lost!’ It was complete chaos. “Mum came off at a slip road, without a clue where we were, and Delilah was born before she could even stop the car. I was wedged in the passenger seat and I caught Delilah in my arms. “Mum dashed round to the passenger side to unwrap the umbilical cord from round my legs. We were both in total shock. We didn’t know what to do. “Amazingly, we spotted a woman going past and she gave us directions to Pinderfields Hospital which was only about a mile away. “I wrapped Delilah in my dressing gown and Mum ran into A and E to get a team of nurses to come out. We hadn’t even cut the cord. It was a crazy hour.” Ali and Delilah remained in hospital for checks before being allowed home later that same afternoon. Three weeks on, both are now doing well. Ali says: “On Delilah’s birth certicate, it says she was born on the A, Carr Gate, West Yorkshire. “Mum was amazing I can’t thank her enough. She had to have the car valeted obviously, and she can’t sell it now – it holds too many precious memories.” Comment MORE ON HospitalsGiving birthSat-nav\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Bina Patel, , from Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside, Manchester, was heard screaming ‘help me, I’m dying, I canapost breathe’ as her son sat beside her and called for the ambulance ‘seven times’ as her condition deteriorated. By the time paramedics got to her home, Bina already had ‘no pulse’, her son Ashkay said. In the weeks following his mother’s death, Ashkay, , is demanding answers and blames North West Ambulance Servicefor her death.He told Manchester Evening News that ‘my mum suffocated for almost an hourapos and that her le aposcould have been saved’.His comments came as new figures revealed patients suffering heart attacks and strokes in Greater Manchester are waiting for more than an hour for an ambulance amid crippling NHS pressure.On October  of this year, Bina, who had worked in the townaposs Asda as a well-known cashier for  years, had been out to meet friends in Leicester, before ing home and heading to bed. All seemed well and she was happy, her son said. But in the early hours of the morning of October , Ashkay woke to the horror of his mum shouting for his help, frightened that she was struggling to breathe. Ashkay claims his mother only had long-term diabetes, no unexpected, underlying conditions that would leave her short of breath. Together the pair, who shared a home after the death of Ashkay’s father, tried to calm Bina’s breathing - but to no avail. Bina began to progressively getting worse and just after .am, Ashkay said he made his first of seven calls to , asking for an ambulance. He said he was told that an ambulance would be on its way and that he should attempt to keep the patient calm, Ashkay said. Over the course of almost  minutes, Ashkay said he called  over and over as no ambulance was arriving and his mother was becoming severely ill.In recordings of two of the  calls, which Ashkay requested from NWAS , Bina’s heartbreaking distress can be heard. In the calls, she can be heard screaming, saying on multiple occasions ‘help me, I’m going to die’, with her screaming being acknowledged by the call handler as Ashkay tries to help his mother. The times of the calls, following the initial report at .am, were .am, .am, .am, .am, .am and another a few seconds later. NWAS provided recordings of the calls at .am and .am. During the call at ., the call handler can be heard saying that the wait for an ambulance is an ‘hour and a half’ as aposweaposre very busy’. In the second recording, from the call at .am, Ashkay tells the emergency service that his mother has now stopped breathing entirely. A call handler can be heard saying that there is ‘nothing’ Ashkay can do to help, and that he should wait for paramedics to arrive. The call handler then says they have ‘another call coming in and [they] have to hang up’. Ashkay said an ambulance and paramedic car arrived at .am, nearly an hour after his initial  call. By this point, he had been doing CPR as directed by the call handler to no effect and his mother was already dead, he said. A patient report completed by NWAS shows that an ambulance was mobile and on the way to the scene at .am. On paramedics’ arrival, Bina was showing aposno pulse, no respirationsapos and had a apossuspected cardiac arrestapos, reads the report. She was pronounced dead shortly after. Ashkay said he has been left aposscarredapos by the loss of his mother and the circumstances in which it happened. The pain is made all the worse by the fact that their home is a stone’s throw away from Tameside Hospital AE, he said.  Tameside Hospital is two minutes up the road from where we live,I could have got her in the car and driven her up there myself, I would have. But she just couldn’t. “At about .am, my mum was struggling to breathe. She shouted my name, I jumped out of bed and saw that she couldnapost even stand. She was wheezing, she looked dizzy. I sat her down, got her a glass of water and I called the ambulance at about .am to tell them she was having breathing dficulties. Knowing the hospital was so close, I expected someone to be there as soon as possible. No one arrived. I left it  minutes, her breathing was just getting more dficult and more dficult. Again, I called the ambulance service to chase, I explained that her breathing was becoming worse. She was screaming and screaming aposI canapost breathe, Iaposm going to dieapos. I genuinely thought she was going to die. I called them seven times that evening. It got to the point where she collapsed on the floor. I rang  and on my final  call at .am, they were telling me how to give CPR to my mum. At .am, five minutes later, thataposs when an ambulance and paramedic car arrived at the scene. They put adrenaline shots in her and put a machine on her and they did fight for her for a good  minutes. But it was too late by then, there was no pulse. I was so angry at them. I told them aposI rang you over an hour ago, thataposs when you should have been here, when she was still alive and just struggling for breath’. Now, Ashkay is demanding answers as to why an ambulance was only able to be mobilised to his home at .am, after he first called to report the breathing dficulties almost  minutes prior.  A le potentially could have been saved that night because she was struggling for breath for a full hour while waiting for the ambulance service, he said. Throughout that whole hour, her lips went from red to white, things I thought Iaposd never witness in my le. Every time I made a call, they kept saying aposcalm the patient downapos. How do you calm someone who is struggling to get breath  An hour before I was there, with my mum, trying to help her get her breath. An hour later, sheaposs lying in front of me, passed away. Iaposm traumatised because there was no help from the people I needed it from. The service that you and I pay into. None of it makes sense to me. Thereaposs unanswered questions, why was I let down  For anyone itaposs heartbreaking to see a parent die in front of you. That whole scenario is always going to be in the back of my mind, Iaposm never going to forget what I witnessed that night. Never in my le. Itaposs just scarred me for le. Knowing the NHS wasnapost there when I needed it. I canapost trust the ambulance service at all. No one can believe the ambulance took that long. The first question the  call handler asks is aposis the patient breathing ’ She just suffocated for that whole hour, imagine being underwater for a full hour, youaposre not going to survive. Thataposs the position the ambulance [service] put her in. If they came in time, something could have been done. The fact that I had to call  to get instructions on how to give CPR to my own mother, itaposs sickening. NWAS is the reason my mum died, in my opinion, they caused her death by not coming in time. I feel like they killed her, I blame them for her death. They didnapost do their jobs properly. I donapost think they took it seriously enough.” NWAS is now doing internal enquiries into the incident, said Ashkay, and has promised him a response within  days. A North West Ambulance Service spokesperson said: “We wish to pass on our deepest sympathies to Mr Patel and his family for the loss of his mother. “We can confirm we have received an official complaint, and the investigation is ongoing. We are in contact with the family and will update them with our findings.” Ashkay and his brother are now left mourning the loss of their beloved mother and are to raising money in her memory for their local temple and the British Heart Foundation. Bina Patel was so well known in the community , Ashkay said. She was the most loving and caring person you could ever come across. Any help and guidance you ever needed, she was there. Even now people are coming to my house talking about the happy times they had with her, I had with her. My mum did the best she could, throughout her entire le. She was so proud of my brother and I and what weaposve achieved. She made Indian feasts for the local homeless shelter, her speciality was cooking, no one is going to cook that feast anymore. She was an amazing person that could connect with anyone in the world. Youaposll never find a character like her, my mum was spectacular.”If you would like to donate to the fundraiser in memory of Bina Patel, head to the JustGiving page.

Sarah, who lives with her three kidsas well as her partner, says she noticed the mould about a year after moving in, but at first, did not know what it was. Once she realised it was mould, she “tried everything” to get rid of it. Cleaning didn’t work, neither did opening the windows, putting the heating on - or any other home remedy for mould. Speaking toCornwall Live , she realised it was being caused by damp and had spread across the house.“It was in every single room,” Sarah said. “Even in the hallway. In the kitchen, my bedroom, the girlsapos room. I saw in theirs the wallpaper had begun to pull down with damp under there. “When environmental health came they ran their hand down the wall and it was soaking.” Pictures taken by Sarah showed the extent of the mould problem. It coats the lower walls of most rooms, and is particularly shocking against the pink wallpaper of her childrenaposs bedroom. Sarah said that the issue has persisted for the past four years. The damp flares up several times a year, she said, getting worse in the cold and wet months. WIth the colder months came more black mould. Sarah reported the issue to environmental health around six months after first discovering the damp - having hoped she could fix it herself at first - and then contacted Rev Livingston, the landlord. She said he was extremely unhappy she had called in professional help and refused to fix it. He continued to tell her he will not fix anything and that the house is entirely her responsibility. When asked what Sarah should do, he suggested she simply move out. “Move out with what funds ” Sarah continued, “I can’t just up and move, I don’t have themoneyfor that.And besides, have you tried to find somewhere to live in Cornwall  “I’m on every site, I’m on the list for Coastline Housing. I’m putting myself out there but I can’t. “It’s a nightmare, my daughter is mildly asthmatic and it gets worse with the mould. My other kids never used to get coughs but now they’re always spluttering. “My partner has breathing issues and it makes it worse too. I am afraid of people coming over to my house.  “It’s not messy, but the mould makes me feel like it’s dirty and disgusting.” The mould was last reported around a week and a half ago.

The three-year-old, who has not yet been named, died following the collision in Yardley, Birmingham on Thursday. It is understood that she was wheeling across Reddings Lane at around :pm after leaving the Olive School early - when she was hit by a Ford Galaxy. She was rushed to hospital but later died from her injuries. Police say the driver of the silver car did not stop, but a man was later arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. And witnesses on Friday said the the mum of the victim watched on as the horror incident happened.Do you know what happened  Do you know the victim  Email webnews@mirror.Mohammed aposAliapos Hussain, who lives on nearby Weston Lane, said: I didnapost seen anything but my we saw a bit of the incident but then police were moving people from the area. It was a three-year-old girl who had been picked up by her mother from school slightly early. The young girl was on a scooter and made it   of the way into the zebra crossing already and the mum was at the zebra crossing - she witnessed the whole thing. We didnapost know the girl, but have placed flowers outside the schools. Itaposs really sad. Other locals have claimed the road is a rat run - and drivers regularly go over the speed limit. It is thought that the zebra crossing where the girl died is used by pupils and parents from three schools: Yardley Secondary School, Olive Schooland Al-Furqan Primary School, all within  yards of each other. There is only one set of traffic lights which is for the intersection of Battery Way and Reddings Lane. One neighbour, who lives directly opposite Olive School - a school which only opened this year - said: This area is a total rat run. Cars just belt across, not even taking into consideration of the mph speed limit. I didnapost witness the event, but heard a police sirens when the incident took place at around .. How the council gave planning permission to build another school on this road I do not know. It just gets too busy. The air ambulance landed on the park which is just behind Al-Furqan Primary School. We didnapost know the girl, but I know she was three-years-old. Opposite Olive School is Royal Food and Wine Off-Licence, Winston Fernando was working when the incident happened. He said: When they opened Olive School about eight months ago, when they finish the school day, the all use the one zebra crossing - that is for Yardley School too.  There are no signal lights only the one traffic light at the intersection, that is it. The problem is that the amount of traffic that accumulates at the end of the school day - for three schools - is horrendous. You have cars parked where they shouldnapost, I have even saw cars parked on the zebra crossing. People donapost care, you can see that it is the end of the school day and it is busy - still they drive straight through. Whoever did, did not stop he just carried on driving through like nothing had happened. People moan about the school being here, itaposs too late now. This awful incident has happened and the school is there. The council must do more. I saw lots of police and ambulance here when the three year old girl was struck, she was then taken to the park when she was taken to hospital by air ambulance. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information and changes at www.mirror email .Another neighbour, who lives nearly Yardley School, did not wintess the incident but said: When the schools finish, it is totally manic around here. Loads of cars park up: on pavements, in side streets, even on the zebra crossing itself. It comes to a total standstill, then you have traffic waiting from the busy Battery Way. Unfortunately, something like this was bound to happen at some point. It is quite a small area, with roads with no driveways, to have three schools in. West Midlands Police said on Thursday that officers had arrested a man, aged , on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A statement said: It is understood the girl was using a zebra crossing when she was hit by a silver Ford Galaxy just before .pm today . The driver of the car failed to stop at the crossing but officers swtly took witness accounts and statements, and arrested a -year-old man on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after locating his vehicle in the area.  The girl’s family were with her at the time of the tragedy. Acting Insp Paul Hughes added: The tragic death of such a young child is deeply saddening. Our thoughts are with the girl’s family at this incredibly distressing time. Our priority is supporting her family and ensuring that a thorough investigation is carried out. We understand the shock and worry this may have caused the community and ask people not to speculate on the circumstances. I’m keen to hear from anyone who was on Reddings Lane or the immediate vicinity and may have witnessed the collision or heard anything that may assist our investigation.Mohammed, whose we is said to have witnessed the incident, has set up a fundraising page for the victimaposs family.As a father I understand and feel their pain. The family must be going through some dficulties at the moment, that is why I have set up a fundraising page. I am trying to reach £ and so far at £.

Statistics from the British Heart Foundation show that every eight minutes somebody dies from coronary heart disease and the importance to take steps to keep the organ healthy.High cholesterol is extremely common and it increases your risk of heart attack and disease, so it is crucial to keep it at a healthy level, reported the Irish Mirror.For good heart health and healthy cholesterol, the BHF recommends people have a diet with fruit and vegetables, and less fatty food.  What is High Cholesterol  Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood which is made in the body mainly by the liver and it is needed for all body cells to produce important hormones. Butthere is too much cholesterol in your blood, it sticks to your artery walls to form atheroma or plaque. This build-up on the artery walls means your arteries become narrowed and this process also called the hardening of the arteries. If an artery supplying the heart muscle becomes blocked completely, the muscle becomes damaged and this is known as a heart attack. Similarlyan artery to the brain is completely blocked, it damages the brain and this is called a stroke.  Symptoms of High Cholesterol High cholesterol in itself does not usually cause symptoms but the build-up of fatty material on the artery walls and the narrowing does leave to ious conditions and these depend on where the blockage occurs.Angina Acute coronary syndrome Heart attackthe heart is affected Stroke or TIAthe brain is affected Leg pain and intermittent pain when walkingthe peripheral arteries are affected.The body can produce all the cholesterol it needs and can usually maintain a healthy level of blood cholesterol. Good cholesterolHDL cholesterol is called good cholesterol or healthy cholesterol because it mops up cholesterol left behind in your arteries and carries it to your liver where it is broken down and passed out of your body. Regular physical activity and exercise can help increase your HDL level but problems arise when the balance goes wrong and there is an increase in bad cholesterol called LDL. This may result from inherited problems or from eating too much saturatedfat or too many foods from the top shelf of the Food Pyramid.  Bad cholesterolLDL cholesterol travels from your liver through your arteries to other parts of your body. LDL is called bad cholesterol because it sticks to the walls in your arteries - making them narrow. Prevention If you want to prevent high cholesterol here are some things you can do.You should have regular blood pressure and cholesterol checks with your doctor. Eat more fruit and vegetables and wholegrain foods Eat less fatty foods Eat fish twice a week including oily fish If you smoke, try to stop Be a healthy weight Be more physically active for at least  minutes  days a week Drink less alcohol Learn to relax, de-stress – take time out for yourself.Comment MORE ON Blood pressureHeart attackHeart diseaseFitnessCholesterol\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Chamberlain said scaffolding was put up around her home in early October, with alterations to be made to external pipework and building materials put in her front and back gardens. By the end of the month I was told that the project had ended, she continued. God knows how much government money has been wasted in the process. Ms Chamberlain was due to have external wall insulation for free after she successfully applied for a Green Homes Grant, a scheme funded by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The grants have been handed out and the work is being carried out in phases. Ms Chamberlain applied for a grant in March, but she claims E.On said they would be unable to finish the work before a deadline at the end of October. The company said this was due to the fact they were trying to complete work for as many homes as possible in the window after applications closed on March . E.On said they had apologised to Ms Chamberlain and would remove the building materials and fix the pipework as a matter of urgency. A spokesperson told NottinghamshireLive: Unfortunately it wasn’t possible to complete the external wall insulation at this property under the government-led Green Homes Grant Local Authority Delivery scheme before this phase of it closed.

John Woodsapos -year-old daughter, Carly, had been playing outside with her friends and brothers and was her aposnormal happy selfapos the day before she felt unwell. She was taken to hospital after she started to feel worse and doctors gave her family a devastating diagnosis - she had a rare form of liver cancer.Her liver was four times larger than it should have been and it was ram packed and stuffed with multiple tumours, John, , told the Liverpool Echo. Carly, whose family lives in Skelmersdale, died on November  at Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital.  John, who lives in with his partner, Kelly [Carlyaposs mum], and their children, said: She woke up on the Sunday morning and said, aposdad, Iaposve got a belly acheapos. I was putting clothes away and I just said, wellyouaposre trying to get out of school Iaposm still sending you. It was her first year in senior school and she was having a bit of trouble settling in. I thought she was trying to play on it. As the day went on she was moaning a little bit more and I asked her what sheaposd had for her breakfast this morning. She said she wasnapost really hungry. I said youaposve probably got hunger pains, get downstairs and Iaposll do you your dinner.  I did her something to eat but she didnapost really eat much of it. It got to bed time and she was whimpering a little bit so Kelly just gave her some Ibuprofen. Kelly come back in the bedroom and said I think she might have appendicitis. I said weaposll see how she gets on tomorrow morning. At five oaposclock in the morning, my partner wakes me and says can you take the day off and watch the baby, Iaposm going to take her to the hospital. Carly was taken to Ormskirk Hospital where she underwent scans and tests. Appendicitis was ruled out but the parents were told their daughteraposs liver was bigger than it should be and doctors didnapost understand the reason why. Carly was in hospital for four days undergoing more tests until she was eventually transferred to Alder Hey. It was there that further scans prompted doctors to break some devastating news to her parents. John said: I was called into the office and the doctor told me that straight away they could see on the ultrasound her liver was four times larger than it should be and it was just ram packed and stuffed with multiple tumours. John said the news left them in shock but worse was to come as further tests showed that the cancer had spread to the little girlaposs lungs.  Carly had been diagnosed with a rare type of liver cancer called aposhepatocellular neoplasm not otherwise specied HC-NOSapos. John said: They said they only see one or two of these cancers each year and normally thereaposs some sort of pre-warning, usually the kid has been in hospital or been sick before. Doctors told the parents they would need to administer an invasive and experimental form of chemotherapy immediately to rid Carlyaposs lungs of tumours before she would be able to have a liver transplant. Surgery was performed to prepare Carly for the chemotherapy by inserting a line in the side of her neck, but afterwards doctors were having trouble bringing her around. After she eventually woke up, Carlyaposs parents were told they would have to get her salt levels higher before they could administer the treatment and so the parents went home for the night.  The next day, a doctor called them both back into the hospital. John said: We went back in on the Sunday morning and they told us there was medically nothing they could do. Her liver was pretty much clapped out and not ing. She wouldnapost physically be able to take the chemotherapy, it would be too cruel. They told us that we would have to make the decision to not resuscitate her and just keep her comfortable and let her pass. Carly lived for another week before she died, surrounded by her loving parents, on November . John said: I think for both of us itaposs not even sunk in yet. Iaposm still numb.

At first glance it looks like a little outbuilding and you wouldnapost expect it to be a house. But the one-bed property in Notting Hill is deceptively small from the outside - similar to Doctor Whoaposs police box Tardis which is actually huge on the inside. And once the lucky owner has entered the building, theyaposll find a surprisingly roomy maisonette over two floors. It has been designed to maximise the space available and both the bedroom and kitchen are slimmer than a London bus. A little living room is the first ting prospective buyers will encounter when they come through the door, complete with a cosy sofa and widescreen TV.  Shelves help maximise the space without bulky furniture. And next to that is sleek, modern kitchen, with hob laid fitted microwave at head height.It is being marketed by Homesite, Notting Hill, on Rightmove aposs property site.The owner, in the fashionable area, has built a breakfast bar below a window. A skylight above, meanwhile, allows plenty of sunshine in and makes the room look bigger.  Agents Homesite say the property is based in Powis Mews, where homes can fetch £.million, and they say it has much to recommend it. The brochure states: Itaposs located a stoneaposs throw away from the market, boutiques and cafes of Portobello Road and Westbourne Grove. Sliding doors take the viewer to the little bedroom which measures just ft in across compared to a Routemaster bus which is ft in wide.  A double bed is lit by pendant-style lightbulbs which shine above the mattress The current owner has not cluttered the home with furniture and instead relies on built-in wardrobes and shelving. The estate agent adds: The apartment has a modern fully fitted kitchen with brand new Siemens appliances. The ground floor level benefits from high ceilings, large sash windows, a skylight and bespoke carpentry with a feature spiral staircase.  The lower ground level consists of a study area with built in wardrobes, a separate bedroom area and family bathroom that has been finished to an exceptional standard. The capital is well-known for its creative solutions to maximise space. One trendy flat in an upscale postcode is on the market for a knock-down price, it was on for a rental price of£ a week. It boasted a large shower, opposite the kitchenette, but there was no toilet to be seen.  Elsewhere, a double room in Finsbury, in north of the city, was on the market for £ a month, but the new tenant had no bedroom It provided a mattress beneath its eaves, with a hammock slung nearby There was also a large garden and a movie room set up. But any renter will need to share with more than  other people, as well as three cats.

Jayde Madle controversially told her flataposs owner to use the deposit as her final payment before moving from London to the US this month, believing he wouldn’tthe bond eventhe property was spotless.The move angered the landlord, who hit back at her scheme by calling her a “liar” as well as “greedy and spoiled”apos, so she shamed him on Twitter by sharing a screengrab of his scathing rant.The former University of Westminster student has since split the internet with her bold move, with many praising her and claiming his rant is evidence heaposd aposalready spent her depositapos. Others have sympathised with the unknown property owner and claimed Jayde should pay the final monthaposs rent as itaposs aposwhat everyone signs up toapos. Her posts brand the landlord a “cowboy” and claim she was forced to act as he aposstole previous tenantsapos depositsapos and hers wasnapost registered on a Government-approved tenancy deposit protection scheme.The landlordaposs scathing WhatsApp response said: My thoughts on you  Jayde you are lower than scum and people laugh at you. You are a liar, arrogant, snidey, greedy, and spoilt and I would be embarrassed to be associated with you. Maybe you are just immature and will grow out of it. Good riddance. Jayde insisted sheaposs never had issues with a landlord before and even goes for drinks with one of her previous flataposs owners, but says the message she shared was aposjust the tip of the icebergapos. Her tweets have more than , likes and theyaposve split opinion, with some suggesting her plan is aposheroicapos while others claim she should pay the final monthaposs rent.

Iaposve rented in London for the past five years and never had an issue with a landlord before. @Rydel commented: Your deposit isnapost meant to be used as a final rent unless it was agreed in writing. He should have taken six weeks off you. Poor guy. One user named Matt said: I donapost agree with this message but also the rent should be paid until you leave and then the deposit edthe property is in order. This is all set out from the start. Itaposs what everyone signs up to. However other users backed her plan and suggested his sweary reaction to it suggested he would never have ed her deposit in the first place. Redwoman: This is top landlord-shafting. I trust your judgement that youaposd have never seen your deposit again. I didnapost see either of mine when I rented. Good work.  A user called Seanie said: He wasnapost so embarrassed to be associated with you when you were paying off his mortgage. Simon added: Iaposm calling that game, set and match to you. Very well played. Another user added: Tell me your landlord plans on stealing the deposit without telling me your landlord plans on stealing your deposit. Thereaposs no way he would react like thishis intentions are good. A user called Fred said: Oh dear me, I think heaposs very angry with you because your deposit money was going to be spent on his Christmas. That means youaposve just ruined his Christmas.

Thomas Markle slammed his daughter following revelations from her then press secretary Jason Knauf that she was aware about the book Finding Freedom. The Duchess of Sussex said she had not remembered emails between her and Mr Knauf despite a spokesperson for the Sussexes insisting they did not collaborate with the authors on the book, nor were they interviewed for it In a damning interview on GB News on Thursday evening, he claimed: I cant speak to much about this but I think she was trying to deceive.  I think she was telling lies. Finally the truth is coming out and thank god for Jason Knauf. I would like him to come over so I can take him out for a steak. Meghan has apologised in a new witness statement, where she accepted that Mr Knauf did brief the authors of Finding Freedom with Meghanaposs knowledge. She said: I apologise to the Court for the fact that I had not remembered these exchanges at the time. I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the Defendant or the Court.  The Duchess added that had she known about the emails she would have been more than happy to refer to them as strongly supportive of her case.In the interview Thomas claimed Meghan had demanded he stopped talking to his two older children and that she had ghosted her family from both sides after marrying Prince Harry.Meghan has claimed that her two older half-siblings Samantha and Thomas had said hurtful things about her in the past.  The interview this evening comes as the Associated Newspapers Limited - the publishers of the Mail on Sunday - appeals against a summary judgement given earlier this year. Meghan had sued the company over five articles that reproduced parts of a personal and private letter sent to her dad in August . The High Court ruled ANLaposs publication of Meghanaposs letter to her father was unlawful, meaning there was no need for a trial. Mr Markle last appeared on British TV screens at the end of October when he was interviewed on Good Morning Britain.  The show was subsequently hit with a  Ofcom complaints by viewers unhappy that he had sounded off about his estranged daughter once again. The Duchess of Sussex has been the subject of a number of cutting remarks from her father and he also tore into Prince Harryaposs new tell-all book, which he branded shameful.  During the attack on the Sussexes Thomas claimed he was being ghosted by Meghan and has vowed to continue to publicly attack his daughter until she begins speaking to him again. I think Harry has abandoned the Queen, the royal family, the British people and the Army. Heaposs abandoned them all, he said on GMB. I’ve made it quite clear until I hear from her until she does speak to me that I’ll continue to do this.  I will do a show for at least a monthI can get it through and eventually sooner or later she should start talking to me - this is way too childish. This is kind of silly. It’s time to talk with each other. We’re family. At one point the retired lighting director said heaposd considered taking legal action in a bid to see his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet. Some viewers found that suggestion galling. Thereaposs something quite tone deaf about Thomas Markle, one person wrote on social media. Surely youaposd know that your daughter has cut you off because you keep bashing her to the press  How can you be that unaware  The last time Mr Markle went on GB News was back in August this year.  He was asked by Wootton for his response to Meghanaposs comments about him, regarding the infamous paparazzi pictures he staged with an agency before her wedding. The Duchess had, in an interview with Oprah, implied her dad had intentionally caused her pain with the photos. My first response is whataposs going to happen to these children  her dad said. I donapost know what terrible things are going to happen to these children because I did some photos, I donapost know what theyaposre talking about, what Harry is talking about, he kept saying apos you do that only one kid will be protectedapos, not two, I donapost know what heaposs talking about. Why am I being picked on  It seems Iaposm very easily picked on.

The woman claims she was trapped with a driver in a queue on the M when she felt the car “shaking” and heard a “rubbing noise” before she asked him “are you masturbating”. The driver didn’t respond, she said. Feeling uncomfortable, she alleged she got out of the car to seek the help of a nearby police officer. But she says the officer told her he found her claim “very doubtful” and when she askedhe doubted her he simply ‘shrugged his shoulders’. The incident is now being investigated by Greater Manchester Police’s professional standards branch. The force has also apologised for “any instances whereby a member of the public has not received a good service from us”. Uber says they have suspended the driver’s account while an investigation takes place. The woman - who spoke to the Manchester Evening News and has not been named - requested an Uber to take her home from a work event in Manchester city centre just after pm on Thursday night last week.She was sitting in the back seat behind the driver, she said, when the car ground to a halt as they neared a police road closure around the site of an accident. So I was waiting in the taxi trying to chat to the driver and he was a bit grumpy. I put my rucksack on the seat next to me to rest my head,” she said. I noticed the car started shaking and I could hear this rubbing noise. I asked aposwhat are you doing apos. This went on and it stopped and started. I moved to the middle seat to try and distract him and tried to talk to him, asking how long he thought we would be here. I wanted him to stop. I text my husband and said aposIaposm fairly confident the driver of this Uber is masturbatingapos. He phoned me and said to put him on the phone but I didnapost want the driver to take my phone. There was a bit of this starting and stopping and the car shaking and the rubbing noise. I never actually saw his penis, buthe was not doing that he certainly wanted me to think he was. I said aposIaposm getting outapos and asked aposAre you masturbatingapos and he didnapost respond. The woman says she got out of the car onto the motorway and approached a nearby police officer. She explained the situation but was told she needed to get back inside her vehicle. He asked which car it was and started walking me back to the car, she says. I told him I wasnapost getting back in that taxi and he said aposyouaposre going to have to because you canapost stand out in the carriagewayapos. The woman says the officer then aposreluctantlyapos agreed to let her sit in the back of the police car. When she asked what their plan was she was told the officer could drop her at a shopping centre many miles from her home. She was there for around  minutes before anyone spoke to her properly, she says. Sometime later, she says another officer arrived and askedshe would like them to arrest the Uber driver. “I said ‘yeah’,” she says. “They askedI could identy him and I told them the name and car was on my Uber app. I told him what had happened and he told me this case was unlikely to get a prosecution. They had not even taken my name at that point. “By then I was more worried about how I would get home. I said ‘okay, leave it’. Then the first officer came over tomy phone and said ‘I find it very doubtful that a man would do this whilst he knows he’s trapped in the traffic’. “I said ‘are you telling me this didn’t happen’ and he just shrugged his shoulders and passed me the phone.” The woman says officers dropped her at McDonald’s, in Hattersley, where her husband had ordered her a cab home. She has since reported both the alleged crime and her complaint about officers’ conduct. They said there would be an investigation and I would get a written outcome,” she says. In my opinion that is quite a dangerous officer because he is not only inept and didnapost take a report, but he also tried to get me back in the taxi,” she added. From that driveraposs perspective heaposs seen me go to the police and seen them try to put me back in his car. If I had not been so insistent I could have ended back in that Uber. And someone  with perhaps less le experience might have. It was a sex crime. I was in a position where I was vulnerable, I told a police officer and you think they would at least get you home safe. A spokesperson for the Greater Manchester Police force said: Firstly, we completely acknowledge the effect incidents of this nature can have on victims, and we are sorry for any instances whereby a member of the public has not received a good service from us. Our job as police officers is to keep the public safe. We want all members of our community, especially women and girls, to feel they are not at risk of harm when going about their daily lives in Greater Manchester and we are working with partners across Greater Manchester to better achieve this. We can confirm that GMP has received a complaint regarding the police response to this incident which is in the process of being assessed by our Professional Standards Branch. “As a result it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time. An Uber spokesperson said: We are appalled by this allegation and have a zero tolerance policy on any such behaviour in the Uber community. “In this case the driveraposs account has been suspended while an investigation takes place.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Greater Manchester PoliceAppsPolice carShopping centresCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lola Hall,  and from Camden, London, has been grappling with stabbing period pains ever since she had her first menstrual cycle aged . The pain persisted and got worse through adulthood, with it becoming so extreme at about the age of  that Lola felt like I didnapost want to be around anymore... Not because I wasn’t a valuable person or I hated myself but because I was in so much pain and my le was so heavily disrupted by the endometriosis that it didn’t feel like a le worth living.”Lola would at times have to ask her mother to help her while showeringbecause I couldn’t hold myself up long enough, while she would only have microwaved food as she didnapost trust herself with the stove because of the strong painkillers she was on, such as dihyrocodeine. My pain levels were at about  and the only reason they weren’t  is because I wasn’t blacked out most of the time, but I was screaming in pain on a daily basis, I was writhing in pain, the painkillers wouldn’t touch it.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments belowYet despite the searing pain, Lola, who is part of the Endometriosis UK support group in London, has in the past felt like she had no option but to go to work for fear of being penalised.Lola said her condition has in the past been perceived as a negative aspect of me or an inconvenience, and that has in turn had an impact on her mental health and performance. It become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. They demonise you and then you become more stressed, more likely to make mistakes and you become sicker from the stress. The -year-old was once also put under review, although she pointed out how her employers at the time werenapost aware her absence was due to her period. Lola said she felt her condition wouldnapost be seen as a real sickness. aposMiles behindapos Despite the UK being one of the most advanced countries in the world, its employment law still falls short of stipulating that women with premenstrual syndromecan take time off work. A survey of , UK women aged - from London-based company Yoppie found  per cent would support menstrual leave becoming a legal workplace requirement, compared to just six percent who were strongly against it. That while a total of  per cent said their workplace fell short of having any form of menstrual leave in place.Daniella Peri, the founder of Yoppie , said the UK is still miles behind countries like Indonesia, Zambia, parts of China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, where menstrual leave is already legally enforced.Some will argue that our general sick leave policies are sufficient to cover menstrual leave, buta woman is having to take a day or two sick leave every month compared to the average of four or five sick days a year, employers may start to look unfavourably on them, Ms Peri said.  It’s this stigma that causes many to refrain from taking time off work when PMS hits in fear that they won’t be treated equally against their male counterparts. She added thatchange canapost happen via the government, they want to empower woman to campaign for the change in their own workplace sowe can start to make a change one company at a time.”aposI felt like an absolute corpseapos Lola had a laparoscopy two years ago and has now been put on a new medication which she calls a leline. But when her body was first adjusting to the treatment - an intake of hormones six times the typical dose - she felt like an absolute corpse and had to take three weeks of sick leave. She is grateful to have supportive employers who allowed her to do that, but realises they are the exception, not the rule.Explaining the extent to which the endometriosis can affect you, she said it can in some ways be compared to cancer because of how the cells behave and similar symptoms. A prostate chemotherapy drug which triggers a chemical menopause is also sometimes used to manage endometriosis, but the side effects are horrible.Backing calls for menstrual leave to be granted to employees affected by severe period-related symptoms, she said: “If you had a member of staff that had cancer or had diabetes - because diabetes affects the same amount of people that endometriosis does - they would be treated fairly at work. “But for some reason as soon as periods are brought into it, vaginas are brought into it, uteruses are brought into it, suddenly it’s no longer medical, suddenly it’s an icky woman’s issue we don’t talk about”. Endometriosis UK called on the government to urgently review how its policies on benefits and statutory sick pay are applied to those with endometriosis so they are not discriminated against due to having a condition linked to the menstrual cycle.” The charity, which supports , women across the country, told the Mirror: Endometriosis is not ‘just a bad period’. Those with the disease may have severe, debilitating pain. We don’t need generic menstrual leave we need employers, the Department of Work and Pensions and society to recognise endometriosis as a chronic condition and provide the support that they would to anyone with a chronic health condition.

The account also claimed that NASA would find a mirrored Earth in August and that eight humans would receive superpowers from the extreme energy of the Sun in October. One of the accountaposs predictions that caught a lot of attention was a clip that suggested that “something amazing happens on August , .” They said: There will be a very large meteor shower that lasts for  weeks, it will be seen in the Northern hemisphere, containing the Nozic Message. One of the meteors will seem dferent than all the others, that is because it is a ship landing on Earth, starting preparations for the first Nozic War.” Many were quick to voice their opinion on the theory, with one user even calling out the TikToker whose account has over . million likes and , followers, writing: First thing I would do as a time traveller: create a TikTok. A second user joked that it was “going to happen right when they turn on that G,” with another person adding Nothing heaposs said has come true. Tell us something legit.

Music plays in the background of the clip as a voiceover begins: True democracy can exist only among our people prepared from childhood for the responsibilities of citizenship. “Recognising this fact, the American people have built up over the generations, a vast nationwide system of public schools intended to give every child in the United States the opportunity for a thorough education. “US schools have been forced to hire some , emergency teachers who lack the qualication ordinarily required in their state. “Some of them never got beyond the primary grades and most of them have had no professional training for their jobs.

She is evidently struggling, erasing and re-starting the formula a number of times before the students break into laughter. The footage then moves on to show a geography teacher, a character which the voiceover notes as being unfit to teach children successfully, before a teacher who represents the correct way to teach is filmed encouraging students to ask questions and not to just believe something because other people do. As the depicted maths teacher struggles, it suggests that even some  years ago, there was a general maths skills shortage, just as there is today.

Amy Pierpoint is no stranger to having wacky, colourful hair dos, but the interior designer got more than she bargained for, after her subtle grey-blue do turned bright turquoise, matching her own hallway.Things started to go wrong for Amy due to a tinge of yellow which was left in her hair from a previous do, causing the blue-rinse to go an entirely dferent colour than expected. I just wanted a purpley kind of Mrs Slocombe-type blue rinse - an old lady kind of blue - I didnapost want a shocking turquoise,the -year-old explained. If Iaposd seen it on someone  I would have said aposah thataposs amazingapos but it just wasnapost me, it just wasnapost right. But, it wasnapost until Amy got home that she released her vibrant new hair do was a perfect match for her eye-catching hallway wall - and she was perfectly camouflaged against it. She said: It was only when my mum dropped me off, I went into the house and I walked down my hallway that I realised my hair was exactly the same colour and I camouflaged perfectly against the wall. I really wanted to like it but in my heart I knew it had got to go. I felt embarrassed going outside, which is such a stupid thing because I wear ridiculous clothes and this blue hairaposs fine [that I currently have]. Iaposm not embarrassed by this blue hair so why was I embarrassed by that  People look at me all the time, itaposs nothing new, but I was walking around town thinking aposplease donapost look at meapos. That hair colour was a step too far, I just didnapost feel myself.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.

Iaposve done it for years and itaposs something that Iaposm perfectly capable of doing. Over the years Iaposve been pretty much every colour except green but because my style is pretty much , s and s - I will only do things that could have been done in those eras. My hair was a baby pink colour, then a really light mauve, then it was more purple, then I decided to try something dferent and go for blue. Iaposd taken the colour out with bleach and then put the blue on it but I think, even though my hair was virtually white-blonde, just the tinge of yellow in my hair made it more turquoise. Despite giving it a go for a week, Amy wasnapost a fan and used a deeper colour from the Revolution Beauty range to achieve the colour she wanted. Amy said: It stayed that colour about a week and then decided I needed to sort it as Iaposd had enough. All it took was just a hint of purple and I ended up with the Mrs Slocombe blue I wanted. It wasnapost the productaposs fault, it was mine. Even though itaposs another shade of blue itaposs within my comfort zone. I love the turquoise colour in my hallway, itaposs one of my favourite colours, just not on my head.

Pingu was underweight and dehydrated, forcing medics to fit him with a feeding tube. Harry Singh, who spotted the penguin on the beach at Birdlings Flat, to the south of Christchurch, said he initially thought he was a soft toy - and he did not move for an hour.Mr Singh told the BBC : First I thought ita soft toy, suddenly the penguin moved his head , so I realised it was real. He was walking with his we when he spotted Pingu, and worried that he might become a target for other animals after his long journey. He said: We did not want it to end up in a dogaposs or cataposs stomach. Mr Singh put in calls to penguin experts, who were baffled to discover Pingu was so far from his natural habitat. After being nursed back to full health, it is expected that Pingu will be released onto a nearby beach, where there are no dogs allowed. It is only the third time that an Adélie penguin has been found in New Zealand, with previous occasions dating back to  and . Experts will be carrying out work to find outthe latest instance is the result of a worrying change in the oceans. Otago University zoology professor Philip Seddon told: “All species of penguin are like marine sentinels … when they’re doing badly, they’re giving us an early signal – canaries in coalmines – an early signal that things are not good.He continued: I thinkwe started getting annual arrivals of Adélie penguins, weaposd go actually, somethingaposs changed in the ocean that we need to understand. More studies will give us more understanding where penguins go, what they do, what the population trends are like - theyaposre going to tell us something about the health of that marine ecosystem in general.

As COP was originally to be held in November that year, a small group of Scottish artists planned to use the power of music in a live performance to promote global wellbeing and climate justice.With pilot funding from Creative Scotland, community music group Oi Musica, specialising in street band music, joined forces with the all-inclusive Soundhouse Choir and award-winning folk musician Karine Polwart.As inspiration, Karine drew on the mythology of Saint Mungo and Glasgow#s famous #the tree, the bird, the fish and the bell#.The song Enough is Enough was born.As the pandemic took hold and the conference was postponed, plans changed. The piece became a music video, and the idea to invite many more people to add their voice took shape.An invitation was put out to community groups to record their own version of the song to increase pressure on leaders to make decisive action at COP .Described as #a crashing, tumbling outpouring of music that starts with a few small drops, gathering pace and momentum as more people join, and building to a climax# the full force was unleashed at .pm on Wednesday November  in Govan with a mass performance as part of COP .At Govan was Tayvallich-based musician Sarah Phizacklea # but on the Saturday before travelling to Glasgow Sarah invited a group of people from Tayvallich, Carsaig and Crinan to her barn to create their version of Enough is Enough.Sarah explained: #It felt wonderful to add some weight to such an important cause, a bit more pressure on our leaders to actually commit to tackling climate change. And it was so much fun!#Our video has been uploaded to the growing collection of voices from all over the country and globally.#There were about  of us in total. It was filmed by Mark and Jane Smith, James Lehmann did the sound recording and the singers were Mary McNeill, Iona Barr, Kathie Baer, Kathie Fe, Jan Aksnes, Charlie Silverton, Ulla Hammervig, Fiona Lowrie, Biddy Simpson, Mary McLauchlan and Val Beattie.The band were Nils Aksnes, Keira Anderson, Kevin Williams and Hugh Fe. Nicholas Mes of the Tavallich shop fed us a fabulous warming stew.#She added: #I know the people who wrote it and thought the idea of everyone singing the same song with the same message was so powerful and gave a feeling of hope, that together we can solve the climate crisis.#The group#s video can be seen on Facebook or on Vimeo vimeo #.

I recall from distant student days a symposium in Glasgow University Union at which Norman MacCaig declared: ldquoEvery poet in Scotland is a Scottish nationalist: other eminent figures of the literary scene were also present, and certainly none of them raised a dissenting voice. That was more than half a century ago but I can think of precious few Scottish writers from that day to this who have not been overt supporters of independence.The association of our national literature with the cause of independence is not, as Sheila Wallace appears to think, a recent disreputable aberration, but a central fact of the entire field, particularly in the th and st centuries. Why  does she think generations of Scottish schoolchildren have been deliberately kept in ignorance of most of it :Why Scotland is the luckiest country in the worldDerrick McClure, Aberdeen.SCOTS MUSIC IS NOT NATIONALISTICCORRESPONDENCE from John Dunlopand Sheila Wallacedescribes alarm that Scottish music, poetry and literature is somehow spoiled and exploited by \"nationalists\".Our culture had been founded in a wild amalgamation of local and international influences. I play traditional music and the number of tunes that share Irish and Scottish roots is considerable.This music is not nationalistic, rather it is very local, with styles and repertoire changing from area to area. It is also international, shared by enthusiastic players across the globe.Allan McDougall, Neilston.TIME TO LOOK AT OUTSIDE FUNDINGOPPONENTS of self-government get worked up when celebrities have their tuppence worth, but far more insidious is people living outside Scotland spending large sums to secretly influence events in Scotland, normally by extreme right-wing organisations, and the Electoral Commission needs to clamp down on anonymous third-party funding in elections and referenda.For example, the recently published expenditure for Mayrsquos Scottish elections included pound, by the anti-independence grouping Scotland Matters, who were bankrolled to the extent of pound, by the unknown Centre for Economic Education and Training, which only has a London PO Box address with no record of who is a member or who is funding it and did not register with the Electoral Commission. A further pound, donation to Scotland Matters was from a London-based former Tory researcher, so the vast bulk of its funding was from outside Scotland.The same applies to the new Scotland Office minister, and Lords peer, Malcolm Offordrsquos so-called grass roots London-based No Borders organisation that spent pound, during the  referendum campaign and received pound, from Stalbury Trustees, which is based in England and whose stated company objects is ldquothe promotion of the Conservative Party.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.IN SEARCH OF COMPROMISEWILLIE Macleanis quite mistaken to describe my position on a second referendum as being that future voters ldquoshould never have the opportunity to cast a vote on the independence question.On the contrary, as regular readers know, I have consistently argued for a New Act of Union that provides a unilateral route to secession, subject to a referendum based on best practice where . This is my reasonable suggestion for a compromise which respects the outcome of  vote and would ensure that independence would only happenit was the settled will of a clear majority.However, the concepts of ldquoreasonable and ldquocompromise are unrecognisable to the nationalist mindset.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.LITTLE HAS CHANGED SINCE THE SNP has never really got over its defeat in the  referendum.It is certainly worth noting that in the most recent Holyrood elections the number of votes cast for the SNP amounted to ,,, whilst the Conservative Labour Liberal Democrat voters added up to ,,. In percentage terms this is roughly a ratio of .   ., which is very close to the results in the independence referendum. So one can only conclude that nothing really much has changed ndash the majority of Scots still wish to remain in the UK.The recent agreement on the part of the SNP to come to a deal with the largely unelected Scottish Greens merely leads to a greater impasse, rather than any political advantage.One could well suggest that this is just another attempt to by the SNP to try to undermine the sound economy and political leadership of these islands. Scotlands future will be far safer politically, and economically,it continues as a constituent part of the UK.Robert IG Scott, Ceres, Fe.A BARON ARGUMENTDR Angus Macmillanrefers to the fact that the Labour Party has colluded with the system associated with appointments to the House of Lords for years. Who once said \"The House of Lords must go ndash not be reformed, not be replaced, not be reborn in some nominated le after-death patronage paradise, just closed down, abolished, finished\"  Answer: Neil Kinnock in  .What is he today  Answer: Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty.That just about says it all.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.EUROPE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONSRETIRED Irish Defence Force Colonel Dorcha Lee writes that ldquoBelgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are storing US nuclear weapons, without any public concern . Polling by ICAN, the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons, in four of the five countries Col Lee references, suggests otherwise.The publics in these four countries were askedthe US tactical nuclear weapons should be removed and responded in the affirmative as follows: Belgium %, The Netherlands %, Italy % and Germany %. Figures for Turkey are not available.These polls reveal that anti-nuclear sentiment, particularly amongst the original Western European members of Nato is considerable. It is another sign of Scotlandrsquos Western European political cultural alignment in general and that Scottish anti-nuclear sentiment is not some sort of outlier. It is Brexit Britain that is the real outlier.At its August conference the SNP passed a motion by more than  votes to  endorsing the earlier decision of all SNP parliamentarians to sign the ICAN parliamentary pledge that an independent Scotland would swtly sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weaponswhich came into force at the UN in January .The TPNW has  state signatories and so far  states have ratied it, a number that will grow by the time the TPNW has its CoP hosted by the Austrian Government in Vienna in March next year, an event that many of us in the civil society dimension of the anti-nuclear movement hope to attend.Bill Ramsay, Convener, SNP CND, Glasgow.A GOOD COP FOR FIRST MINISTERI ALWAYS enjoy Alison Rowats rapier-sharp wit, but\"Mr B Johnson of London\" has indeed left the comment she imagines, that Glasgow is a \"fab boltholeup to neck in sleaze row\", Mr Johnson, with sleaze now over his head, will find it well-nigh impossible to rise above it, whether in Glasgow or anywhere  . And although hed ditched the plane on histo the climate conference, his arrival as he alighted from the train was greeted with less than enthusiasm from the reception committee it wasnt just the gap Boris Johnson had to mind.However, even more of an irritant to Mr Johnson must be the high profile Scotlands First Minister has achieved at the conference. Mr Johnson infamously told the Scottish Tories he didnt want Nicola Sturgeon \"anywhere near it\", although he had to do a U-turn on that, given that Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of the country where the conference is taking place. Then there was the Tory MP alleging that the three objectives at COP were \"Save the planet. Save the country. And stop Sturgeon getting a photo with Biden\". That one didnt go well for Mr Johnson either.As for the overall verdict on the conference, Ms Rowat is right to sum it up as \"jury out\". But whether it has been a good COP, a bad COP, or a Cop-out, only time will tell.

Online learning will be offered to affected pupils.According to a statement released by OIC, this evening, the situation will remain under daily review andthe position changes, parents and staff will be updated.The remainder of classes at Papdale Primary School will be open on Monday as usual.James Wylie, OIC’s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “Staff have been working tirelessly over the last week to try and ensure Papdale Primary and Nursery were able to remain open in full, however, this has now reached the point where it is simply no longer possible. There are several factors for this including staff reporting positive PCR test results, being contact traced by Public Health, and the supply teaching staff list having been exhausted.“We realise that this may cause childcare issues for working parents and that is partly why we will keep the closures to an absolute minimum and monitor and manage the situation on a daily basis, ensuring that the settings are able to reopen once it is safe to do so with the appropriate staffing levels in place. It is also vital that we keep our educational facilities open whenever possible for the learning of our children, who have already missed out on so much these past  months of the pandemic.“I, again, take this opportunity to thank our staff, parents and pupils for the way in which we all continue to manage these situations, which are challenging for everyone.

These are PM, PE and PE and PM.Papdale Nursery is also closed in full until the same date due to all staff having been contact traced.Authorities have said that the situation is being kept under constant review by NHS Orkney Public Health and OIC and daily updates are being provided to parents, staff and the wider community via the head teachers and communications on the council website and social media, and local media outlets.Online learning to those pupils having to remain at home is being provided by the school.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The situation at Papdale is changing at pace and I must commend the Head Teacher and her staff for doing all they can to ensure learning continues for pupils whether that is in class or remotely during these extenuating circumstances. My same thanks must go to the Nursery manager and colleagues for also going the extra mile to work through the challenges.“Orkney has been very lucky up to this stage with comparatively low numbers of COVID-, however we are all now facing a very dferent picture – the waves which have hit other areas are now on our shores. I must also praise parents who have, on the whole, been very supportive of the staff at Papdale and recognise the tremendous efforts they have been putting in to try and follow the Public Health guidance and ensure the most appropriate and safe plans are in place.“As already said, we continue to meet with Public Health, Environmental Health, Safety and Resilience and Education staff to evaluate the present situation to influence the next steps. As a result of staffing issues due to COVID we have no alternative but to keep the P classes closed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. We will update all parents as soon as possiblethis position changes and further closures are required.“We do understand that there are dfering opinions on this some parents are anxious about sending their child to school where there have been positive cases and there are others who feel that given the enhanced mitigating measures in place, that routines and learning should continue whenever possible.  What we must do as educators is look to the advice and guidance of Public Health and collectively, in a multi-agency way, find the balance.“I joined an Environmental Health colleague from the Council, along with the Head Teacher,  this morningon a walk through the school to evaluate the mitigations in place. For all those that may be concerned Environmental Health are confident that appropriate measures are being taken.“There is no doubt that the virus is not going to disappear in the near future so we must adapt as best we can. Our children deserve an education and that is what we will strive to provide. Please continue to follow the guidance which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney.”NHS Orkney say around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority has emphasised that it’s more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow.Recording both positive and negative results allows the NHS to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, which include a continuous cough, temperature and loss in taste or smell, or you have a positive Lateral Flow testyou MUST self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test by calling  .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A further four staff are awaiting PCR tests or results. In total,  Papdale staff are off work today due to illness or other reasons.A total of  pupils remain within class today, and a further  are receiving online learning, out of a school roll of . The remainder —  pupils — are absent from school for a iety of reasons, including COVID, other illness, or due to parental concerns.James Wylie, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “It is unfortunate that we remain in the position today that we cannot safely reopen the four classes mentioned for the remainder of the school week due to COVID-related staffing shortages and the continuous slight rise in pupil cases across these classes.#It is important that this messaging is conveyed to parents as soon as possible in respect of the remainder of the school week to allow them the time to make appropriate childcare arrangements.“Head Teacher Wendy Bowen will be contacting parents now to make them aware of the decision and Nursery Manager Caroline Easton will also be updating those who use the nursery facility. We are continuing to hold daily meetings andthe position changes we will update accordingly.“As always, I thank staff for their hard work in trying to manage this situation and parents for their understanding.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

A support scheme is to be set up amid fears that the price rises will lead to an increase of people living in fuel poverty. The rise will take effect from December ,  and affects firmus customers in Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Derry Londonderry, Newry and more than  other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. firmus say wholesale global gas prices have increased by % from a year ago and by % since the previous tarf review that came into effect on the st October. The change in tarf means an extra pound. per week on to the average household bill. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. This is a not a firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect. If any of our customers feel that they require further support, they should contact us directly to see how we can help.

Credit: PAPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAustin Currie. Credit: PANovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAustin Currie was a good friend of mine since we were honours history students together at Queen’s University in the early Sixties.Austin, like me, came from a working background, and the opportunity to earn a degree opened a door to careers which were not possible to previous generations from the rural outposts like Tyrone and south Armagh.Austin from the very start had great personal charm and a warm friendliness. We came from nationalist and unionist communities, but these dferences did not matter in those innocent days when it seemed that the violence which had plagued the province in the s would never . How wrong we were.In our small history tutorials at Queen’s, Austin was never lost for a word, but like me he could have done more homework. I recall one session on American history when the tutor asked him to speak about the economic decline of the West Indian sugar plantations.Instead, Austin launched into an eloquent dissertation about the Irish potato famine, until the tutor interrupted him and said, “You are not answering my question”, to which Austin replied: “I am answering my own question.” I thought even then that Currie had some of the right qualications to be a politician. After Queen’s we went our separate ways — he to politics, and me to journalism — but we never lost respect or regard for one another. I admired his integrity, his courage and his vision as he fought for justice. He trod a dficult and sometimes dangerous path, but he was totally supported by his lovely we Annita who had great courage also, and by their beloved children.Austin’s civil rights and political trail-blazing has been somewhat underestimated in the shadow of John Hume and others, but he was a political Titan in his own right.Signicantly the heartfelt tributes have come from across the political and community ide, and notably from the Church of Ireland Primate Archbishop John McDowell, who shrewdly pointed out that “his whole political career was founded on a desire for justice and peace... his contribution deserves as an example to be remembered”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Austin Currie was a credit to his old university and his tutors, to his family and friends, and to his native province, people and island.

It’s therefore disappointing, but not a surprise, that no one from the DUP attended the research network launch.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThousands take part in climate action protests across island of Ireland“In his unambitious proposals for cutting emissions in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots has failed to recognise the importance of all-island policy to tackling the climate crisis.“But I look forward to the new research network providing input into the development of ambitious all-island environmental policy.“As political leaders and legislators, we all have a responsibility to listen to experts and the science.”The DUP said the party remains “supportive of all efforts to combat climate change”.“The First Minister was involved in meetings on issues including mother and baby homes,” the party said over the non-involvement of Paul Givan at the launch.“In Glasgow, he had the opportunity to engage in climate discussions with the other UK nations and many international delegates, including academics from a range of countries round the world.”The All-Island Climate and Bioersity Research Networkhas been hailed as a breakthrough project between institutions north and south of the border and will bring together top academics for the first time to research climate issues.Read More‘Keen environmentalist’ Sammy Wilson brands COP ‘a climate circus’Among the experts involved in the project is Professor Derek Jackson, a coastal geoscientist at Ulster University’s School of Geography and Environmental Sciences, who said there has never been a more critical time to pool resources to tackle what is a common problem faced across the country.“Our shared environment is facing unprecedented pressures and the only realistic way of addressing the resulting impacts is to assess issues through joint approaches and mitigation. This network is a sensible conduit through which we can achieve this,” he said.“No single institution, discipline or project can solve these highly complex challenges alone. It is only by working together across institutions, disciplines and jurisdictions that we can collectively deliver the solutions required.”Ms O’Neill said the climate emergency needs shared action.“Across the island, we are facing in to a bioersity crisis. This is a shared challenge and it calls for shared action,” she said.“For us in government, that means taking the action needed at policy level to implement the measures that will help to achieve our shared goals and working in partnership with organisations and experts at an operational level to address these challenges and bring about positive change.”Sinn Fein environmental spokesperson Philip McGuigan said the network was the only sensible way forward.“Our is environment is not constrained by political boundaries and our energy and power all come from a single electricity market – working together just makes sense,” he said.“I’m pleased that experts from right across the island will be working together and will help us play a leading role in the fight against climate change.”Related topicsCOPGreen PartySinn FéinQueen’s UniversityUniversity of UlsterMore On COP PremiumNichola Mallon open to congestion charging in NI cities to cut emissionsCop flight a mistake, admits NI-born councillor Phelim Mac CaffertyNorth-south project to bring together top academics from across Ireland for first time to tackle climate issuesNorth-south project to bring together top academics from across Ireland for first time to tackle climate issuesPupils from across NI debate climate crisis at StormontMost ReadUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fansVideo: Flaming lorry drives through Coleraine‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideRegister lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workLet’s move on: Ulster chief says BMW Armistice Day PR tweet at war memorial an ‘honest mistake’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Tributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieLatest Northern IrelandLegal challenge on DUP cross-border meetings boycott ‘of some public interest’One in four double-jabbed people in UK likely to have received extra dosePupils create lockdown poetry and photography collectionEamonn Holmes: Top  moments as broadcaster set to leave This MorningDeal with my solicitor: Donaldson threatens legal action over BBC protocol protest claimsLatestElon Musk sells more Tesla shares, but stock drops in early tradingLegal challenge on DUP cross-border meetings boycott ‘of some public interest’Harry faced ‘constant berating’ from royal family, Meghan told aideRobert Page committed to leading Wales amid uncertainty surrounding play-off tieOne in four double-jabbed people in UK likely to have received extra dose,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stock imageAmy CochraneTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAgriculture Minister Edwin Poots has suggested putting masks on cows as a way to reduce the animal’s greenhouse gas output.Cows and other farm animals produce about % of human-induced climate emissions.A UN report released in May earlier this year said swt action to cut methane pollution would rapidly reduce the rate of global warming, while boosting health and food production.Methane, which also comes from sources including fossil fuel extraction, is a short-lived but very potent climate pollutant that is second only to carbon dioxide in driving global warming.It is generally produced when cows belch after eating.Speaking on the BBC’s Nolan Show on Friday morning Minister Poots revealed that Belfast’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute is currently testing a hood which you can place over a cow’s nose to try and stop methane from being released into the atmosphere.He said: “It’s like a scrubber so when the cow emits methane then it catches the methane and then that doesn’t go into the atmosphere.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up When asked where the methane goes instead, he explained that it stays in the mask.“You would fix the hood over the cow’s nose and replace the pads inside every so often,” the Agriculture Minister explained.“We hope that this will do something to help reduce some of the methane produced by the cattle herd across Northern Ireland.”Minister Poots explained that cows have a “complex system of stomachs” and after swallowing grass, it is then regurgitated, chewed, and then distributed into the other stomachs.“It is in this regurgitation process that the cow would burp and release methane,” he said.“What people don’t know is that soil is very rich in carbon, a lot of carbon is sequestered by grass, which takes it out of the atmosphere and it puts it down into the soil, so it is natural thatcow is eating a product which is carbon rich then that is what it releases again.”Most ReadUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fansVideo: Flaming lorry drives through Coleraine‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideRegister lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workLet’s move on: Ulster chief says BMW Armistice Day PR tweet at war memorial an ‘honest mistake’Top VideosPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Tributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieLatest Northern IrelandCommunity Pharmacy chief hits back at claims aired on Good Morning Britain of NI medicine shortages‘Serious headway’ needed in the next week over Northern Ireland protocol – EULegal challenge on DUP cross-border meetings boycott ‘of some public interest’One in four double-jabbed people in UK likely to have received extra dosePupils create lockdown poetry and photography collectionLatestCommunity Pharmacy chief hits back at claims aired on Good Morning Britain of NI medicine shortagesTaoiseach: We are considering advice on orderingto working from homeSleaze allegations will not hit Tories in by-elections, says PM‘Serious headway’ needed in the next week over Northern Ireland protocol – EUElon Musk sells more Tesla shares, but stock drops in early trading,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

About , customers in the area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry, will see price hikes and it’s thought other areas may soon follow suit.Why is this happening Firmus said rising global energy costs had “forced” its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by % in October and by % earlier in the year. Wholesale costs make up % of customers’ gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect when the companies involved say they can’t absorb the cost.How will it affect me The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about £ a year or £ a year for those with a prepayment meter.What has Firmus said Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking to the BBC, Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said this is a challenge being faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity. Sooner or later, they will all have to put up their costs to meet “huge upsurges” in wholesale energy costs, he said. “We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable.”WhatI can’t afford it It’s undoubtedly a dficult time for many consumers with several price increases coming into play this winter. Firmus said it would work with a local charity to introduce a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect.High prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year according to the Utility Regulator — and it’s been warned the volatility could even last for between  to  months.Read MoreHot tips: Five alternative ways to heat your home as winter months close inMost ReadUlster Rugby take down ‘insensitive’ Armistice Day tweet after criticism from fansVideo: Flaming lorry drives through Coleraine‘Disgusting’ Enniskillen war memorial posters condemned across political ideLet’s move on: Ulster chief says BMW Armistice Day PR tweet at war memorial an ‘honest mistake’Register lts lid on BBC NI stars’ lucrative external workTop VideosPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayVideo: Flaming lorry drives through ColerainePlayVideo: Tributes paid at funeral of a ‘true giant of civil rights’ Austin CurrieLatest Northern Ireland‘Non-starter’: Retail chief warns against congestion charges in NI after Nichola Mallon’s commentsCommunity Pharmacy chief hits back at claims aired on Good Morning Britain of NI medicine shortages‘Serious headway’ needed in the next week over Northern Ireland protocol – EULegal challenge on DUP cross-border meetings boycott ‘of some public interest’One in four double-jabbed people in UK likely to have received extra doseLatestCop: Where do dferent countries stand on the final outcome Governors urge review after school dinner debts rowJoris MinneOpinionRestaurant review: Bistro Este, consistency and class in a restaurant that knows where it’s goingThe A Word: why we need to be able to comfortably speak about anxiety‘Non-starter’: Retail chief warns against congestion charges in NI after Nichola Mallon’s comments,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is at best off-colour to post an image like this on Remembrance Day.“It is a time for reflection on the sacrice paid for the freedoms we all enjoy, not sponsorship deals. Using a war memorial as a backdrop was also unwise.”The North Antrim MLA added: “Having said all that, the fact that the tweet was pulled suggests that the error was recognised and hopefully lessons have been learned.”In , Ulster Rugby faced a similar backlash amid allegations of a calculated insult to the war dead.Some fans and politicians were angry poppies were not worn by players during a match in Wales on Remembrance Sunday.

to the Belfast , Glen Dimplex said they are “fully committed to providing a fair rate of pay which is sustainable in a highly competitive sector”.Union reps said it is more than seven months since

similar skilled workers amidst a labour shortage,” she continued.Mr Moore added that the Glen Dimplex bosses “need to recognise thatthis strike proceeds all production at this site will shutdown”.Workers estimate the output on one of four heater production lines in the factory alone is worth £k a day,” he said.Management need to see that the impact on the company’s bottom-line of a prolonged strike will dwarf the costs of paying its workforce fairly,” he said.The company has moved in the past couple of days towards where we want to see in terms of a wage, but this is also about respect.The company is still failing our members in terms of back pay… in terms of their ask for a recognition payment for having to work throughout the pandemic. Our members are requesting that the company... in order to get us to a living wage, to show the workers the respect that they deserve, and pay them a decent amount of back pay and the Covid payments that they deserve, for working throughout the pandemic, keeping this factory profitable and keeping production up throughout the past couple of years.”The company has been approached for comment.A spokesperson for Glen Dimplex added the company “is grateful to the majority of its staff in Portadown for continuing to work as normal towards a consensual and sustainable outcome and appeals to Unite to re-engage in a meaningful manner with the Labour Relations Agency process that commenced earlier this week.“Glen Dimplex current base pay rates already exceed the National Living Wage and as part of the current discussions Glen Dimplex has already offered an increase that would exceed what is known as the real living wage and has addressed both requests for backpay and one-off payments.“In addition to this higher base pay, workers also benefit from an hourly bonus payment further increasing pay levels above the real living wage“Unite members who voted in favour of industrial action account for a

Bernie Friars, Tina McElhinney, Grainne McLaughlin, Lesley Ann Curry and Joyce Logan Wilson, all familiar faces who have worked at the former EUROSPAR and served the local community for decades, were given the honour of cutting the ribbon on the newly built Waterside store. googletag.cmd.push EUROSPAR Rossdowney champions a number of local suppliers in the North West area, from in-store florist Wild Berry Boutique to Higgins  Sons Family Butchers and McDaid’s Bakery with their famous burnt buns. The supermarket has also been developed with the local shoppers’ specic missions in mind – to pick up fresh, local food-to-go for now, and groceries for later. EUROSPAR Rossdowney is also the first home of the new Nourish deli, offering a nutritious selection of bowls, wraps and smoothies throughout the day. The concept has been created by Henderson Retail to offer shoppers even more choice from their popular food-to-go counters. Mark McCammond, retail director at Henderson Group, said the store represented all that was great and good about the local area. He added: “The people of the Waterside area are what makes it, and the local links for the new EUROSPAR Rossdowney store are second to none. “Not only do we have a team that has served the local community for decades, but we also have extensive ranges of products sourced from local suppliers which keep our food miles down. “We have researched the local shopper demographic extensively, so this store has been built with what they’re looking for directly in mind – fresh, locally produced ingredients for tonight’s tea, and on-site options, made fresh in-store for now.” Store manager, Keith Wilson, has been in charge throughout the build, and said the addition of  parking spaces, a two-pump MAXOL forecourt featuring regular grades and new % carbon offset Premium fuel grades, and a host of additional services on site made it the most convenient site in town. He added: “Shoppers can expect a wide range of services in-store including the Post Office and the extended range of products available from the butchery counter, alongside the first ever Nourish deli counter and all-new Barista Bar coffee, now serving flat whites and luxury hot chocolate and all the Barista coffee favourites. “Local is at the heart of everything we do, from our North West supplier roster which features Limavady’s Milgro and Broighter Gold, Derry’s Doherty Meats, Bonds Potatoes and McDaid’s Bakery alongside Coleraine’s Scott’s Crispy Onions and our top-class butchery serve over from Higgins Family Butchers in Castlerock. “We also have The CHEF range of home-cooked, pre-prepared meals which have recently been awarded Great Taste Awards. Our staff are all friendly faces, well-known and trusted in the area and our shoppers know they will be getting the best range, choice and value in-store.”  Bernie Friars, Lesley Ann Curry, Joyce Logan-Wilson, Grainne McLaughlin, Tina McElhinney, who have over  years of EUROSPAR experience between them, declare the all-new EUROSPAR Rossdowney officially open.  Over , big brand products have been price matched to Tesco, bringing even more value at a local level. Keith continued “We were delighted to have Foyle Search and Rescue on site for our opening day where we held bucket collections for the vital work they do locally. Throughout the year, we will raise money for the NI Children’s Hospice, EUROSPAR’s charity partner Cancer Fund for Children, and the Jack  Jill Foundation. Our community outreach work is extremely important we have donated sanitising stations to the local Dale View Nursing Home, and we’ll continue to support the team at Arc Fitness who do important work around mental wellbeing and addiction. “It’s very important for us to be a hub of the local community and we look forward to supporting all these organisations and more in the future.”  Flourish with Nourish The newest food to go offering created for EUROSPAR Nourish is a range of bowls, wraps and smoothies.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Firmus Energy have announced that a . per cent rise to the gas tarf in the Ten Towns Network that will take effect on December ,  – resulting in an extra pound. per week to household bills. googletag.cmd.push Derry is part of the Ten Towns Network that also include Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady and Newry. Firmis have claimed the rise is due the wholesale global gas prices undergoing a massive  per cent hike last year and by  per cent since the previous tarf review that came into effect last month. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of Firmus energy, said: “We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. “This is a not a Firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. “We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. “We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. “The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect. If any of our customers feel that they require further support, they should contact us directly to see how we can help.” Firmus have advised that customers seeking advice on their natural gas bills or direct debit payments should contact Customer Services on:   .

However, it is clear that parking is causing a great deal of disruption for residents, motorists and pedestrians alike. “Residents have complained that some iniduals parking in the area often block the entrance to their driveways, preventing them from leaving their homes. “In addition, this is a long established residential area with a majority of elderly residents health and safety concerns have been raised that the area is completely inaccessible for emergency services during the day. “I’m pleased that steps are now being taken by the department to employ more traffic wardens to the area and that Magee are working to extend parking provision in the area. I have also asked Roads Service to consider implementing additional measures, including double yellow lines.” A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: “Occupancy figures for theCampus car park show that there has only been one day since term began that the University’s car park has been over subscribed. We are aware that some iniduals choose to park irresponsibly in the area, and we have recently advised all staff and students to park legally and considerately and reiterated that parking permits are available to provide them with an affordable means to park conveniently and safely on campus. We have recently increased car parking capacity and we also continue to work closely with the Council, PSNI and local Residents Association and we understand that they are communicating considerate parking messages to the general public who may also park in the area to travel to work.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

More than  universities in the UK were balloted by the University  College Union  with . per cent of Ulster Universitys UCU members voting for strike action. In a separate ballot askingmembers would be in favour of industrial action other than walking out on strike, . per cent of Ulster Universitys union members voted a resounding yes. googletag.cmd.push Queens University in Belfast saw resounding majorities for both ballots as well with the national UK average for all UCU members being . per cent in favour of strike action with . per cent in favour of action other than a walkout. The dispute is over pay and working conditions. The UCU have demanded a national yearly pay rise of pound for all staff as well as an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other casualised contracts and meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads. A date for strike action for the Ulster University campuses at Magee College, Coleraine and Jordanstown has yet to be set as negotiations that may prevent a walkout are expected to take place. Cllr Shaun Harkin said: “University bosses need to take stock of the resounding vote by lecturers and staff for strike action over pay, conditions and pensions. “People Before Profit send our solidarity to lecturers and staff at  universities, including Ulster University and Queens, following their overwhelming declaration for strike action over pay, working conditions and pensions. People Before Profit fully back the UCUs demands. Wages of university staff has fallen  per cent in real terms since . “A recently published report documented a widespread workload and mental health crisis in universities. Nearly a third of staff say they feel emotionally drained from work pressure. “University bosses are acting no dferently from private sector bosses. This is about turning universities and education into factories for profit. A university shouldnt be run like a corporation focused primarily on churning out profit. “Cancellation of classes will be entirely down to the belligerence and arrogance of university bosses and their disregard for workers and students. “Cynical university bosses will look for any opportunity to ide and conquer by pitting students against staff. “It needs to be remembered that university bosses didnt lt a finger to help students or staff during the pandemic. This is why solidarity between lecturers, staff and students is key. “We encourage all students to join and support the newly formed Students Supporting Industrial Action network. Well do everything we can to back the demands of lecturers and staff. “Across every sector of society employers and government are attempting to put the burden of the pandemic onto the shoulders of workers and the least well-off. The most effective way to respond is with people power resistance and solidarity.” UCU general secretary Jo Grady added: “This result is a clear vote of no confidence in the so-called leaders of our universities, with staff telling them in no uncertain terms that they have had enough of pay and working conditions being run into the ground. “UCU members have yet again beaten the Tory anti-union laws. Alongside our pension ballot result, this means we have a big mandate to take strike action, at a time of our choosing. “It is scandalous that university vice-chancellors on overinflated salaries seem to think doing nothing on pay, casualisation and inequality is acceptable in a sector awash with money. “We truly hope that disruption can be avoided, that is what staff and students alike all want. But this is entirely in the gt of employers who simply need to end their attacks on pensions, pay and working conditions and finally demonstrate they value their staff.” Ulster University has been approached for comment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The charity’s stores in in the city will be delighted to receive any good quality toys, in full working order and complete, as well as good quality winter jumpers, coats and other warm clothes and footwear for children, menswear and ladieswear. googletag.cmd.push In addition to pre-loved quality toys, the charity is also keen to receive donations of unused toys and games, which often prove popular in the run up to Christmas when customers are looking for presents at reasonable prices. Unused toiletries that can be used as gts for teenagers are also popular in Barnardo’s shops, as well as the usual clothing and accessory donations that the charity welcomes all year round. Paula Flood, Area Business Manager for Barnardo’s Retail in Northern Ireland said: “With preparations for Christmas getting underway, this is the time of year many people need to make space for new toys and gts, so we are asking them to keep Barnardo’s in mind and donate any of their good quality pre-loved toys, or clothes, to our charity’s shops. “It’s amazing what people unearth when they start looking in the back of cupboards and at the bottom of the toybox. “It’s a great way to clear out any toys or clothes your children and grandchildren no longer play with or wear, as well as any pre-loved clothes you are not wearing. We’re particularly keen to receive any ‘winter woolly’ type items that we can sell over the coming months. “The donated items will help to raise funds for work carried out to support local children and families who need a little bit of extra help. “We’d like to thank all of our customers and donors for their continued support, which really does make a dference to so many local children’s lives.” Any donations will be received at your local Barnardo’s store at their branches in Shipquay Street and Bishops Street, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man told police he had arrived at address on a UFO overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

There can be few arguments that Glen’s maestro is the best footballer in Derry at the present time. googletag.cmd.push His growth into a leader for both club and county, and a player feared and respected in equal measure, has been remarkable. In the final two years ago, McFaul had the ball in his hands as John Joe Cleary blew the final whistle and Magherafelt celebrated beating the Watty’s by the finest of margins. On Sunday evening, McFaul stood on the Celtic Park turf with a very dferent emotion. The demons had been put to bed. A first championship was here. A dream realised. “It’s unbelievable. I remember speaking to you when we beat Slaughtneil in Owenbeg two years ago. I believed we were going to win it that year and we didn’t, we slipped up,” he said. “From that day I had nightmares. It lived with me until we heard that final whistle there and all I can say is what a feeling this is.” Malachy O’Rourke’s men were relentless and ruthless on their way to this year’s showpiece but coming up against neighbours and reigning champions Slaughtneil was always going to be the toughest challenge. “We knew it was going to be a serious battle. You’ve got Paudie Tad, Shane McGuigan, the two McKaigues, Rogers, Patsy – all them boys,” he said. “They have come down the road. We hadn’t been down that road, we hadn’t gotten over the line in a final, and we knew it was going to be a   game, but our talent shone through.  “There’s serious drive in that team. We knew we had done the work with Malachy. Other years we probably peaked too early in the league. “Malachy and Ryancame in and told us we were going to peak in October November and we did just that. We showed our class today. “We deserve it. From we were under ’s, the likes of Enda and Rooster and all them boys believed in us. We knew we had the talent, and we knew it was about sticking together. “I know a boy from Tyrone that said ‘where has this Glen minor team gone ’ but we showed today that we haven’t gone away.” St Eunan’s of Donegal will await in the preliminary round of the Ulster senior club championship. That game won’t be quite on the mind yet as the celebrations continue, but for McFaul the challenge is a welcome one. “We have nothing to lose with Ulster. Some people might say we’re favourites, but we have no right to be favourites,” he said. “On our performance today I think we probably need a wee bit more to get over the line in Ulster, but we’ll worry about that when it comes.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

Speaking after Sunday’s decider in Celtic Park, midfielder Emmett Bradley also stressed there their focus lay. Their motivation came from within. It was always about the next game, and striving for a better performance. googletag.cmd.push Since coming on the senior club scene ’ or ’ years ago, Bradley remembers the narrative. Could they translate their underage promise into the biggest prize of all  Sunday was their answer. A big fat yes. “We had to work incredibly hard,” said Bradley of their journey. “We knew were up against it and especially today, with Slaughtneil being the dominant force in years. “AsCarville said in the speech, we were just trying to replicate them. They drove us on to keep working and keep chipping away.” The John McLaughlin and Seamus McFerran Cups passed through Maghera on those autumn Sunday nights, on their way to Slaughtneil. Now it’s Glen’s turn.  Hours after speaking to the County Derry Post, Bradley was one of entire senior and reserve squad that was paraded through Maghera main street in the back of goalkeeping coach Pearse McCallan’s lorry. Memories that will last a letime. Bradley hails the squad and how they shirked off any doubt their moment in the limelight would appear. Malachy O’Rourke and Ryan Porters get a generous namecheck for adding ‘a lot’ to Glen’s snowballing juggernaut. The players accepted any challenge put at their feet. Training was hard, yet smart. Every game was taken on its merits and as momentum spiralled to the steps of Celtic Park’s Tommy Mellon stand, Glen shot their way towards a . point average winning game across seven games. “Theboys worked really hard in terms of keeping themselves right. There were very few injuries throughout the year and that meant an awful lot.” “One thing I noticed this year was that the entire team bought in. “Whatever the team needed, anybody was willing to do whatever that was needed to get over the line. “It was fitting that it was Slaughtneil that we beat. As I said, they have been the benchmark.

For Malachy O’Rourke, the feeling of winning silverware isn’t quite as foreign. When he took the Glen managerial post, there was only one target in his mind – to repeat the feat he managed  years previous with The Loup. googletag.cmd.push He inherited a side that knew they were close but were reeling from a  final defeat against Magherafelt and then a quarter-final exit last year at the hands of the eventual champions, Slaughtneil. The only word for their campaign leading to Sunday was dominance. But this one was the acid test. Were they now ready to make that last step  “The boys put in serious hard work from the start of the year, and I suppose we all dreamt of a day like this that we could get over the line,” said the former Monaghan manager. “When you see how much it means to so many people, it’s a great feeling. We worked hard all year and the boys really put their shoulder to the wheel. “They were determined thatthey got the chance again that they were going to grab it, and I suppose that’s what they did.” As the championship ticked on, O’Rourke’s men only became more scintillating, free-flowing and relentless. A - to - semi-final victory over The Loup sent the loudest of warning signs. They were gearing up for a battle. “We felt that the boys were going well. They were training hard and they were really focused,” he explained.  “We had a good win in the semi-final but we always felt that there was more and we knew we would have to have more because of the tremendous experience that Slaughtneil have and their ability to win games. We knew we had to put in a big performance. “We started the game very well and I suppose we never let go of that stranglehold we got at the start. It was a great performance and I’m delighted to get through it.” The men in green and gold looked sharp from the get go, holding Slaughtneil to just one point in the opening half. Leading - to - ticking into the final seconds before the break, a lovely move involving Tiarnan Flanagan and Conor Glass was finished off by Danny Tallon to the net. It was the ultimate sucker punch. “Our display in the first half maybe merited being another couple of points in front, but we kicked a couple of wides so that goal gave us that buffer that was crucial at half-time. “I suppose it meant thatwe just kept our heads in the second half and played controlled football then it was always going to be hard for them to get back into it, and that’s how it turned out.” For Glen it may turn out that county championships are like buses – you wait so long for one then suddenly many come along. The age profile of this team and the frightening levels of talent would certainly indicate it. But for their manager, there’s no complacency, be it the upcoming Ulster campaign or the years to come. “Derry football is very strong and you can never look too far ahead. I’m just delighted to get through today and delighted to get the first championship for the club. “A lot will depend on the next couple of weeks and how the boys get on. We’ll not be putting any handbrake on them for the immediate future – we’ll let them enjoy it because that’s a big part of football as well. “We’ll assess things at the end of the week and see how we’re going, but we’ll enjoy this one.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

For Malachy O’Rourke, the feeling of winning silverware isn’t quite as foreign. When he took the Glen managerial post, there was only one target in his mind – to repeat the feat he managed  years previous with The Loup. googletag.cmd.push He inherited a side that knew they were close but were reeling from a  final defeat against Magherafelt and then a quarter-final exit last year at the hands of the eventual champions, Slaughtneil. The only word for their campaign leading to Sunday was dominance. But this one was the acid test. Were they now ready to make that last step  “The boys put in serious hard work from the start of the year, and I suppose we all dreamt of a day like this that we could get over the line,” said the former Monaghan manager. “When you see how much it means to so many people, it’s a great feeling. We worked hard all year and the boys really put their shoulder to the wheel. “They were determined thatthey got the chance again that they were going to grab it, and I suppose that’s what they did.” As the championship ticked on, O’Rourke’s men only became more scintillating, free-flowing and relentless. A - to - semi-final victory over The Loup sent the loudest of warning signs. They were gearing up for a battle. “We felt that the boys were going well. They were training hard and they were really focused,” he explained.  “We had a good win in the semi-final but we always felt that there was more and we knew we would have to have more because of the tremendous experience that Slaughtneil have and their ability to win games. We knew we had to put in a big performance. “We started the game very well and I suppose we never let go of that stranglehold we got at the start. It was a great performance and I’m delighted to get through it.” The men in green and gold looked sharp from the get go, holding Slaughtneil to just one point in the opening half. Leading - to - ticking into the final seconds before the break, a lovely move involving Tiarnan Flanagan and Conor Glass was finished off by Danny Tallon to the net. It was the ultimate sucker punch. “Our display in the first half maybe merited being another couple of points in front, but we kicked a couple of wides so that goal gave us that buffer that was crucial at half-time. “I suppose it meant thatwe just kept our heads in the second half and played controlled football then it was always going to be hard for them to get back into it, and that’s how it turned out.” For Glen it may turn out that county championships are like buses – you wait so long for one then suddenly many come along. The age profile of this team and the frightening levels of talent would certainly indicate it. But for their manager, there’s no complacency, be it the upcoming Ulster campaign or the years to come. “Derry football is very strong and you can never look too far ahead. I’m just delighted to get through today and delighted to get the first championship for the club. “A lot will depend on the next couple of weeks and how the boys get on. We’ll not be putting any handbrake on them for the immediate future – we’ll let them enjoy it because that’s a big part of football as well. “We’ll assess things at the end of the week and see how we’re going, but we’ll enjoy this one.”  WATCH: County Derry primary school opens new pitch as parish prepares for county final  St Mary’s PS Glenview has a number of past pupils involved in Slaughtneil v Glen.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Here are  to choose from....enjoy! Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. googletag.cmd.push Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Work started last week on the new facility which is being provided at the grounds of the local gaelic club.The scheme is a joint initiative by the Saul club and Down Council and work is expected to be completed within the new few weeks.The arrival of the contractors on site late Thursday morning marked the end of a long campaign by local councillor Mr Peter Craig.He is delighted work is underway and has no doubt the playground will make a major contribution to the lives of young people in the area.He said the gaelic clubrsquos premises are being used to house the playground because no other suitable sites could be identied in the area.And in a bid to further improve safety standards, Roads Service officials are to provide new lighting along a footpath which runs from Raholp to the GAA pitch.BALLYNAHINCH mdashA senior police officer has rejected claims from a Sinn Fein councillor that a police car sped away from a Catholic couple who had been attacked in Ballynahinch at the weekend.Inspector Paul McClean has refuted Francis Brannfrsquos allegations that police allowed the assailants to escape after attacking the couple in fast food premises at High Street in the early hours of Sunday.Inspector McClean has also rejected Cllr Brannfrsquos allegations that the injured couple were questioned by an officer from a mobile support unit while their attackers were ldquoallowed to escape.Alleging that the Catholic couple were ldquoviciously beaten, Mr Brannf said that after being head butted and ldquobeaten to the ground the woman ran to a nearby police car to get help while her husband was being assaulted.He also said police allowed ldquothe Loyalists to escape the scene of yet another sectarian attack on nationalists in Ballynahinch.NEWCASTLE mdash Two Stormont departments are at loggerheads after Newcastle beach failed a series of water quality tests.Department of the Environment experts failed Newcastle beach because the level of sewage contamination found in the bathing waters was a breach of European guidelines.But the Department of Regional Development, responsible for sewage treatment, has rejected the DoErsquos reasons, claiming other factors are to blame.Only three out of  Northern Ireland beaches failed the quality tests which must be passedbeaches are to be considered for the prestigious Blue Flag quality award. Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community. There have been some episodes recently where children have been running through gardens and hedges at homes of elderly people.ldquoI would ask them to give these members of the community the peace and space they deserve and consider their feelings in pursuit of fun, he said.BALLYKINLAR mdash Ballykinlar cross-community playgroup has been strongly praised by education inspectors for providing a positive ethos which promotes childrenrsquos confidence and self-esteem.The Department of Education report lists a number of strengths of the playgroup which operates out of the old school on the Carricknab Road.Staff are headily praised for their leadership and dedication to the children and the inspectors found there were only a few areas which need attention.ldquoThe staff treat the children with care and respect and provide a secure, supportive environment which helps the children grow in confidence and independence, said the report.SAINTFIELD mdash The achievements and success of the younger pupils at Saintfield High School were cerebrated during a special junior school prize day last week.The principal, Mr Robert Miss, said the school prided itself on being a family school offering support, interest and encouragement in all the pupils strive to achieve.Mr Mills proudly pointed out that the schoolrsquos well established year eight induction programme seeks to ensure that all new pupils entering Saintfield High School settle quickly into their new environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_stpatrickday.jpg","title":"Green light for St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"A ST Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is scheduled to go ahead next year.The Recorder can confirm that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is pressing ahead with plans for the event which regularly attracts thousands of visitors to the town.The cross-community spectacular was last held in , with last yearrsquos event one of the districtrsquos first high profile casualties of the emerging coronavirus pandemic.The parade was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions to help prevent the spread of the deadly virus, but council officials are confident the event can go ahead next March.With Covid restrictions now eased, they are keen to see the  parade take place with details surprisingly unveiled to councillors in private during Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.As the public health emergency has eased slightly, a number of councillors believe that as the parade is an outdoor event, it will be able to proceed, provided people continue to exercise caution.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, said while there are over four months to go before the parade would be held, ious plans have to be put in place.He said decisions have to be taken now to ensure that all the pieces in the eventrsquos jigsaw are in place and believes that the current environment allows for the popular event to proceed.ldquoPublic health advice rightly prompted the decision to cancel the last two St Patrickrsquos Day parades but the situation has changed.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo.

She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes.

Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -.

The route around Newry was a twisting single carriageway with a high fatality rate, and the dual carriageway sections had deadly gap junctions, in which cars have to cross the central reservation amid fast oncoming traffic to make a right turn.Much of that basic dual carriageway remains in place today.The infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has approved an upgrade scheme that will replace most of the A gap junctions with flyovers. This is welcome, but it has been a tortuously slow process, with construction not even under way some  years after the southern motorway reached the border.Part of the problem is that the Irish authorities used tolls to help fund their world-class motorways, whereas populist Stormont politicians are almost always reluctant to ask the public to help pay for services.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySetting off downhill to pick up another walker by the Custom House, they followed a narrow track to join the foreshore where they slithered across wet pebbles and seaweed to locate soft sinking sand on the journey below Penarth Head towards Penarth Pier which appeared rather eerily on the darkened skyline ahead.Joining pavements near the pier, a short climb up Bridgeman Road led them into the delightful Windsor Gardens, past the old bandstand and onward to cross Clf Hill and along the clf walk, where a number of other people were out enjoying the fresh air. The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

A support scheme is to be set up amid fears that the price rises will lead to an increase of people living in fuel poverty. The rise will take effect from December ,  and affects firmus customers in Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Derry Londonderry, Newry and more than  other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. firmus say wholesale global gas prices have increased by % from a year ago and by % since the previous tarf review that came into effect on the st October. The change in tarf means an extra pound. per week on to the average household bill. Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand. This is a not a firmus issue, but a challenge faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity all of whom, sooner or later, will have to further increase their prices to meet the huge upsurges which have taken place in wholesale energy costs. We know this is an unwelcome increase which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable. We have been consulting with key stakeholders and will be introducing a support scheme to be delivered through a local charity which will offer targeted help to those most in need, especially over the winter period. The scheme will be launched in the coming weeks and will go live around the same time as the increase we announced today takes effect. If any of our customers feel that they require further support, they should contact us directly to see how we can help.
