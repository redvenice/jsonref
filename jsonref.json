He took it up when he was forced to give up polo in 1971 due to an arthritic wrist.

After they were rescued and safely in the back of a Land Rover, the Duke simply turned to him and quipped, \u0027See what I mean?\u0027\u0027I\u0027ve seen him do it and it looks terrifying but his former private secretary says it\u0027s relaxation for him.\u0027If you\u0027re doing it at speed and going around obstacles, you have to concentrate so hard you don\u0027t have time to think about anything else.

Dickens\u0027 character Fagin may have been inspired by Robert Mudie\u0027s descriptions of a gang-leader \u0027 of the Israelitish cast\u0027 that he wrote about in his book, London and Londoners The youngster mirrors the character of the Artful Dodger who, in the 1837 novel, enlists Oliver and introduces him to Fagin before moving him in with the gang of young thieves in Saffron Hill.The information came to light after The Times archive editor Rose Wild discovered the article in the newspapers\u0027 records.   Tomalin said: \u0027It\u0027s very striking, and could certainly have given Dickens ideas for Oliver Twist.\u0027He was planning a novel which was almost certainly Oliver Twist as early as December 1833. Clearly he visited the courts, and he may well have read law reports in The Times.\u0027 During the 19th century,  London was experiencing a slowly burgeoning immigrant population, with groups of black soldiers and seaman being displaced after the Napoleonic wars and settling in London.These settlers suffered prejudice along with many challenges, as did many native black Londoners who would often be branded criminals, uneducated and uncouth.     Twist in the tale: how Dickens found his Fagin in words of a crusading Scot | Books | The Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e92b2c75d65ea32e6c870852045707632d41943e/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=899d5a0e37efa1f4aa035b9e0ee5d0fb","title":"banksy nativity with bullet hole in place of star unveiled in bethlehem","story":"Scar of Bethlehem designed to make people think about how Palestinians live in ided cityBanksy’s latest piece – the artist’s take on a nativity scene – has been unveiled at a hotel in Bethlehem.The Scar of Bethlehem features a nativity scene with Mary and Joseph and the baby Jesus, but instead of a star hanging over the crib there is what appears to be a large bullet hole piercing an imposing grey wall.The piece has appeared in the Walled Off Hotel, Banksy’s property that overlooks the border wall in the ided city. Opened two years ago, the hotel is billed as having “the worst view of any hotel in the world” and is filled with original Banksy artwork.“Love” and “peace” are respectively graffiti-tagged in English and French on the installation’s concrete blocks, while three large wrapped presents are at the forefront of the scene.“It is a nativity,” the hotel’s manager, Wissam Salsaa, said after the piece was installed. “Banksy has his own contribution to Christmas.”“It is a great way to bring up the story of Bethlehem, the Christmas story, in a different way – to make people think more” of how Palestinians live in Bethlehem.The highlight of the hotel is room No 3, known as “Banksy‘s Room”, where guests sleep in a king-size bed underneath a Banksy artwork showing a Palestinian and an Israeli having a pillow fight.Israel began building the separation barrier – in parts concrete, with other stretches consisting of fencing – in 2002 during the Palestinian uprising, or intifada.Built mostly inside the West Bank, Israel says the wall is necessary to prevent attacks, but Palestinians say it separates them from Jerusalem.Banksy is known for making political statements with his graffiti, and has made previous forays into the Palestinian territories.In one secret visit, he drew a girl being pulled upwards by balloons on the iding wall, and he is believed to have entered Gaza to draw four street murals, including one on a metal door that depicted the Greek goddess Niobe cowering against the rubble of a destroyed house.The identity of the world’s best-known graffiti artist remains a mystery and he was not present during the revealing of his latest work.“Banksy is trying to be a voice for those that cannot speak,” Salsaa said, adding that he was “creating a new model of resistance through art”.More traditional Bethlehem Christmas festivities will take place next week at the church built on the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca0be7a5be16dae71c09dbcaa3be3a7e27d17bd/444_744_5206_3124/master/5206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=675e20246575c759cff8719e5acd0bb4","title":"the big picture neil libbert harlem new york 1960","story":"A blizzard hit New York in December 1960, closing schools and businesses. Wandering the streets of Harlem, 22-year-old photographer Neil Libbert noticed a group of kids playing in the snow and began shooting. It wasn’t long before they spotted him and turned the tables, in time-honoured fashion.Documenting the street games of children was a staple for many leading British photojournalists in the late 1940s, 50s and 60s. In a less wary era, kids played out, often unaccompanied by adults, and their chaotic exuberance made great pictures.Memorable work was produced by Picture Post photographers Thurston Hopkins and Bert Hardy, street photographer Roger Mayne – who, in 1961, illustrated the Observer’s Review section cover feature titled “The private world of children’s games” – and of course the great Salford-born documentarian Shirley Baker.Another native of Salford, Libbert also honed his powers of observation and his clandestine approach to his subjects on the backstreets of Manchester in the late 50s, photographing street games, the down-at-heel and life in the snickets. His admiration for American social documentary photographers Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange informed his striking images, and his work opened the door to the Manchester , which he joined first as a freelancer, then on staff.In 1960, Libbert persuaded the paper’s features editor, Brian Redhead (later a Today programme presenter), to give him a grant to help him get to the US. In America, he took some portraits for the paper, but would spend most of his time as “a stranger on strange streets, meeting strangers”, camera in hand. This is archetypal Libbert: a witness in the background waiting to “pounce on that unguarded moment, because once people are aware, they pose”. Eye contact is a rarity – until he meets his match.In Harlem, Libbert’s stealth couldn’t save him. Earlier frames in the sequence (three of which were published in the  on 21 January 1961) show the kids playing, unaware of the photographer’s presence, but that didn’t last long. Once they rumbled him, kids do what kids do, be that in 1960 or 2019, their aim as true as that of Libbert’s Leica."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/216d02627020ec7006b639896bb66af7b0825f76/0_447_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a677f27a650b04dfb02627faed1bfe7","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Anti-government protests in Santiago, the impeachment of US president Donald Trump, a girl power music festival in Buenos Aires – the best photography in news, culture and sport from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c40338c936322ce12af66eb722951821821cef/160_272_2373_1424/master/2373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816ab557855012992144d534e38d181d","title":"amazing mazes cities puzzles in pictures","story":"New York-based artist Sean C Jackson has been creating colourful mazes since he was 10.

They have become the basis for popular films, television dramas and a much-loved musical.But now a PhD student has identified a previously unknown source of inspiration for several of the most affecting elements in the novel, including the notorious underground world of Fagin, the seedy leader of a troop of young pickpockets.Those passages, according to Eva-Charlotta Mebius, a Swedish student of literature at University College London, bear a strong resemblance to factual reports written by a crusading Scottish journalist 35 years Dickens’s senior: Robert Mudie. The two men shared a social cause: to shed light on the miserable lives of poor children in the city of London.Mebius said the seeds of Oliver’s story were sown by a book that lay on Dickens’s shelf at the time of his death and had come out the year before his Twist was first serialised – Mudie’s London and Londoners of 1836.“When I found the passages I was, of course, incredibly excited,” Mebius, originally from Stockholm, told the Observer. “I knew I would have to do a lot of work to connect Mudie with Dickens, but there were just so many similarities, both biographical and literary. The evidence for a connection just became stronger and stronger as I found out more and more about Mudie’s life and career in London.”Experts, including Dickens’s biographer, Michael Slater, have been struck by Mebius’s discovery. “It would appear very strange indeed if Dickens was not familiar with this,” Slater told the Observer, adding he had never seen the connection between the writers made before.The academic and Dickens scholar Professor Malcolm Andrews added that, while there is no firm proof, the similarities Mebius has spotted “between Dickens and Mudie in their detailed descriptions of London crime and poverty are very striking indeed, and it wouldn’t surprise me if evidence came to light that Dickens had indeed drawn on Mudie”.Mebius, 30, lays out her argument in an essay for The Dickensian, the journal of The International Dickens Fellowship, edited by Andrews. In it, she describes finding proof that Dickens had once owned the book, and then highlights the key resonant passages of Mudie’s writing. The powerful moment when Dickens’s pompous character Mr Bumble, the parish beadle, leads tiny Oliver through the streets, like an object for sale, must surely have derived from Mudie, Mebius argues. In Mudie’s book a zealous official “Dogberry” figure, rather than a Bumble, “lays his giant gripe upon the child of six years old, and leads him through the village as ‘my prisoner’, flourishing his cudgel of office, and shouting his ‘Io triumphe!’ as he waddles, and most likely hiccups, along.”The even better-known depiction of Fagin’s hidden den of young thieves, first printed in an episode of Oliver Twist in Bentley’s Miscellany, also seems to have its roots in Mudie’s journalism.The Scotsman recounts the visit of a friend to a den, or “flash house”, down “unpaved” back lanes “covered with mud and mire”. It is a place, entered only by password, where thieves “revel in safety, and ide and occasionally sell their plunder”, and where youngsters are ruled with despotism by “a fence” who can report them to the police at any point.Rather than Fagin, we meet a Captain J, who is “under middle age and middle stature, with features somewhat of the Israelitish cast, but prepossessing and had he been met with in any other place, his manner, and the polite courtesy with which he received his guests, were calculated to inspire any confidence. He was genteelly dressed in black his apartment was handsomely furnished on the table there was a bottle of wine, with which he had been regaling himself and the newspapers of the day, the Hue and Cry, and sundry hand-bills of ‘lost’ watches, pocket-books, and other articles, were beside him for intellectual edification.”Mudie’s description is particularly persuasive for Andrews: “The access to the thieves’ London lair through a maze of streets, the password exchanged through a door hatch, the dark corridor, the arrival to find a room full of thieves, the gang-leader with a demeanour of wily courtesy, and so on all these details (and more) in Mudie’s account are mirrored in Oliver’s experiences.”Final confirmation of the likelihood of the source material for Twist came for Mebius when she checked the lists of the contents of Dickens’s libraries.“I was absolutely thrilled when I finally found the 1836 edition of Mudie’s work in Stonehouse’s Catalogue of the Library of Charles Dickens from Gads Hill,” she said this weekend. “It was not listed under Mudie’s name, so I had to go over it a couple of times before I finally found it.” Her hope now is to find Dickens’s own copy of the book, sold in 1870."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457d25c6fb6cf019851a210d81573523510b1d7d/0_342_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66876afea8a51327dc676194c342923d","title":"shirley hughes my mum dogger christmas ed vulliamy","story":"At 92, Shirley Hughes has written a Christmas sequel to her enduring tale of a lost toy. Her son, who is the real Dogger’s owner, tells all…Most mornings, when in London, I climb the stairs of the house where I grew up during the 1950s and 60s to what was my bedroom, now my mother’s studio – and there she is, at the drawing board, aged 92.The woman that countless grandparents, parents and children call Shirley Hughes and Philip Pullman calls “a national treasure”, I have the honour of calling Mum.The view beyond the winter branches has changed: cranes over White City, and Grenfell Tower. But the porcelain palettes of carefully mixed colours, and the design on silver tubes of Winsor \u0026amp Newton paint, are as they were when I was a child and Mum would write and illustrate her children’s books, listening to the Beatles, Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf.Sixty years later the task in hand these past months has been quite something: Dogger’s Christmas. It’s a sort of remake of Mum’s best loved and most successful book, Dogger, about a boy, Dave, who loses the cuddly toy on which he feels his life depends, the ensuing trauma – and resolution.It feels a bit like a greatest hits album. Mum has done other books for this season of the year: Lucy and Tom’s Christmas, one of her earliest, and Alfie’s Christmas, featuring her longest-running character. But she has never before infused Christmas Day with that unlikely superhero, a stuffed toy dog cuddled with such intensity that his fur has worn off.Last March, Mum had a fall and it was a worrying time. I can’t say I was surprised at her recovery, but Dogger’s Christmas, announced by Penguin Random House last week, will be, among other things, testimony to Mum’s resilience of body and spirit. “I have to get back to work,” she would say. So back to the studio: “My publisher said they wanted another Christmas book, and what better offering to my readers than a Dogger drama on the big day?”The original Dogger was published in 1977. Dave mislays his companion and is distraught, only to find Dogger on sale at a school fete for 5p. By the time Dave finds his family, it is too late – Dogger is sold. But his athletic sister Bella wins a prize – a huge teddy bear – with which she duly entices Dogger back from his new owner.The book has origins in two true stories. Mum recalls the first: “My mother, a widow, did not drive, and we were being taken in a taxi – a converted hearse – by a man called Eric Barrington from the Wirral for holidays at Llandudno Junction. The window was ajar and for some reason I threw my koala bear, Oscar, out of it. I have no idea why. Not for miles did I raise the alarm. When I did, we went back, Mother and Mr Barrington searching the roadside to no avail.”Then the second: the afternoon I left my indispensably favourite teddy bear in then-tatty Holland Park. “It was just awful: Dad going down there with a torch, climbing in, searching – we never found the bear you didn’t sleep for ages.”Dogger really exists. I was given him for Christmas 1959 (I think) by my Irish great-uncle, Hugh Hynes, a general practitioner. Says Mum now: “Little did Uncle Hugh know …”She made Dogger the hero of her adapted tale, giving these cruel real-life narratives a fictional happy ending. The book won the 1977 Kate Greenaway prize, the children’s books Oscar, then 40 years later the “Greenaway of Greenaways” – a bit like being the all-time hall-of-famer in the baseball hall of ame – weeks after my father’ death, while Mum was working on another book about a toy lost in this-time-enchanted Holland Park: Jonadab and Rita.“Dogger has become something of a celebrity,” says Mum now. “He was put in a glass box, on tour, at the Ashmolean in Oxford and Liverpool Walker Art Gallery. He has one ear flopped down, as it should be, and another that was cocked up from years of cuddling and has remained that way after 60 years. His eyes are rather far apart, which I think makes him especially endearing. He’s retired from the celeb circuit now, living in a shoebox, only coming out for the occasional photoshoot” – including last week for the Observer.Why did the book do so well? “So many children know that dependence on, and love for, a cuddly toy – and the trauma of losing it. But parents too: all hell lets loose when something like that happens in a child’s life, and no one can sleep.”But there’s also this: “The real story, though, is about Bella, her kindness and self-sacrifice, understanding what’s really important in life: Dave’s old dog and all it means to him, rather than this big, new, shiny bear she’s won. She’s a good sister, and a good human being.”Those who reckon that lightning doesn’t strike twice, think again. Dave is the same age now as he was in 1977, and dammit if Dogger doesn’t go missing again, on Christmas Day.Some might think that part of the appeal in Mum’s books is that life is the way it used to be, or should be – not how it is now. That could be true of Christmas, too. But it’s not as simple as that.Mum is not especially religious, but beneath her books, apparently simple, cuts a riptide which could be described as “christian” with a small “c”. “Christmas in this book is more about family and home than cheap booze and shopping,” she says. “Dave, Bella and Mum go to visit an elderly neighbour who lives alone while – please note! – Dad cooks. It matters a lot that the children know that Christmas is about the baby in the manger, the birth of Jesus and all it stands for. Whether you are Christian or not, there are universal values associated with Christmas.”Yet there’s always stress on the day. “Alfie’s sister, Annie Rose, throws a temper, over-excited there’s a battery lacking.” All this is nothing, however, compared with Dogger, almost forgotten in the bustle, buried under a pile of wrapping paper – then nowhere to be found.Will Bella do it again? Is Dogger gone for good this time? “I’m not telling what happens,” Mum rolls her eyes, “but it’s a close shave.”• Dogger’s Christmas will be published by Penguin Random House in autumn 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46eeb96a7e81e5d9c65d15d212ffbd21aeff77d2/0_792_4222_2532/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a47defa7a1f39a8fd7a395ba3701556","title":"andrea leadsom approves takeover of cobham defence firm by us company","story":"Founding family criticises approval of £4bn deal despite national security concernsThe government has been accused of handing control away after it approved a US private equity firm’s £4bn takeover of the UK defence company Cobham despite national security concerns.The deal had been delayed since mid-2019 after fears were raised that Advent International’s acquisition could undermine the country’s security.Cobham’s founding family criticised the decision, which was announced late on Friday, and said the government had timed it cynically before the Christmas break to avoid scrutiny.Cobham, which is based in Dorset and employs 10,000 staff, is considered a pioneering world leader in air-to-air refuelling technology. It has extensive contracts with the British military and also manufactures electronic warfare and communications systems for military vehicles.Advent’s offer to purchase Cobham was approved by shareholders in August, but delayed in September when the government intervened on national security grounds.On Friday, however, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom – who led the consultation over the deal – gave the go ahead. It came after Advent proposed a series of legal undertakings designed to mitigate potential national security concerns, including protecting sensitive government information and giving notice to the government over future sale plans.Lady Nadine Cobham, the daughter-in-law of the company’s founder Sir Alan Cobham, said: “This is a deeply disappointing announcement and one cynically timed to avoid scrutiny on the weekend before Christmas.“In one of its first major economic decisions, the government is not taking back control so much as handing it away.“In Cobham we stand to lose yet another great British defence manufacturer to foreign ownership, through a takeover that would never have been approved by the Americans, French or Japanese, all of whom have taken steps recently to raise protections for their own defence sectors.”Boris Johnson defended the sale. He said: “I think it’s very important that we should have an open and dynamic market economy.A lot of checks have been gone through to make sure that in that particular case all the security issues that might be raised can be satisfied and the UK will continue to be a very, very creative and dynamic contributor to that section of industry and all others.” The business, founded in 1934 as Flight Refuelling Ltd, was floated in 1985 but the family maintained a large stake. The firm’s air-to-air refuelling technology played a key role in the 1982 Falklands war.Leadsom said: “This decision has been meticulously thought over, and I have taken advice from the defence secretary, the deputy national security adviser and government officials across multiple departments. I have also met with both of the companies on several occasions, as have several senior members of my department.“Having considered the consultation responses and further advice from the defence secretary, I am satisfied that the undertakings mitigate the national security risks identified to an acceptable level and have therefore accepted them and cleared the merger to proceed.“While trade and investment play an important part in the UK economy, when intervening in mergers on national security grounds, I will not hesitate to use my powers to protect national security, if it is appropriate to do so.“Separately, the companies have given a legally binding commitment that there will be significant protection of jobs and have also agreed with the takeover panel that Cobham’s headquarters will remain in the UK, that the Cobham name will continue to be used and that there will be a guaranteed level of R\u0026ampD spend. This will secure the future of Cobham and the important role it plays in our world-leading defence sector and economy.”Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, joined in criticism of the merger. “It is deeply concerning that the Conservative government is allowing this sale to go ahead, despite previously cited concerns that it could undermine our national security. While Andrea Leadsom claims these concerns have been mitigated we have yet to see evidence of this,” he said.“If Boris Johnson’s government are happy to sell off a leading UK defence and aerospace company to Trump’s America, how can we expect his government to protect our defence and manufacturing sectors, not to mention every other sector of our economy, as they negotiate trade deals after Brexit?”David Lockwood, the chief executive of Cobham, said: “We are grateful to the secretary of state for her diligent handling of the process over the last few weeks and the certainty she has delivered for all stakeholders, most importantly our employees, before the Christmas break.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67294250dbc4c17d4e3434123640eb43c0e6df9/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984315120fcfa281a6478ac35de5ccbb","title":"persimmon ex chief yet to set up promised bonus charity","story":"Revelation comes almost two years since Jeff Fairburn’s pledge to donate ‘substantial portion’ of his £85m bonusJeff Fairburn, the former chief executive of the housebuilder Persimmon, has failed to set up a charity almost two years after pledging to do so in an attempt to assuage public and political anger at his “obscene” £85m bonus.Fairburn has not registered a charity with the Charity Commission or made any inquiries about how to set one up, 22 months after he said he would donate a “substantial proportion” of his bonus to a charitable trust. He is also not named as a trustee of any charity in England or Wales. It is not known whether he has donated to any separate existing charity.The revelation that Fairburn appears not to have set up a foundation to donate any of his bonus comes days after an independent review found that Persimmon had built homes so shoddily that it left its customers exposed to an “intolerable risk” in the event of fire.The review, commissioned by the Permission board, said the company had failed its customers due to “a manifestation of poor culture”. The report by Stephanie Barwise QC, who also represents victims of the Grenfell fire disaster, said the bonuses paid to executive directors in 2018-19, including Fairburn, were “were widely perceived as excessive”. The current management was urged to “reconsider Persimmon’s purpose and ambition”. was unable to contact Fairburn for comment. Citigate Dewe Rogerson, the PR company that helped Fairburn, 53, to defend his bonus, which was inflated by the taxpayer-funded, help-to-buy scheme, said it was unable to provide his contact detail or put questions to him.He made the pledge to set up a “private charitable trust” to support good causes in a “meaningful way” in February 2018 in order to deflect anger at the award, which had been reduced from £110m.A Charity Commission spokeswoman said: “We have no record of a registered charity bearing Jeff Fairburn’s name. Nor does it appear Mr Fairburn is a current trustee of an active charity. We can’t categorically state that no charity has been registered that involves Mr Fairburn in some capacity. It would also not be possible for us to confirm whether or not any funds have been donated via another charity.”Luke Hildyard, who campaigns against excessive executive remuneration at the High Pay Centre, said: “This ongoing saga shows why the charitable giving of the super-rich doesn’t justify gross concentration of wealth. Despite a few high-profile exceptions, rich people are generally quite miserly. Evidence suggests they give a smaller proportion of their income to charity than middle and low earners.“Given the controversial nature of the original payment, some clarity on if and when the promised foundation will be established would be appropriate. But more importantly, we need to put corporate governance measures in place that stop these excessive pay awards and address the fact that the UK is one of the most unequal economies in the developed world.”When he made the pledge to set up a charitable trust Fairburn said: “I am making my plans public and recognise that I should have done so sooner. I am setting up a private charitable trust which I plan to use to benefit wider society over a sustained period of time by supporting, in a very meaningful way, my chosen charities.“I would like to make it clear that I did not seek these levels of award nor do I consider it right to keep them entirely for myself. Once it became apparent that our outperformance would lead to a very significant award for me, I made plans to use a substantial proportion of the total to support the charities that are particularly important to me and my family.”The bonus payments result from a scheme linked to the housebuilder’s share price, which soared thanks to the help-to-buy programme. About half of Persimmon’s homes are bought with its assistance.Vince Cable, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, had said the scale of the bonus was “obscene” and built on a government subsidy. “It is reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bb1aa482e707c4e86d323b7ef7be09f430047f0/0_153_1891_1134/master/1891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=717f6fccb5881a38bc6b5a0ff43c04ec","title":"we fought militant in the 1980s far left hold now much worse","story":"For once, Labour has been quick off the mark. It is only 10 days since the party lost a fourth consecutive general election and it is already preparing for its next defeat.Despite the obvious truth that Jeremy Corbyn must take the blame for the worst result in almost 100 years, Rebecca Long Bailey, his anointed successor, is the favourite to succeed him as party leader. Her election, which is close to being certain, would be the public statement that Corbyn has gone but Corbynism lives on.Labour supporters, who want to win the next election, should not despair. The party’s future success, perhaps even its survival, depends on the genuine democratic socialists in the parliamentary party seizing control of the political agenda. The elevation of Long Bailey would provide an early opportunity to demonstrate that they mean business.The cause would be best served by an outright refusal to accept the imposition of a leader who does not command their confidence. A formal protest with a recorded vote would be almost as effective. Emboldened, they must then insist that the shadow cabinet is, once again, elected – giving its members an independent authority that they would not possess as the leader’s nominees. With their status restored, they would be free to challenge the strategy and tactics of both the leader and the advisers who, with Corbyn, must take some of the blame for the bloodbath of “black Thursday” and are, even now, arranging to remain surrogate leaders in the new regime.Labour MPs are notorious for their reluctance to fight the ideological battle for democratic socialism. The common response to the complaint that they have watched, but not opposed, the triumphant progress of the far left is the claim that at least they “stayed and fought”. More often than not, they stayed without fighting.If they fight now they will, of course, be accused of splitting the party. In truth they will be preventing, or at worst postponing, the real split that is bound to follow a further drift to the unelectable left. The second accusation will be the creation of a “party within a party”. A distinct and separate party of the far left has been a cuckoo in Labour’s nest ever since Ed Miliband’s invention of cut-price membership. Men and women who had spent long, dark nights outside Labour meetings hawking revolutionary newspapers came in from the cold – bringing their sectarian intolerance with them.They became the pathfinders for the most extensive and, it must be admitted, most successful takeover bid in Labour history. At its heart was Momentum, which began life under the guise of Corbyn’s Praetorian Guard but swiftly evolved into a vehicle for moving the party to what turned out to be the unelectable left. Momentum infiltrated constituency parties, enrolled enough delegates to successive annual conferences to gain a stranglehold on party policy, took effective control of Labour’s national executive committee and attempted – with a measure of success – to “deselect” Labour MPs who did not share its prejudices. Momentum found natural allies in recent conversions from Marxist and Trotskyite factions who, encouraged by the hope of colonising a real and functioning political party, suddenly saw the light.Compared with Momentum, the Militant tendency – which attempted to subvert Labour in the 1980s – was a ragbag of second-rate conspirators who took corrupt control of Liverpool but were only an irritant in other parts of the country. No Militant sympathisers were employed in the Labour party headquarters or in its regional offices, and no major trade union leader supported Militant’s aims. Now full-time officials openly boast of their Momentum membership. Militant remained an obscure sect.Thanks in part to Momentum, the Corbyn project was endorsed by thousands of good democratic socialists. The radical rhetoric obscured the fatal flaws of Corbyn’s philosophy – the blanket opposition to private enterprise, the support for any tinpot dictator who called himself a socialist, the intolerance of disagreement, the failure to cleanse Labour of antisemitism which proved that, although he hated racial prejudice, there were some racial prejudices that he did not hate enough. There is no doubt that there is still an army of Labour party members who cannot bring themselves to believe that the Corbyn project was destined to end in disaster. They have to be persuaded that Corbyn’s way could only ever lead to the disappointment of defeat and the betrayal of the millions of families who need a Labour government. No doubt Momentum’s leaders are still rejoicing about the control they achieved over the party machine. The celebrations are not being replicated in the food bank queues that, following Labour’s defeat, will only lengthen.Before the brilliance of Neil Kinnock’s Bournemouth conference speech in 1985 extinguished the hopes of Militant, outriders spent two years preparing the ground for his final assault. For Labour to become a party of government again it needs another army of genuine democratic socialist MPs mounting a similar onslaught on the great ideal’s false friends. Their task will be more than the recruitment of new party members to become a counterweight to infiltrators from the unelectable extremes. They must convince floating voters that democratic socialism is alive, well and ready to wake from its slumbers – and is worth voting for. Thanks to the Corbyn project, few people believe that today.It may be that the parliamentary party is not in a mood to heed the calls to arms. The self-styled “moderates” have always suffered from an excess of caution. But if there is to be a fight, have no doubt that the real democratic socialists will occupy the high ground.We are the apostles of true equality and the personal freedom that it must sustain. And we offer the politics of hope – not empty slogans about the better world we hope to build but a real chance of bringing it about. A genuine democratic socialist party can win elections.

The Tories, so the story goes, won over huge swaths of Labour voters by a willingness to back greater state intervention and increased public spending. Labour lost them by a refusal to shift on questions of crime or ersity.Long before the Tory demolition of Labour’s “red wall”, it had become accepted almost as a given that the working class was intrinsically socially conservative. The abandonment by working-class voters of social democratic parties throughout Europe, and their embrace of populism, was seen by many as a rejection of the liberal values that define the left.The working class, runs the argument, is rooted in communities and cherishes values of family, nation and tradition. It has little time for liberal inidualism or for the language of ersity and rights. That belongs to the “metropolitan liberals” and to a different political tradition. Indeed, many argue that if Britain’s electoral system were not rooted in a first-past-the-post system, the Labour party would have already broken into two, one part representing the socially conservative but economically leftwing working class, the other liberal metropolitans. Labour now faces a choice: either accept that its traditional working-class voters are gone forever or abandon liberal social policies.The trouble with this argument is that the key feature of Britain over the past half century has been not social conservatism but an extraordinary liberalisation. The annual British Social Attitudes survey, which began recording public attitudes in 1983, has tracked “the onward march of social liberalism”. On a host of issues, from gender roles to gay marriage, from premarital sex to interracial relationships, Britain has liberalised to a degree that would have left the average Briton of the 1980s aghast. It’s not just metropolitan liberals but society as a whole, including the working class, which has embraced this change.In today’s discussions about working-class attitudes, “social conservatism” has been redefined to mean not opposition to gay marriage or premarital sex, but support for a far narrower cluster of views: harsher punishments for criminals, a more patriotic attitude and, in particular, a clampdown on immigration. Even here, the reality is more complex. It’s true that there are deep class ides on immigration, with differences between the views of unskilled workers and those of professionals being the widest in Europe. Yet, nearly a third of unskilled workers are “pro-immigrant” and almost half think that Britain should allow in “many” or “some” migrants from poorer European countries. That’s a sizable contrarian minority within a supposedly uniformly hostile working class.Historically, hostility to liberal inidualism has taken conservative and radical forms. Conservatives saw history, tradition and the nation as the means by which the inidual became part of a greater whole. For radical critics of liberalism, an inidual realised himself or herself not through tradition but through struggles to transform society, from battles for decent working conditions to campaigns for equal rights. These struggles created organisations, such as trade unions and civil rights movements, which drew iniduals into new modes of collective life and forged new forms of belonging.These broad ways of thinking of “community” have long coexisted in tension. But in recent years, as trade unions have weakened and social movements crumbled, it has seemed for many that the only form of collective politics left is that rooted in conservative, Burkean notions of national or ethnic identity.The problem is not that metropolitan liberals have become too liberal or the working class more conservative. It is that social and economic changes have unstitched the relationship between the social and the liberal that defines the left the relationship between a defence of community, of policies that put social need before private profit and a defence of rights, whether of gay people or migrants, and of opposition to unequal treatment. It’s a relationship expressed throughout the history of working-class struggles, from 19th-century opposition to slavery, to the defence of Jewish communities against Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts in the 1930s, to the support for the Grunwick strikers in the 1970s.Today, the unpicking of that relationship is visible in everything from accommodation to antisemitism and anti-migrant rhetoric, on the one hand, to the easy dismissal of working-class voters as ignorant and racist, on the other. The challenge for the left is not to embrace social conservatism but to reforge the link between the social and the liberal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a8e8a153d5fc0c07c384eb1e9502154557fac5/0_210_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01ac72b03d161937e377f1b4f1584450","title":"labour repelled voters political graveyard david miliband","story":" In 2017, Corbyn’s defeat was diagnosed as a victory. Now, the danger is that the excuses outrun the facts again At three successive elections in the last decade, Labour has failed to address the reasons for its defeat. The consequence is simple. We lose again. The electorate send us back to the classroom. This time, a similar failure, a further relapse into denial, and the result could be fatal for the party and the communities we are supposed to serve. The question for the party is fundamental: are we really serious about getting back into government? If not, then it is the political graveyard not just the classroom that beckons.In 2010, Labour won eight seats out of 210 in the south of England outside London. But we were told that the problem was the Blair legacy, even though we had won many of those seats in the Iraq-stained election of 2005. We underestimated our opponents and moved into the comfort zone of talking to ourselves.In 2015, Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership by attacking our time in government. Reforms to the Labour leadership voting system, by limiting the role of MPs, further reduced our connection to the real electorate: voters. The result was a Corbyn leadership which failed to command the confidence of MPs or ultimately the public.In 2017, a defeat was diagnosed as a victory. We significantly increased our vote share but not our number of MPs against the worst Conservative campaign in living memory. We were sold the category error of confusing opinion poll support for inidual policies with support for the programme as a whole.Now in 2019, the danger is that the excuses outrun the facts again. The voters could not be clearer. It is not only Corbyn who needs to be replaced, but his politics: the ideology, the worldview, the theory of political change.Labour literally repelled voters in 2019. “Out of touch” does not capture the full awfulness. Voters were all too in touch with what the Labour leadership stood for. Incredible promises were all too well understood. So was the unctuous sectarianism of the leadership clique. Together they came to be seen as more of a risk to the country than Brexit – even though every study shows that it will cost the poorest communities the most.John McDonnell said at the 2017 party conference that the more dire the situation a Labour government inherits, the more radical would need to be its efforts. Fair enough. The greater the inequality, the greater the need for remediation. There was and is an appetite for a step change from austerity that is serious about redistribution and wealth creation.But there is a corollary. The greater the proposed radicalism, the greater the credibility needed of the policy and and the plan and the team to make the changes. Labour failed on all counts. Every extra promise weakened the appeal of all the promises.Credibility is scorned by the hard left. We are told it means sucking up to the establishment. Or taking Tory positions. Rubbish. It is about recognising that people with the least have the most reason to be risk averse about taking a chance on the future. And we should take our cue from them. If you are proposing to make a big change in someone’s life, they want to be sure that you know what you are doing. Radicalism without credibility is just posturing.In America they say an election campaign is an MRI on your character. Yet the leadership culture was toxic. The failure to acknowledge, never mind address, antisemitism is a moral scar. The sectarianism addressed at those who disagreed with the edicts of the leadership was disgraceful. Remember it was only the early election which called off the hounding of MPs with deselection. Eddie Mair called Boris Johnson a “nasty piece of work”. Voters rightly concluded the same about Labour’s hard left.Of course Brexit was an issue (though smaller than Corbyn and his promises). But the Labour evasions over three years exacerbated the problem. So neither leavers nor remainers were happy. Doing a deal with Europe in three months. Then refusing to campaign for or against it. It did not add up. There is no evidence that Labour MPs who backed a second referendum did worse than those who did not. It was the leadership decision to support the Tory call for an election before Brexit was resolved that was terrible hubris.The agenda in 2023 or 2024 will have important differences from the present. But the choice of the electorate will be driven by many of the same questions. Whether the values of the Labour leader and top team offer a progressive patriotism. Whether the vision of the party speaks to the real issues facing the country. Whether the plans can be explained, paid for and delivered. Whether the team represents the aspirations of the country. Whether the leader is actually a leader.Attlee passed this test. So did Wilson. And Blair. Only three Labour leaders have ever won a working majority. Let’s learn from the successes and not split the difference with the failures. It would be absurd to say the policies should be the same. I don’t propose a rerun of 1997 any more than of 1945. But the politics – the clarity, the positioning, the orientation to the future not the past, the capacity to lead – is timeless. That is what I will be looking for in the leadership candidates.The next leadership team needs to show the British people that they recognise the fundamental errors of policy and character that made Labour unelectable. Its apology needs to be profound and real. It needs to rebuild Labour as a broad church. Merit, not sect, needs to drive promotion. Labour in local government – where more is being done with less resource – needs to be an emblem of what Labour can do. And the policy agenda needs to show flexibility not rigidity. Public ownership has its place in a mixed economy. But if nationalisation is the single transferable answer to every economic problem, no one will believe it.I am convinced that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy disaster since appeasement in the 1930s. But if Brexit is even half as bad as I think it will be, then the choices at the next election – about priorities, about tax and spending, about the sustenance of the UK, about the relationship with the EU – will be even harder than at this one. The overriding task for a new Labour leadership is to show that it has the imagination and competence to address them, free of the dogma that doomed the party in 2019.Angry? Worried? You bet. I am currently the most recent Labour foreign secretary. I don’t want to be the last Labour foreign secretary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd236837ccb6ab0ddc68bdd67ad9b93577623738/0_59_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9517e4c7762b2c9471b2600d00e7dd","title":"only aamon the demon is fit to replace jeremy corbyn","story":"During a brainstorming session to debate Labour’s new leader, dark forces loomed largeBoris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl’s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ Get-Brexit-Done Johnson is finally your elected prime minister! And the past decade’s worth of my multi-award-winning satirical standup sets seem like the sagely predictions of a seer.Sometimes I scare myself and I am a familiar face at the TK Maxx emergency underwear counter. Young activists in the Labour party recognise me as a doom barometer, and tremble when they encounter me. I agreed to meet some of the optimistic hope vessels for a brain-storming session and suggested a fashionably minimalist Dalston bar called Untitled, as if to satirise the youthful city-dwelling socialists’ perceived cultural isolationism.In Workington, for example, pubs still have the names of actual things: the Henry Bessemer is named after the inventor of the Bessemer steel manufacturing process the Pack Horse is named after an actual horse that did actual work, exactly the kind of horse with genuine non-racist anxieties about foreign horses that is now deserting the Labour party in droves and there’s Vinnie’s Bar, which is probably named after Vinnie Jones. Or Vinnie Vincent, who replaced Ace Frehley in Kiss. Either way, it isn’t named after something that isn’t even a thing, like a bar in Hackney called Untitled where metropolitan liberal elitists go.“Should shell-shocked Labour double down with a new leader from its far left again or aim for the centre ground,” I opined, as the activists licked their alcopopsicles. “Sadly, no Labour leader, however convincing, can win an election while the lies of unregulated social media, the false claims of the Conservatives themselves and both the bias and impotence of mainstream media all remain untreated. In short, it doesn’t matter whose head is thrust into the threshing machine. They will still come back with a severely threshed head.” The youngsters nodded in baffled agreement at my aged wisdom.“A Frankingstein assembled from leftover body parts attractive both to the wine-quaffing, avocado-crushing, lentil-souffle-nibbling, champagne-socialist hypocrites of Hackney and the chip-butty-gobbling, fish-gut-snuffling, raw-offal-scoffing racist troglodytes of Hull will never fly,” I continued, holding forth. “And yet the Labour party thinks it needs to unite these two incompatible, and quite frankly vile and unacceptable, stereotypes.”“Then how,” asked one young woman, her mascara still smeared from days of unstinting weeping, “do we unite Labour supporters in constituencies as different as Hull and Hackney? I’ve never been to Hull, but I am told it is not the same as London at all. Do they have any of those cafes that only serve breakfast cereals, for example?”“Deluded strategists think the Hull-Hackney ide could be bridged by choosing Rebecca Long-Bailey as leader,” I condescended, “as long as she is made to visit more fringe-theatre productions, go around on a bike towing a trailer full of children in £28 Cath Kidston bobble hats and be photographed at Glastonbury dancing to Toots and the Maytals. Others think the solution is as simple as electing Keir Starmer leader, but never allowing him to appear anywhere except at bookmakers and never without mushy peas, curry sauce and saveloy dip smeared all round his mouth.”“You can get all mushy peas in the chip shop opposite the cemetery,” piped up Dan, hopefully. “Shall I ask them who their supplier is and then we can get masses of the bloody stuff ready to smear on Keir when victory is near?”“It’s too late for that,” I explained, leading the activists out across the road towards De Beauvoir Place, now rebuilt from wartime bomb rubble. “The media and the opposition will demonise any Labour leader that Turds faces across the house. Best to meet the problem head on. The party should be led instead by an actual demon.”“Come on, Grandad! Demons aren’t real!” exclaimed a spotty cynic, unaware that he was standing on the very site of the 1854 birthplace of Aleister Crowley’s acolyte, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who conjured them all, one by one, and knew each of their secret and unholy names.“Not far from here Mathers summoned Aamon, the Marquess of Hell, governor of 40 infernal legions, in the form of a wolf with a serpent’s tail, retching forth flames,” I told the incredulous Labour party activists. “And when they walked south towards Arnold Circus Aamon took the shape of a man, so as not to cause commotion, but his mouth was full of dogs’ teeth and he hid his head, suddenly that of a hawk, beneath a black hood. In the words of Mathers himself, ‘Aamon telleth all things Past and to Come. He procureth feuds and reconcileth controversies between friends.’ Put Aamon in charge. You cannot demonise a demon.”“How about Jess Phillips instead?” piped up an insolent youngster. “She’d be a great match for Johnson in parliament. His cynicism and lies would look feeble before her passion and honesty and she’s properly funny, rather than just saying things in Latin. And she’s all over the detail, whereas he just wings it. And people trust anyone with a Birmingham accent, thinking them incapable of guile. It would play badly when Johnson bullies and patronises her too. The answer is staring us in the face.”“What use is this ‘Aamon’ of yours to the parliamentary Labour party,” squawked another youth, “and why is a demon a more logical choice than, for example, Angela Rayner or even Lisa Nandy?”And then I realised I was alone. The young socialists were drinking small sour drinks and sampling Japanese sharing plates somewhere. And I was on the pavement as it started to rain, shouting up at an obsolete golden chicken, perched atop a former Courage pub, now a Nando’s. “You finally really did it. You maniacs. God damn you. God damn you all to hell.”Extra London dates of Stewart Lee’s latest live show, SnowflakeTornado, have just been announced at the Southbank Centre in June and July, and it tours nationally from January. stewartleelive-dates"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31905b110e21d1c576fb01998167b18fd74a18b5/0_236_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f884e4bcca78c98f4970e8351f692ea","title":"women christmas hard work","story":"It was two weeks before Christmas last year and my friend Julie called me in a panic. “I’m on deadline at work, my mum is sick, it’s days before the kids finish school and my in-laws arrive, and now this,” she said with an edge of hysteria. “My little boy’s Secret Santa project has to be homemade and turned in by Friday!”Julie’s exhausted expression of the inverse of holiday cheer sounded strikingly familiar to the lament I’d heard from countless women: how am I going to get it all done before Christmas Day? Julie took a deep breath and concluded, “I’m screwed.” In my day job, I’m a Harvard-trained lawyer and mediator, but like so many women who do two-thirds or more of the household tasks – whether we work outside the home or not – I just did it all. When I finally hit my breaking point eight years ago, I embarked on a quest to make visible all the invisible, unacknowledged, unappreciated and largely unpaid labour women do in service to their families. I spoke candidly with more than 500 women and men, including childless couples, working and stay-at-home parents, co-parents, blended families and same-sex families, and along the way I became well-versed in this “special” time of year when women take on more than their fair share of the domestic workload in an annual effort to keep the magic alive.On top of everything else working women already do on any given day, now add shopping for, buying and wrapping presents (and sending them on time) addressing cards (and sending them on time) planning meals, attending parties, stuffing stockings, decorating the tree … and on and on it goes. All of this time-consuming, behind-the-scenes activity can make the season especially fraught, particularly for women who buy into the culturally popular (but maddening) messaging that asserts: this is a “me” job. I’m a better multi-tasker, so I’ll just do it. If I don’t do it, no one will. A study by Harvard researchers published this year in the American Sociological Review found that women reported doing more “cognitive labour” at home than their spouses did – anticipating needs (our son has a Secret Santa project due by the end of the week), identifying options for filling them (is the craft shop open today?), making decisions (what should we make?), and monitoring progress (will it be finished on time?). Strikingly, all couples in the Harvard study were highly educated, yet women still reported doing significantly more thinking about household management than their husbands.Many women I interviewed for my book, Fair Play, voiced a nervousness about having conversations with their partners over explicitly defined roles and expectations. But my interviews with husbands, partners and fathers revealed that when presented with these new conversations, they step up consistently and sustainably. Even more, the men who reported feeling the most confident and invested in their partner and parenting roles were those who felt empowered to take the lead and to completely “own” the jobs they do take on. So, in the spirit of having a fair play Christmas, I recommend pouring a glass of wine, sitting down with your partner and making intentional choices about how you want to spend the holiday together as a couple, or as a family.First, customise your deck. Based on my interviews with hundreds of couples, I’ve identified many seasonal “task cards” that can come into play at this time of year. Thoughtfully consider which cards you and your partner want to play so that the holidays don’t play you. The tasks that you agree are important may include: childcare (finding babysitters for adult-only parties and shopping) home goods (decorations, the Christmas tree, stringing lights on your roof) hosting memories and photos storage, garage and seasonal items (locating the ornaments, the tree stand and the box of lights, the menorah or kinara and candles) travel, packing and unpacking parents and in-laws gifts thank you notes charity and good deeds and so on. When you stop and write it down, the list can seem exhausting. And depending on your lifestyle and beliefs, yours may stretch even longer. But this visibility has value.Next, take an honest inventory of what you and your family most care about. What is important to you? Why are you doing what you do? External expectations? Family pressure? Or are you consciously choosing how you spend your time? If staying up past midnight to knit your children’s names on to their stockings doesn’t bring you joy, put down the needle and walk away. This Christmas, ditch the peer pressure and societal expectations and give yourself permission to do less.Once you and your partner have an honest discussion and determine which tasks and traditions are worth the effort, deal the cards. What cards will each of you hold and what does this responsibility entail from start to finish?This is where you must get granular or you run the risk of doubling up on efforts or unintentionally dropping the ball. As an example: Christmas dinner. Who is planning it? You can both provide input, but only one person takes the lead. Agree on the menu based on preferences, dietary restrictions and budget. Establish a measurement of accountability. (All items, for example, must be purchased or ordered by a specific date.) Then do the same with all the other cards in your deck.All of this may seem time-consuming, or pointless, or silly, but laying the groundwork and fairly sharing the load could improve your Christmas – and your relationship. Women report a significantly higher perception of domestic fairness when relieved of the cognitive labour, and many studies have found that the perception of fairness is a stronger predictor of a healthy marriage than the actual ision of domestic work. This year, in the spirit of creating meaningful connections and relationship building, invite your partner to be a true collaborator in the tasks and traditions that you mutually agree hold value and bring joy to your family. • Eve Rodsky is the author of Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (and More Life to Live)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6136de986bbfd2b7014a94a79d978f4556ff2289/0_461_6857_4115/master/6857.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c5b725d4d92b3ba9d96e328806daa7","title":"festival of the uk 2022 national portrait gallery 300 loans trial of christine keeler","story":"If a nebulous celebration can’t bring us together, maybe borrowing art from the National Portrait Gallery will do the trickIt’s going to be party time in 2022, apparently. The government, I hear, is lining up Martin Green, who ran the very successful Hull City of Culture during 2017, to take charge of a four nations arts extravaganza with a budget of £120m. Our beloved leader, who likes to emphasise that he is not just PM but also minister for the union, wants a festival of the UK. Anybody would think that threats of Scottish independence and a united Ireland were in the ether…?The 2022 Festival of the UK will be centred in Birmingham, which will also be hosting the Commonwealth Games, while the BBC, which will be celebrating (or commiserating) its centenary, will play its role with a raft of relevant programmes. (And hopefully not dancing to the tune of the government to appease those demanding its funding be switched to subscription.)I’m in two minds about this cultural cornucopia. Good that the arts, design and creative industries will, Heineken-like, reach parts often starved. It worked before with Liverpool, European Capital of Culture in 2008, whose legacy is still lasting, and with Hull, though Derry has not fared so well after being City of Culture in 2013. My problem with this plan, aside from the danger of this government making it into a union flag-waving, post-Brexit jamboree, is its very vastness and non-specificity. The whole of the UK? What’s the uniting force, arts-wise?The National Portrait Gallery will itself be reaching out from mid-2020 until 2023, loaning about 300 works a year to galleries and museums, hospitals and schools. The reason for such largesse is that the NPG will be closed during this period for a massive refurbishment. Still, it’s good to make these loans to places such as Bath, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Belfast, as well as to National Trust properties. It will also be lending portraits of noted people to the towns with which they are most associated – like one of Meera Syal, who hails from the Black Country and who will visit Wolverhampton Art Gallery to see her portrait or Florence Nightingale, whose picture will go to Derby’s museum as her family came from nearby.I hear that about 400 NPG members have cancelled their annual subscriptions since the closure was announced in early November. About 1,250 have renewed though, presumably lured by the offer of a three-year membership for the cost of one. This will give them free or reduced price entry into some regional museums where the loans are heading. And before the NPG closes in June next year, the gallery will bow out with exhibitions of David Hockney drawings and Cecil Beaton’s photos of his Bright Young Things. Some exit.Do watch The Trial of Christine Keeler, a six-part series on BBC One about the girlfriend of Tory politician John Profumo, starting on 29 December. Starring Sophie Cookson as Keeler and Ellie Bamber as Mandy Rice-Davies it is written by Amanda Coe, directed by Andrea Harkin, and has two female producers.

In this, Clary’s fourth pantomime season at the prestigious venue, he has effectively become a permanent fixture: his face has just gone up on the theatre’s “wall of fame”, alongside stars such as Judy Garland and Ken Dodd.But the performer and author, a man infamous for over-sharing for comic effect on stage, still has a few secrets hiding under his outlandish costume as the Ringmaster in Goldilocks and the Three Bears.Not only is Clary soon to play a serious theatrical role, starring opposite Matthew Kelly in a touring production of Ronald Harwood’s esteemed drama The Dresser, he has also written a stage show of his own, based on his successful series of children’s books, The Bolds.“I find as I get older I’ve got to challenge myself, otherwise life gets too easy,” Clary told the Observer. “I could get bored if I didn’t keep doing different things. So I like saying to myself, ‘I wonder if I could do that?’ and then throwing down the gauntlet. It is not to do with bravery it is just to do with stimulating myself.”The five-week run of Goldilocks, in which Clary co-stars with Gary Wilmot, Paul Zerdin, Paul O’Grady and Nigel Havers, forms a break in a big national tour of his one-man stand-up show, Born to Mince, which resumes in April.“I did my tour, then I wrote the latest Bolds book over the summer, finishing it about a week before I started work on the panto,” said Clary. “I just compartmentalise. My brain couldn’t cope with it any other way, because they are such different activities. And I like the contrast. I like being applauded on stage, but I also like being locked away at home using a different part of the brain – my inner life and all that sort of carry-on.”Perhaps the pantomime star’s most surprising admission, however, is that he does not much like Christmas. A bonus of appearing in Goldilocks is that Clary, 60, is permanently unavailable for seasonal socialising. “Panto is really physically tiring because it means 12 shows a week,” he said. “But then I don’t have to go to Christmas parties because I am busy. I don’t like them because you have to be nice to people and smile all the time.“I also like doing panto at such a grim, wintry time of year. You are in this magical world on stage for the run and, by the time you have finished, and perhaps had a holiday, then spring is on the way. And the show is at the Palladium, so that is endlessly thrilling. And I do get to sleep in my own bed, unlike touring.”News that Clary’s image was to be ensconced on the theatre’s wall of fame came in the form of a “posh-looking” letter from the theatre’s owner, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and his wife Madeleine Gurdon.“It is just a lovely thing,” said Clary. “I am up there next to Shirley Bassey and near Norman Wisdom. Cilla Black and Jimmy Tarbuck are there too. I can’t believe my luck just working here, to be honest.”Clary’s outrageous costumes are a key element of the panto, and this year they are bigger than ever. Yet the brunt of the hard work, he said, is borne off-stage by his dressers.“It is the putting them on and off me that is the difficult part,” he said. “They have to hoik them on to my shoulders and I just have to stagger on to the stage, take the applause, say a few lines and go off. It’s easy.”This year he is also surreptitiously studying his dresser, in preparation for playing one in Harwood’s play.“I spend all day with my dresser because if I am not on stage I am getting changed and so, yes, whether you want it or not, you have some sort of relationship going on. They have to make my dinner and say nice things to me, as well as change my shoes.”The Dresser opens in August next year, so it “is not yet keeping me awake”, Clary said. “It is a play I love, and one that I thought maybe I could do – something I can get my teeth into. It is funny – and I do like making people laugh – but it is also very sad.”Live theatre, Clary suspects, remains in demand, despite the growing attraction of on-screen entertainment. “Theatre is totally absorbing and transporting, whereas watching something on the screen isn’t for me,” he said. “It is escapism, and that is what people need.”And those performers who can offer audiences some extravagant fun are at a premium, Clary believes. “Oh yes, people are clamouring for it. Particularly a show like Goldilocks that is just nonsense. It is lavish and spectacular, and so much work has gone into it, but it is lightweight. That is what I like about it.”Young readers of his books can expect something a little tamer than the full-on stage persona when Clary makes a personal appearance for his publisher, Penguin.“I know to be careful. I can multi-task,” he said. “When I am reading a story, if some of the parents titter, then so be it. There is a character called Roger the Sheep, and if you want to see innuendo in Roger the Sheep, then you can. It is entirely up to you, and the children don’t see it, hopefully.”Clary’s growing “multitasking” career may be a joy to him, but he knows it is hard work for his agents. “There is a literary agent, a comedy agent and an acting agent and they all have to stay in touch. But that is their problem, not mine. I don’t see why I have to pick just one occupation. It is like being a field I just rotate and then lie fallow for a while.”Goldilocks and the Three Bears is at the London Palladium until 12 January 2020. The Dresser will go on tour from September "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

It is where I keep the homemade damson jam and grapefruit marmalade, preserved fruit and mincemeat, and pots of fig chutney.At Christmas, the stoppered jars are joined by glowing curls of candied orange and citron peel marrons glacés in pleated golden foil and sugar-crusted fruit jellies of orange and lemon and blackcurrant. There are bars of nougat and soft and chewy turron panettone and cellophane bags of rose and lemon Turkish delight that I buy loose and caked in icing sugar from one of the Turkish shops down the road.There is cake, too: a sultana and cherry freckled cake awaiting its blanket of primrose-hued marzipan, a stollen in a hinged wooden box, and a flat, snow-white disc of panforte, its icing-sugar surface studded with almonds, hazelnuts and candied peel. To their right are paper-wrapped, soft-crumbed amaretti in a golden tin. That dense, vanilla-scented panforte is the prince of Christmas sweetmeats. I’m not sure it is worth making your own. The best are on the soft side, wrapped in brown paper and string and are light for their size.I am making an ice-cream parfait for after Christmas dinner. A dessert to keep in the freezer and serve in slices (and, should you wish, trickled with dark, sweet sherry.) Think of a classic vanilla ice, but warmed with the butterscotch notes of maple syrup and flecked with crumbled panforte. A luxurious dessert, as befits the season, we served it with strips of candied peel. It has a hint of Christmas pudding about it, but this is lighter after Christmas dinner and, with luck, will please the plum-pudding naysayers.You may need something for the carol singers that is less work than rolling pastry and making mince pies. Some soft almond and dried-fruit cookies might be the answer. (Made a few days in advance they keep well in an airtight tin.) I will also mention they are good for crumbling into hot custard or ice-cream or for passing round with coffee after dinner.A soft, cut-and-come-again frozen parfait you can slice straight from the freezer.

Beat the yolks and sugar together with a food mixer or large whisk until they are pale and fluffy. Stir the warm cream into the egg and sugar mixture, then rinse and dry the saucepan, return the custard to the pan and place over a moderate heat, stirring until the sauce is thick enough to lightly coat the back of the wooden spoon.Remove the custard from the heat and cool quickly, either by pouring into a cold bowl and stirring for a few minutes to encourage the steam to leave, or by putting the bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice. Once the custard has cooled, put the bowl in the fridge and leave till cold.Break or slice half the panforte into small crumbs. Crumble the amaretti likewise then fold into the cold custard. Stir in the maple syrup. Transfer to the lined cake tin, pushing the mixture deep into the corners, then smooth the surface with the back of a spoon, fold over the clingfilm and freeze for at least 4 hours.

I find this is best done using a food mixer with a flat beater attachment, but you can do it by hand, too. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Break the eggs into a small bowl and beat them lightly with a fork to mix yolks and whites.Chop the dried apricots into small pieces, followed by the candied peel. Chop the almonds and pistachios.Add the beaten eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, a little at a time, adding a spoonful of the flour if the mixture appears grainy. Stir in the remaining flour, then the fruit, peel and nuts. Make sure the ingredients are thoroughly combined but take care not to overmix.Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Place heaped teaspoons of the cookie dough on the baking tray, leaving enough room for each to spread a little. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the biscuits are pale nut coloured. They should still be soft when you take them from the oven. Let the baked biscuits rest for 5 minutes, then lift them on to a cooling rack with a palette knife.Continue with the remaining mixture.

The Brazilians obliged and went off in search of somewhere else to drink, security returned to the main entrance and check-in proceeded without further incident, but reservations over Qatar’s ability to stage a World Cup – never mind its suitability – had begun. Six days at the Club World Cup have not dispelled them.Qatar is a desert under construction with a global workforce mobilised to build eight stadiums and new infrastructure in time for 2022. The results from the cheap migrant labour are extremely impressive. The new metro system is immaculate – and 40p to ride in a spacious carriage that could pass for first-class in Britain – the completed and even half-built stadia look spectacular and so, too, the hotel complexes that are rising up along the Gulf coast.But a World Cup is not just about 64 matches and the experience for those visiting Qatar between 21 November and 18 December 2022 promises to be unlike anything encountered before. As it does for the World Cup’s Muslim hosts and hopes that fans of 31 other nations will respect their culture and beliefs.The Club World Cup has been used by Fifa as a dry run for the main event in 2022 and next year when the tournament returns to Qatar. Dry run being a completely inappropriate phrase in a country with strict controls on the consumption of alcohol. Hotel bars are the usual place to drink – for around £12 a pint – providing the drinker is a resident or has a passport to hand. Not ideal when the masses descend in 2022.The same applies to the polite metro staff and their requests, in the pre-season friendly atmosphere of the Liverpool v Monterrey semi‑final on Wednesday, for supporters to queue single-file at the ticket barriers when exiting Sport City station. Again, it is hard to imagine fans of certain countries at the World Cup being so obliging or as patient as the fans who queued for an hour to gain entry to the stadium as a result of stringent security checks.A fan zone was set up for the Club World Cup at Doha Sports Park – £5 a pint – with supporters bussed to matches at Khalifa International Stadium almost an hour away. More will be in operation during the World Cup and local organisers appear confident these will keep supporters occupied outside of matches. That seems optimistic, although the fan zone does demonstrate the willingness of Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) to cooperate with fans and relax laws.Hassan Al Thawadi, secretary general of SC, visited Liverpool as part of the organisation’s preparations for the Club World Cup. SC members met Liverpool supporters’ group Spirit of Shankly and LGBT+ group Kop Outs when, as the SOS chair, Joe Blott, put it, “challenging discussions” were held over Qatar’s treatment of migrant workers, its human rights record and ban on homosexuality.“They engaged with us, unlike Uefa or the FA,” Blott says. “We’ve been guinea pigs to an extent. The Football Supporters’ Association and Football Supporters Europe are keen to find out what will happen at the World Cup and we have let them know everything we have been doing.“It has been incredibly positive. We raised our concerns about workers rights and human rights and LGBT issues and how safe it would be for our fans over there. It was forthright and they said they wanted to change and were taking steps.”SOS contacted SC last week after four Liverpool fans discovered they had been scammed over flights and tickets to the Club World Cup. The SC provided return flights for the final to those affected.North of Doha work continues on the Lusail Stadium, an 80,000-seat venue that will stage the opening game of the World Cup and the final. When the tournament is over in a country with a smaller land mass than Northern Ireland, the stadium will be no more. It will be converted into a “community hub” of retail space, accommodation and community facilities. Of the other seven stadiums, one will be dismantled and shipped to Africa while 20,000 seats from each of the remaining six will be removed and given to stadiums in developing countries.One message heard regularly this past week is that the impending end of the kafala system, which ties migrant workers to sponsorship by their employer and prevents them moving jobs or leaving the country without approval, will have a ripple effect throughout the Gulf region.Ultimately you can only go on this journey with the private sector. You can write and enforce as many laws as you want but if the other side doesn’t implement them you have a breakdown in the process. Hopefully, by the end of this journey this is something that will be taken for granted and they’ll continue doing business the way we have established. We hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0682a8fe2d14eeb282e5c199cbdf91124c55d0e/0_211_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c5b5221f46ede2d9fd4d265b8086db7","title":"watford v manchester united premier league live","story":"So far, Manchester United’s social media team has not yet resorted to the #pogback hashtag. But there is time yet, even if Paul Pogba’s star does not shine nearly so brightly as in that heady summer of 2016 when Britain was heading out of the European Union and had a bright and shiny new prime minister. And, to get back to the football, even if he were fully fit, would have the right to challenge that redoubtable midfield partnership of Fred and Scott McTominay. Both are playing the best football of their time at United. This match will be preceded by a minute’s applause for World Cup winner Martin Peters, whose death was announced yesterday. Here’s some overnight news on Manchester United. Ole calls the shots, apparently. For Watford, Nigel Pearson seems to have been happy with his new charges’ performance against Liverpool and selects the same team. Troy Deeney to target Vic Lindelof? The big news is on the Manchester United bench: Paul Pogba, whose earrings looked resplendent as he arrived at Vicarage Road. Looks like his dancing at this brother’s wedding was a mark of a return to fitness. United were a little tardy in their arrival, 30 minutes late, in fact. Their logistics teams seems to have misjudged the Hertfordshire traffic this type of thing seems to happen rather too often.Here’s the teams in analogue, non-social media guff fashion. Here are the teams for todayHere’s the thing: Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s Manchester United are good against good teams, and bad against bad teams. Enter Watford, who have had so abominable a season that they are already on their third manager. One win all season, and just nine goals scored: it couldn’t happen here, could it? Enter Nigel Pearson. He’s already one game into his attempt to repeat Leicester’s great escape in the 2014-15 season and this time he can’t take any blame for his team being in the mire. Last week’s defeat to Liverpool showed positive signs, including a typically muscular approach from a Nige team. Expect to see Troy Deeney given rein to prove himself the on-pitch alpha male that his manager will be in the dug-out. Can Ole’s embryos live up the physical battering they might have to take at the Vicarage Road? Or will Watford’s need for victory push them forward and open the space that United’s quick attackers have made hay with?Kick-off 2pm UK time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148b317aa302eaab508db28471405c9eb64905c2/0_389_6727_4036/master/6727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303a9c5685f3a650e39c060001628961","title":"bohemian rhapsody inside new york chelsea hotel last apartments residents","story":"The Chelsea Hotel has been home to cultural icons from Janis Joplin and Andy Warhol for decades. As controversial renovations continue, Colin Miller photographs the hotel’s last remaining apartments and their residentsIn 2015, an architecture firm approached me to take some photographs of the renovations they’d made to the historic Chelsea Hotel after the building was sold. The photographs I took were forgettable, but when I looked down the iron staircase I saw something of the hotel’s former glory. Pieces of the tenants’ artwork decorated the stairwell and amid the construction mess were visible signs of a vibrant community of residents who cared deeply for their home. I had only a vague sense of the Chelsea then, primarily through the film Sid and Nancy and from living in New York on the edge of the punk scene.An aura of fame and creativity emanated from the hotel. Former residents include Allan Ginsberg, Arthur Miller, Stanley Kubrick, Bob Dylan and Patti Smith Dylan Thomas and Nancy Spungen died there Madonna lived and shot her Sex book there, and Leonard Cohen wrote two songs about the affair he had there with Janis Joplin. Struck by what I had seen, I set out to photograph the homes of the last remaining residents before the historic units were further sterilised. The Chelsea’s demise was imminent I had a precious few months before it would all disappear.I met resident Tony Notarberardino for the first time in 2015 and entering his apartment was like crossing into another dimension. In his living room, lit by dozens of candles, my wife and I were rapt as he told us about his life in the hotel. His bedroom was painted in deep reds and ochres and decorated as a kind of burlesque netherworld. When we stepped from the hotel on to 23rd Street the sounds of traffic suddenly returned and we found ourselves back in the real world. But Tony’s home had created a distinct and powerful shift in my perception of the hotel and I began to form a deeper understanding of the worlds people carved out there: his apartment was not only an extension of his personality, but a collection of the lives of those who had lived there before him. The Chelsea is a collaboration across time, an accumulation of the marks so many have made on it. At least until now.The renovation of the Chelsea has progressed very slowly. The months stretched to four years. In the intervening time it has changed ownership twice and it’s still unclear when the Chelsea will finally reopen. At the time of writing multiple lawsuits are pending. In the midst of ongoing renovation there has been terrible destruction, but there have also been victories. The remaining tenants have claimed their rent-stabilised status and may remain. Things are changing, but they’re not dying, as I had originally speculated. And, over time, my project evolved from a requiem to a celebration of what lives on at the Chelsea.This project is about how creative people forge a place for themselves during times of turmoil. The photographs capture a moment in this process and frame an instant of a city in constant transition. Gone are the times when those living alternative lifestyles could find shelter in New York for meagre rents. But those artists who found that at the Chelsea have persisted they’re still living creative and important lives. On one of my last shoots I met artist Bettina Grossman, a tenant at the Chelsea. I noticed on her door, as I was leaving, a small scrap of paper with the handwritten words “Sanctuary – Protect the Magic.” I hope my work will help to preserve and share some of the magic.Australian filmmaker Tony Notarberardino moved into the hotel in 1994, eventually landing in Dee Dee Ramone’s old apartment. It was previously occupied by artist Vali Myers, who’d turned her room into a living art installation, and entertained contemporaries including Patti Smith and Salvador Dali there. She painted the walls in rich, earthy yellows, reds, and browns, interspersed with checkerboard patterns and animal portraits. Notarberardino has resisted the developers, and argues that his refusal to renovate or leave is an important act of resistance that will help preserve the hotel’s history. “People want to come here and touch the wall that Jack Kerouac touched they want that authenticity.” If nothing else, he believes, the hotel might once again attract artists and musicians at the peaks of their careers. “The Chelsea’s going to outlive everybody.”With her husband, nightclub owner Arthur Weinstein, interior designer Colleen brought up their daughter Dahlia in the Chelsea. It took a while, though, for Colleen to come round to the apartment. The turning point was when they uncovered the original marble in the lobby. Since her father’s death, Dahlia has moved back in. As a kid she had mixed feeling about living in the hotel, but grew to love the actors, musicians and writers who populated the lobby. “Everyone was so friendly and open about their lives and their careers,” she remembers. “As I got older, I appreciated it more.”New York nightlife icon Susanne Bartsch arrived in Manhattan in 1987. Of her influence on the drag scene, RuPaul said Bartsch “picked up where Andy Warhol left off”. The transformation of her apartment at the Chelsea has been a proxy for her personal life. With one boyfriend she added a bedroom and curved hallway, with the next she painted the hallway electric pink, gold, and purple, the bedroom red (with an antique opium bed) and mosaiced the bathroom with mirrors. When she had a baby with her third partner, they took over the rooms once occupied by Janis Joplin. “The Chelsea Hotel is a bit like my mum,” Bartsch says, because she feels taken care of here. An interior design feature once referred to her apartment as a museum, but, says Bartsch, “It’s not that precious.”Hotel Chelsea: Living in the Last Bohemian Haven by Colin Miller and Ray Mock is out now (Monacelli Press, £40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed152009290027aef0c1e323a3b624601590290/0_181_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a1790b02da76ae8ff975408edb902af","title":"my lover has left me at the age of 77 and i miss her","story":"Maybe it’s time to concentrate on the relationship you already have, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma I’m 77 and have been married for 54 years. Seven years ago, I delivered the eulogy for a childhood friend. Afterwards the lady next to me held my hand and said, “Good job.” On impulse, I later found her phone number and called her. It was the start of a seven-year affair. She knew I was married. She was separated and later orced her husband. I told her that orcing my wife was out of the question. Also, I said eventually that someone would come along and steal her heart and that she would leave me.Our relationship was wonderful. In time she mentioned that she would like more. Even asked what it would be like if we were together all the time. I brushed these questions off, usually. I thought it was an ideal situation for both of us. She had grandchildren to look after and her daughter was going through a difficult marriage. Our relationship was not going any further. She turned 72 and I knew she was concerned about getting older.Well, it happened. Her only sibling passed away and a childhood friend – who she dated 50 years ago – came to the funeral. Afterwards she told me they were in love and that he was her soulmate. I bid her farewell and good luck. We have not communicated for four months. Do you think she’ll contact me?Mariella replies Well, this is unusual. First, it really is a whole new way of looking at what have been described – perhaps erroneously – as our twilight years. I used to regret the passage of time, as the births, engagement parties and wedding invites dried up and hospital visits and funerals laid a greater claim on my diary. Now I’m seeing the Eulogy Years in a whole new light. Who knew the whole funeral business was such a hotbed of recoupling? Perhaps since you now have a vacancy you should go to them more often, not just to say goodbye to old friends but also acquaintances, neighbours, even being a pew-filler at the ill-attended rites of strangers. Judging by your experience it sounds as though the heightened emotional atmosphere isn’t just energising the mourners to sing the hymns more fervently.The late Jimmy Goldsmith famously said that marrying your mistress creates a vacancy, and there’s obviously an empty space that you remain eager to fill. That means it wasn’t just an accident of timing and chemistry that spurred you into the arms of the lady in question but, rather, an unspecified and still unfulfilled need.I have to be true to form and sensible here. Why are you still with your wife? Do you see it as the decent, noble thing to do, despite your infidelity? Perhaps you’ve reached some sort of agreement that weighs the longevity of your union against indiscretions. You do sound like a casual Casanova, determining the boundaries of the relationship based on what suits you best. Is it possible that, even in your late 70s, you were just in it for the sex? If so, I don’t know whether to whoop for joy that the libido can “rage, rage against the dying of the light”, or curl up in exhaustion at the prospect of having to keep going for another two decades.I suspect you’re not writing to me for my wise words on extra-marital relationships but because you think I’m psychic! Sorry to disappoint, but I have no idea what your ex-mistress is likely to do. Your three short paragraphs are not enough to give me a clear idea of how this total stranger is likely to respond now that she’s found a less furtive relationship.What I can say is that you’ve had a pretty good innings. An enjoyable seven-year affair that’s left your wife none the wiser seems a pretty good result. You wouldn’t be human though if you didn’t want more. This inclination not to count our blessings but to want to increase them seems as natural as breathing to Homo sapiens. Having brushed off this woman’s attempts to make the liaison less ephemeral, you’ve now discovered what happens when that’s all you want. You won’t be the first man to learn to appreciate your lover once they’ve gone. Truly there really are only two courses of action. The first requires you to get in touch with this woman and admit that her absence has left you longing for contact. Though what you have to offer that she hasn’t now got is hard to surmise. The second is to thank your lucky stars for what you had and what you got away with and determine to inject a little of whatever it was that affair offered, even if it’s simply sex, into your marriage.To be revealed as a philanderer at any age is no great compliment but for it to happen when you truly are old enough to know better is bordering on embarrassing. My guess is that you’re a decent man who’s stuck with his partner through life’s ups and downs and, ironically, those are the very qualities that make you attractive to others. For my money that’s a far better legacy than chasing around after a woman who clearly wants what you’ve already got."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e89de4f6aad81299914d42201f71aadbb6efa1b/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18f00dde18babb225c636d2f3c65a1eb","title":"vegan boom veganuary retailers on trend","story":"Thousands sign up to stick to a plant-based diet next month, while hundreds of vegan food launches are in pipelineIt’s either a fad or a revolution, but whatever the future holds for veganism it’s set for another flexitarian-fuelled boom next month.The competition – dairy and livestock farmers – are clearly concerned, although it’s hard to tell exactly how much impact veganuary had last year. Initial reports from Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks consumer spending, showed that sales of meat remained fairly steady at the start of the year.But since then the firm has charted a significant decline in sales of beef, lamb and pork, although fish and chicken have grown, and a later Kantar study showed that 1.31m people gave up animal products in January 2019.Although many of the new products mimic meat, fish and cheese, from BBQ ribs and bleeding burgers to Camembert and smoked salmon, some vegan entrepreneurs believe they can persuade people to eat plant-based food that hasn’t been manipulated.Alex Petrides set up Allplants with his brother Jonathan in 2017 to offer vegan-only food subscription boxes – frozen meals delivered to your door. “We don’t use synthetic ingredients,” Petrides said, “but we do use the language people are familiar with and can connect to.

Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, touted as a possible leadership contender, is more likely to stand instead for the role of deputy leader.Long Bailey has yet to make any contribution to the debate over the party’s future direction since the election, amid signs that the Corbyn wing of the party is at odds over whether to promote her as a “continuity” candidate who will take forward the radical economic ideas championed by Corbyn and John McDonnell, or as a more independent-minded figure who wants to move on from Corbynism.On Saturday night a senior source close to McDonnell, who has long promoted Long Bailey as his protege, said the shadow chancellor had made a “conscious decision” not to play any role in the leadership contest. Supporters of other candidates believe the Long Bailey camp is struggling to unite amid the bitter fallout following the election result.On Sunday, also writing in the Observer, Labour’s former deputy leader Roy Hattersley makes the startling suggestion that if Long Bailey is chosen then moderate Labour MPs should refuse to accept her. “Despite the obvious truth that Jeremy Corbyn must take the blame for the worst result in almost 100 years, Rebecca Long Bailey, his anointed successor, is the favourite to succeed him as party leader,” Hattersley says.If she were to win, he says, “genuine democratic socialists in the parliamentary party” should strike back. “The elevation of Long Bailey would provide an early opportunity to demonstrate that they mean business. The cause would be best served by an outright refusal to accept the imposition of a leader who does not command their confidence. A formal protest with a recorded vote would be almost as effective. Emboldened, they must then insist that the shadow cabinet is, once again, elected – giving its members an independent authority which they would not possess as leader’s nominees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d71061cecf6f2b6bd9faa8cd6d6c724ff20b1af/139_84_4633_2779/master/4633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb24680eef88c4d027d2b495d68aca09","title":"labour leadership contest young members","story":"Many under-30s are keen to see a change in direction after four defeats in a rowAs Labour heads into another leadership contest, it will be the votes of the party’s 550,000 members that will matter most in the end. They will have the final say after a 12-week contest that will start next month.Since 2015, the membership has been strongly supportive of Jeremy Corbyn, and he won thumping majorities in 2015 and 2016 thanks largely to them. But after the recent catastrophic election defeat, Labour’s fourth in a row, are some losing patience? Do they want more Corbynism, or is the brand now tainted by failure?Shannon Jezzard, a 24-year-old Labour councillor in Harlow, Essex, is a member of the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement Momentum. She voted for Corbyn in the past two leadership elections.“I really liked his consistent voting record – opposing cuts and austerity – and felt like he was always on the right side of history, especially when it came to the Iraq war,” she says. Jezzard would like to see more Corbynism in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, a long-term ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as the next leader.“I think she’s a great candidate –she has good politics, but without the baggage of longer-standing MPs, and is genuinely likeable. I think it’d be good to get out of the London bubble and see someone lead the party from up north.”Backing Long Bailey for leader over Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry or Lisa Nandy might seem the obvious choice for Labour members who have previously supported Corbyn. The shadow business secretary has strong links with the union movement, whose endorsement will also be important in the forthcoming contest. However, other young members disagree.Jonny Lawrence, 25, a PhD student, backed Corbyn in the last two leadership contests but encountered hostility towards him in the general election campaign. “I canvassed loads for Anneliese Dodds in Oxford East and the main issue coming up on the doorstep for us was Corbyn as a leader. It was difficult – I lost faith in him myself, to be honest,” he says.Lawrence is now leaning towards Nandy, a candidate who has forged an identity and a message entirely separate from Corbyn and his allies.“I do think she was right on Brexit and how we need to go about rebuilding the party,” he says. “Our focus needs to be, as she has said, on restoring faith in the towns across the UK that Labour can provide a better future for.“In reality, the manifesto’s flagship policies were out of touch and were much more appealing to me and my demographic than the demographic we needed to win.”Since the beginning of the election campaign, Labour membership has risen by more than 50,000. Georgina Holden, 22, is one of those who has joined up. She left the party in mid-2019 before rejoining shortly after the exit poll was published on election night because she wanted a say over who should take Labour forward. “I wanted to make sure that I get a say in who leads the party out of the abyss. I knew that the membership would most likely vote for the Corbyn continuity candidate, and I wanted to stop that from happening,” she says.“I’m not going to vote for a candidate seen as Corbyn 2.0. The media gives Labour leaders a hard enough time as it is, and we need to combat that. To elect a continuity candidate would be to tell the electorate we’ve learned nothing.”Phe Hayhurst, a 19-year-old student from Reading, has been a Labour member since 2015. She voted for Corbyn in both leadership elections. But now she’s backing Keir Starmer because, she says, he is “best placed to bring the party back together” and is “not too closely aligned with any faction of the party, and comes across well in public and in the House of Commons”.Francine Mead, a 22-year old working in public affairs, has also been a Labour member since 2015 and previously backed Yvette Cooper (in 2015) and then Jeremy Corbyn (in 2016).For her Starmer also looks the best on offer. “There is no point in a main political party existing under first-past-the-post if it cannot win elections. I’ve wanted Starmer to stand as leader for quite some time now.”“He hasn’t pandered to factions, he doesn’t let himself be defined by iniduals – he just does his job with passion and respect.”Since the summer of 2015, a majority of Labour members have been solidly in favour of project Corbyn.Now it seems some believe it is time for change, and that the worst reaction to the election result would be just more of the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75d979e61e6b55514d4aa25b9fcf460792fce53/0_426_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82c72e142c9898ca25ea4985d297a5e","title":"if you speak multiple languages which words get lost in translation","story":"Share your favourite words or terms that just don’t translateA new study has demonstrated that while words for emotions such as “fear”, “love” or “anger” are often directly translated between languages, there can be differences in their true meaning, depending on the family the language belongs to.For example, while the concept of “love” is closely linked to “like” and “want” in Indo-European languages, it is more closely associated with “pity” in Austronesian languages.The team behind the research say the way particular experiences are interpreted as emotions appears to be shaped by culture.Are there words you know which can be directly translated, yet have subtle differences in meaning?

In total, Biles won five gold medals out of the six medal events in Stuttgart, clinching the team competition and all around finals, before dominating the vault, beam and floor event finals. She is now the most decorated gymnast of all time at world championships with 25 medals across five competitions.One of the greatest difficulties of watching a niche, complex sport such as gymnastics is deciphering the difference between two routines that are usually separated in the scoring by only tenths. But Biles flew higher than the rest of the field, with tighter form and bigger skills. She is so much better than every other gymnast in the world that she makes the sport easy to watch.However, Biles’s victory carries greater significance than medals. Three years ago, she departed the Olympic games in Rio with four gold medals and a bronze. She had been the best gymnast in the world for four straight years in a sport that is normally too difficult and unpredictable for sustained dominance. As she inched closer to the Olympics, the hype surrounding her became impossible to escape. When her Olympic prospects were discussed, the question wasn’t whether she would win but whether it was possible for her to fail badly enough to lose. The pressure could have easily suffocated her. After she won her third straight all-around gold at the 2015 worlds, Biles spoke about her achievement as if she had lost ownership of it to the hype: “I was just glad that it was finally over and everybody got their three-peat. Everyone could finally put that out in the paper,” she told Buzzfeed.Throughout the first years of Biles’s career, the Olympics were always the ultimate goal. Biles and her then coach, Aimee Boorman, countered the risks of failure in Rio by promoting consistency throughout the Games. She was already miles ahead of the other competitors, so instead they focused only on choosing routines that were “easy” for her and were replicable on any given day, regardless of how much pressure she was under. They still happened to be more complex than those of any other gymnast in history.Since returning to the sport in 2018 after a post-Olympics sabbatical, Biles has hired new coaches – Laurent and Cecile Landi – and the 2019 worlds were a reflection of their new philosophy. In lieu of any competitive rivals, they decided that the healthiest way to keep her motivated after achieving her dreams was to remove those constraints and to test her own strength, seeing how far she can push the sport in the process.Throughout the summer, footage of Biles was disseminated to all corners of the internet simply due to the sheer audacity of the skills she was attempting. She became the first woman in history to land a triple-double (triple-twisting double somersault) in the floor exercise and the first person to compete a double-double dismount on beam – two skills that gymnastics fans had dreamed of seeing but never imagined would come to fruition.Many gymnasts can throw huge skills with their legs flailing and form deteriorating, but what sets Biles apart is that her technique makes even the most difficult skills look so tidy and easy. The few times Biles has stepped out of bounds on her triple-double, it has been because she overpowered the skill. It’s difficult to know if she has even reached her limit yet.By landing both skills to her feet in Stuttgart, they became her own. She now has four elements named after her in the gymnastics code of points. Each time she nailed them throughout the week, her smile was as wide as the five times she stood on the podium with a gold medal around her neck. She says that she took more joy from gaining ownership of those elements than winning her medals. It makes sense. She has already won more than she could have ever imagined, but now her name is indelibly written into the rules of gymnastics four times. Now her legacy is complete.No occupation in sport is as ephemeral as a female gymnast’s career. Most peak in the middle of their teenage years before puberty gradually complicates their battle with gravity. It is tough for gymnastics to build a worldwide following when it changes hands so frequently and the public cannot build a relationship with its top athletes.Perhaps the greatest reflection of Biles’s talent is that she has been able to bypass those limitations to enjoy a healthy, fulfilling career and her success has allowed her to build the following she deserves. When her videos flit across social networks, gaining hundreds of thousands of likes, it is because of the excellence of her ability rather than the number of Swarovski crystals on her leotard.Biles has developed as a gymnast with each year and at 22 is better than she has ever been. Away from the gym, she has grown from a wide-eyed teenager into a grown woman who is outspoken and bold. It is not normal for gymnastics to be part of any general sporting conversation in a non-Olympic year, but Biles’s enduring greatness has made it essential."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a403f4580fbbbab4863f15ba0d4ed60809a0322/640_446_3558_2135/master/3558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4248f1ef8e39cdf89223fa7f74e79115","title":"martin peters a life in pictures","story":"England’s 1966 World Cup-winning midfielder Martin Peters has died aged 76.

With old-school charm and thrills, it’s like The Greatest Showman minus the pop songs, although the soundtrack here is just as fundamental. Evan Jolly’s score sews together a dozen disparate routines with its grandiose, button-pushing drama cueing every ooh and ahh.David Williamson is the avuncular ringmaster and occasionally slightly inappropriate uncle ho sets about gently ribbing the kids who come up on stage to be stooges in routines mixing groan-worthy comedy, magic and nostalgic sentimentality.Skill abounds across the cast, even if not every act wows, and they are all eclipsed by the elephants – life-sized puppets full of grace and character. Still, the humans bring surprises too. When it said in the programme there’d be foot juggling, I assumed they’d be juggling objects, but actually it’s people: one man tossed in circles by the toes of another.Other highlights include the most contorted contortionist I’ve certainly ever seen, Senayet Asefa Amare, whose impossibly twisted torso generates a mix of awe and ickiness. There’s more stomach-flipping in the wheel of death, like a giant fidget spinner-turned-hamster wheel hoisted above the stage, in which two men essentially attempt to outrace the laws of physics.Audiences today aren’t the entertainment-starved folk who rolled up to the big top in 1903. In a culture saturated with special effects, juggling an extra club or balancing for a few more seconds doesn’t excite. It is the moments of connection, creativity and wonder that matter.There’s real artistry in the aerialism of Daria Shelest and Vadym Pankevych, their “we’re so in love” schtick translating into heady rushes of movement, Shelest swooping up the hanging silk and into her partner’s arms. And when utterly fearless acrobat Maria Boldyreva dons a blindfold to be swung, tossed and, crucially, caught at great height by Ivan Fomichev, for a moment the music cuts to silence. We’re left with only the audience’s gasps as the soundtrack – and that is the best theatre of the night.At the Royal Festival Hall, London, until 5 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45f88e77e3387e42ff5503f369e188d6c37523b1/0_533_4397_2638/master/4397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4fc30f8ef80c7b9aa53075d24af824","title":"craig revel horwood strictly christmas special panto interview","story":"Born in Ballarat, Australia, Craig Revel Horwood, 54, began his career as a dancer in Melbourne but moved to the UK 30 years ago to work in London’s West End. He’s now a choreographer, director and stage star but is best known as a judge on all 17 series of Strictly Come Dancing. He’s appearing in pantomime at Manchester Opera House until 29 December.You’re currently playing the Wicked Queen in Snow White. How wicked is she?Very wicked but she’s funny with it. There are a lot of Strictly gags in there, where my dancing gets scored by the audience. Sometimes they shout “Seveeeeen!” like Len Goodman, other times I get a whole row of zeros. There’s lots of singing, frivolity, banter with hecklers and costume changes. It’s so full-on, I usually lose a stone-and-a-half during panto season.You should patent the Panto Diet Plan.I should. You can eat anything you like over the Christmas period and still lose weight – what’s not to love?How are you enjoying spending the month in Manchester?I adore Manchester. It’s got fantastic places to eat and great nightlife. It’s like a mini-London, except easy to get around. I’ve spent lots of time here with Annie, Sister Act and the Strictly tour. I directed the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony here too.This is your 12th year doing panto. Are you booked up for next Christmas?I’m booked up for the next three, actually. Hopefully I’ve got another three years in me! Next year it’s Cinderella in Southampton. I’m the Wicked Stepmother, obviously.You’re also off on your first solo tour next year, titled All Balls and Glitter. What can audiences expect?I’m really looking forward to it. I’ll showcase songs from some of the musicals I’ve been in, do a bit of dancing and tell some stories. I’ll also share some backstage gossip because I’m always opening my mouth. A bit too wide sometimes.What did you think of the standard on Strictly this year?Really high – and unpredictable, too. I would’ve put a big bet on Michelle Visage getting to the final but she went out in Blackpool. All it took was one weak routine.Head judge Shirley Ballas said she received more online abuse this year than ever…She can join my club, darling. I’ve had that for 15 years. Everyone’s entitled to their opinion, of course, but there’s never any need for that. I tend to just look at how many followers trolls have got and it’s usually about two, so please. You can’t let it bother you.There were lots of injuries this series. Is that because the dances are becoming more adventurous?That’s part of it. Because the competition is so strong, they’re pushing themselves further each year and trying harder to impress. But accidents can happen anytime. I’ve ripped my calf muscle walking down stairs and slipped a disc leaning across the bed to pick up some washing, but I’ve always been fine when I’m dancing.Injuries led to Kelvin Fletcher being drafted in as a replacement and going on to win…Well, hello. God works in mysterious ways. He’s definitely a worthy winner. He came in at the last minute but had a strong work ethic, great temperament and he can really dance.You sometimes say dancers have “spatulistic” hands. Is that a word you made up?Yes! Hands like spatulas. And arm-ography – that was one of mine that is now in the dictionary, hilariously.You used to be a drag queen back in Australia. What do you think of drag being so fashionable now?It does seem to be having a moment. It certainly wasn’t this mainstream in my day. I’d finish a theatre show, then grab my trumpet, tap shoes and backing tapes, then go off to the clubs. There’s a long history in the UK of comedy drag acts with almost clown-style makeup, but I always tried to fool everyone I was a woman. I was 6ft 5in in heels but one has fantasies when one is young.Which celebrity would you most like to see on Strictly?Simon Cowell, definitely. I’d love an X Factor does Strictly crossover with all their judges. Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh would be brilliant too. Nicole Scherzinger or Cheryl Cole would probably win it, because they’re fierce dancers.Who are you looking forward to seeing back on the dancefloor for the Strictly Christmas special?I’m a great fan of Debbie McGee so it’ll be fantastic to see her again. The Christmas special is always fun. Everyone at home can sit down to watch their favourites and relax after a great big porky lunch. There’s nothing like it to add a bit of glitz and glamour to proceedings.How much time off do you get over Christmas?Just Christmas Day, but that’ll be lovely. My boyfriend’s family live in Leicester so I’m going down there for Christmas lunch, then back to Manchester that night. I’ve got two shows on Boxing Day so I can’t be too outrageous. I couldn’t do the Wicked Queen with a hangover.Will you be throwing your traditional New Year’s Eve pool party?Absolutely. Get the neighbours round to watch the fireworks at midnight, then out come the bikinis and thongs and off we go. Jump in the pool, then party until dawn.

So we fed everything he says into an algorithm, built a Zuckerbot, and interviewed itMark Zuckerberg is press shy. The 35-year-old billionaire’s innate sense of swagger (“I’m CEO … bitch”) has failed to translate into confident public speaking. But after the Cambridge Analytica scandal precipitated a massive crisis of trust for the company, Zuckerberg was forced to step out of his comfort zone and start answering for himself and his company.In the year and a half since the story broke in the Observer, Zuckerberg has testified before the US Congress twice and sat for interviews with the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, Wired, Recode and Vox – everyone, it has seemed, except the .So since Zuckerberg won’t speak to the , we built a Zuckerbot that will.We worked with Botnik Studios, the team behind Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash, to create a predictive keyboard trained on Zuckerberg’s interviews, speeches, blogposts and testimony from the last three years – more than 200,000 words of Zuckerverbiage in all.  and Observer journalists then provided the questions, and Botnik used the Zuckerbot to produce the answers.The result is this exclusive interview, which we feel confident is more revealing of the man behind Facebook than anything else you’ll read this year.Hi Mark, thanks so much for agreeing to talk with the . Let’s jump right into our questions. You gave a major speech this year about how important it is that Facebook “gives people voice”. How does Facebook give people a voice, Mark?First, I want to thank you all for being a part of my mission. The purpose of Facebook is to bring about internet for people in the digital room. It is about advertising dollars to people who pay to be able to pay. We believe in building $8bn of voice on the platform for dads who are hungry for coffee.Do you think that Facebook has made the world a better place?Facebook is a happy version of what I am. I am pretty pro people and um … I am definitely strongly about baseball consumption. Friends, we can do better than banning misinformation and dancing in the air. I want to capture the good news here in California: people are clicking on Facebook until they love it.What would you do if someone presented you with irrefutable evidence that Facebook is bad for the world?Here is what I can assure you: if you think Facebook is a force for Facebook, you will be curated offline and our friends will help you remove bad speech from your preferences.This has been a big year for thinking about how Facebook affects democracy. Do you believe in democracy?I believe in a dream of purpose and hope. I actually believe it is inspiring for everyone to be an entrepreneur. But also for me to be an intermediary between people and the future of the internet.There’s been a lot of talk this year about billionaires. Do you think billionaires should exist?I am a lot more than a huge amount of money. I am a bunch of stuff, which means that if I don’t exist any more, there’s no one else to make sure we’ve got this computer to do everything from governance to research. And is that the internet for me? Is that the internet for everyone? I guess we’ll get to decide that in the future.What did you talk about with Trump at your secret dinner?Is anything ever secure? Is anything ever secret? Guess what? The answer is a clear maybe. Or maybe not. I am going to say quiet words in your face just like I did with him and Congress. You can’t expect me to tell you a secret that I didn’t share with him but I am confident that we are sharing the same infrastructure.Tell us what you really think about Elizabeth Warren.I asked my wife for first-hand information about what I think about women. She told me she is a really good person, a girl for all girls, full of ideas and culture, ability and safety tools for helping kids get out of a building. Do I like her more than the men candidates? She is not the wealthiest, which is OK but kinda weighs on volunteers.What’s your favorite thing about Pete Buttigieg?He is basically a walking mop for political discourse. When he comes home, you can be confident that you have about one hundred seconds to share some thoughts on governments, or you simply will get blocked.Facebook is now more than 15 years old. Did you ever think when you were coming up with Facebook in your … Sorry, remind me where you were when you came up with Facebook?I was in the digital world of VR, and I started to explore a little room with a lot of Facebook groups, and I just remember sitting in one of them and deciding to make a new Facebook for some people who I like.Back in that room, did you ever think that you would be implicated by the United Nations in a campaign of ethnic cleansing?A major saying in our little office was that you don’t need a big responsibility to make a power. We can do a full audit of our lives to help build more meaningful social attacks. And that is the way we operate. It’s a tradeoff, because we prefer to be a surprise, but we also need to keep building things that people already have.My colleague Carole Cadwalladr asked me to ask you this: when did you and Sheryl Sandberg first learn about Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting activities?I remember when she told me that we had found a lot of bouncy balls in the digital equivalent of a campfire. And I just kind of thought, “Right now we have a lot of Facebook, which is clearly very valuable. So we need to do things.” So we started working together on a daily digest of stories from people who don’t know that they are on Facebook. We saw more than 200 million hours of video, and it was easy to deliver.How do you think about your responsibility to limit the spread of misinformation on your website?I don’t believe in Germany. Does that need to be fact-checked?Would you still be positioning Facebook as an alternative to Chinese censorship if your charm offensive with Xi Jinping had worked and he’d let you into the country?When I look around at all the friendships I can build for augmented leaders, I just have an intense and spiritual experience. I feel completely naked, and I have access to more information than 30,000 million per cent of the internet.I know that I need to build a classifier to get access to whatever data I think up – it may be closely connected to the question of whether anyone is really important – and then I actually … I just post on the internet of time, which is a monolithic thing, and I am so far away, and I am happy, and I am one dimension of content prone to insight, outrage and, increasingly, to self-think.Remember when you traveled around the country meeting regular people?If you look at the word “everyone”, you can see that it has a part about all of us and a really important part about one. I am a person. I feel really big. But I am so focused on everyone.Tell the truth – were you planning to run for president?I have an obligation to be interesting to the audience. I have no tolerance for being incepted and convinced that I am a photo. I really love to make decisions about people. I guess I am definitely on the team of the people.What is the largest animal you have ever stunned with a taser before butchering?A lot of people agree that it was a big bear with a rare disorder called too much electricity in the blood, but it was actually the biggest bird in the world, and now I am the most important part of our ecosystem.Final question: should we trust you?I recently uncovered a physical plaque that could potentially be about a billion years old and it already generates about one million hours of video content passively overnight.

Until the devastating 1986 EastEnders episode in which the Queen Vic’s landlord Den Watts chose Christmas Day to drop orce papers on his wife, most TV Christmas specials were innocuous. Chas \u0026amp Dave around the old Joanna. Ronnie Corbett in a Christmas sweater. Now, Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without an aeroplane crashing into a pub and maiming half a dozen beloved soap stalwarts. From last year’s devastatingly bleak Call the Midwife to the routinely wanton carnage of Emmerdale, if it bleeds, it leads.In truth, Christmas has always been darker than might be imagined. Originally, it dovetailed with the festival of Saturnalia, a wild bacchanalia in which criminals ran amok and gift-giving was simply a means of avoiding violent robbery. Meanwhile, mistletoe was prized by the Druids as an infertility cure – which gives a slightly queasy aspect to its modern status as the office flirt’s favourite vascular shrub. Over the years, we’ve filtered out most of this stuff replaced it with chocolate and tinsel. But maybe some atavistic traces remain in our desire to see misery materialising on our TVs over the festive period.The role of television has changed, too. Back in the 1970s, there were three channels, one of which – in the paternalistic interests of Public Service Broadcasting – would often be treating us to four hours of opera, even on Christmas Day. If they wanted to avoid having to talk to their relatives, viewers couldn’t afford to be picky. Now, choice proliferates, and Christmas TV has become an arms race, with ratings wars reported as news stories.“Audiences used to be passive vessels,” says media studies academic Tina Dixon. “That moved to them being more active. A sense arose not of what media does to audiences but what audiences do to media.” Hence, the Christmas special as distraction, escape and as catharsis.To illustrate, Dixon cites Uses and Gratification Theory, a means of analysing why and how people use specific media to satisfy specific needs. Soaps are a perfect example. We displace difficult emotions that surface in the overheated atmosphere of Christmas. Through TV, we express them vicariously. If we don’t, it can spell trouble. “Christmas can be difficult for a lot of people,” she says, “and that sense of having an outlet to cry over a tragic storyline is important. It chimes with people who are not having a picture-perfect Christmas. I can’t imagine that’s lost on media producers.”So, a feedback loop was born. If audiences have helped escalate this, then the makers of television have responded in kind. Think of the demise of Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey’s 2012 special – a moment seemingly calibrated with the sole intention of making your mum cry. The utterly berserk Casualty@Holby City crossover of 2004 was essentially a maximalist game of Christmas TV bingo, managing to incorporate a fuel-tanker crash, a hostage crisis, an explosion, a fire, a sick child and of course, a drunk, grubby Santa wandering around the hospital.If it seems strange that shows as habitually subtle and nuanced as Casualty and Holby City would resort to such shock tactics, once again, there is a simple explanation. “Soaps have traditionally been targeted at women,” says Dixon. “At Christmas, there’s a sense of wanting to be more inclusive in terms of the rest of the audience. So these storylines might be an attempt to attract men and young people. There’s an expectation that dark storylines might tap into those viewers.”Of course, received wisdom has it that we just don’t sit down and watch TV together any more. This too might help explain the dark melodrama of Christmas telly. These specials are billed as “events”, hopefully replete with shocking, gossip-worthy resolutions. With that comes the sense that if you don’t watch at the same time as your nearest and dearest, there’s no point watching at all. In that sense, festive TV misery might be read as an appeal to our still discernible desire to experience things collectively.But is this TV trope under threat? While 2019’s offerings promise the traditional bloodbaths – both Coronation Street and EastEnders are teasing significant body counts – perhaps the hits of the season will be found elsewhere. And chances are, they will be dark. The fragmentation allowed by multiple channels and streaming services has facilitated the next evolutionary step in Christmas TV misery. It was over Christmas 2015 that Netflix’s bleakly addictive Making a Murderer really took flight. Perhaps there is a message there for makers of Christmas TV: you can only push dark melodrama so far before viewers start sneaking off in search of the real thing.Silent Night (1990)This Steven Berkoff adaptation tracks a lonely misanthrope’s descent into madness and depression. Harry (Berkoff) counts his Christmas cards (he’s got six, if you count one from an insurance company), agonises over contacting friends and ponders suicide. It doesn’t get repeated very often.The West Wing: Noël (2000)Festive PTSD anyone? Proving that US dramas can ladle on the gloom too, this episode explores White House spad Josh Lyman’s trauma after involvement in the case of a suicidal Air Force pilot. Just in case that’s too much of a downer, there’s a subplot about Nazi collaborators in second world war France.Casualty@Holby (2004)A metatextual exercise in which two dramas collide with the searing velocity of a lorry careering into an orphanage. As the carnage unfolds, an offscreen voice asks: “Can this get any worse?”. It’s unclear whether this is a question about the situation or a request to ramp the gloom up further. It works either way.Black Mirror: White Christmas (2014)So grim it’s almost comical.

Here are the top Christmas gifts to look out for when you next pop in to a thrift shopAs shopping, and living, sustainably becomes a focus for more and more people, this Christmas is the perfect time to turn to your local charity shops for your festive shopping. Not only will you give what you buy a new lease of life, you’ll support your local economy and share the benefits of shopping secondhand. To give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up the best gifts you can expect to find in your local charity shop.Winter warmersFrom oversized turtlenecks in fun primary colours to neat cardigans and always-appropriate V-necks, charity shops are a goldmine for knitwear, particularly around the time wardrobes are being cleared to make way for (carefully pre-specified) Christmas gifts. Let their castoffs become your festive finds. You’ll save pounds compared with what you would spend on a new item and you’re more likely to find something unique, so your giftee won’t have to worry about running into someone else wearing the same thing.Board gamesChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without a good board game to bring everyone together or, indeed, ide them … Monopoly and Scrabble are mainstays in most charity shops but there’s plenty others to suit everyone. Take your pick from the likes of Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo, as well as a plethora of TV- and film-themed games and the latest releases.Bestselling booksAlongside some wonderfully weird 1970s recipe books, you’ll find scores of bestselling titles on charity shop bookshelves. Zadie Smith, Margaret Atwood, Philip Pullman and John Grisham are all regulars, and you’ll find plenty of new authors such as Sally Rooney and David Chariandy too. While some titles may be a few years old, it’s not unusual to find the latest must-read on the shelves, and keep your eyes peeled for signed editions for an extra-special touch.Chintzy chinaFrom cocktails served in teacups to unusual teapots becoming a major home decor trend, the popularity of chintzy, vintage china is on the rise. You’ll discover shelves worth of it in almost any charity shop you walk into. It’s the perfect gift for someone who likes their homeware kitsch. Why not use a floral teacup as a holder for a homemade candle?Classic recordsWith vinyl records increasing in popularity, why not make a beeline for your nearest charity shop as they have plenty on offer. As digital formats took over, people turned to charity shops to free up their once-straining shelves and, because vinyl was donated in such abundance, many charity shops sell records for as little as 25p. You can expect to find everything from classical and krautrock to electronica and soul.Brand-new clothesWe all know someone who’s a little squeamish about the idea of secondhand clothes. But luckily for thrifty gift-givers, charity shops are not only stocked with vintage finds and pre-loved pieces, they’re also home to a huge amount of brand-new, unworn clothes. A quick rifle through the rails of your local charity shop will reveal a whole host of clothes with the original tags still attached. You’ll find everything from bold, printed T-shirts and floaty maxi dresses to jeans and shirts. There’s an abundance of high street labels waiting to be found and, if you’re lucky, you might just stumble across a designer piece.Vintage sewing patternsMore than a million people have taken up sewing over the past few years, with sales of sewing patterns soaring. However, with some patterns costing as much as we’re used to paying for a fully finished garment, the prices involved can be off-putting. To keep the crafty person in your life stitching, have a rifle through the baskets of vintage sewing patterns you often find tucked away underneath shelves. Selling for as little as 50p, you could buy enough to keep them busy until next Christmas.Statement jewelleryYou don’t have to go to an expensive boutique to find the perfect piece of jewellery – there’s plenty to be found in charity shops and they won’t break the bank. Take your pick from delicate vintage brooches, strings of pearls (likely faux, but you never know), oversized earrings, watches and cufflinks. The shelves are full to bursting with an assortment of jewellery that will suit everyone from your best friend to your grandma.Toiletry gift setsOnce a reasonably priced option for a secret Santa, toiletry gift sets seem to get more and more expensive each year. Rather than splashing out, see what’s on offer in your local charity shop. While some people may be worried about buying lotions and potions secondhand, charity shops are very savvy with their stock. Anything opened doesn’t make the shelves and many branches keep high street gift guides from the last couple of years in stock so they can cross-check whether a set is in date or not.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/2810_672_2638_1583/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=641c6a1f2409434d9c09472aa8a21693","title":"weve become like a little family of shops we look out for one another","story":"For Karen Harvey, her shop Hoos is fulfilling a lifelong passion for Scandi design while also breathing welcome new life into her local area, writes  Malcolm Jack “I often get people coming in and asking me what the name of the shop means,” smiles Karen Harvey, founder and owner of Hoos. “Everyone thinks it’s Danish or something. It’s actually just how you say ‘house’ in Scotland,” she laughs, “it’s just a bit of fun.”Be that as it may, it’s a name that captures a lot about what makes Glasgow’s haven of gorgeous Nordic homeware such a unique delight to visit. Both in terms of its synergy of fine Scandi and Scottish design (“hus”, pronounced the same way as Hoos, happens to be the word for “house” in the three main Scandinavian languages), and also its welcoming sense of warmth and character. Never more so than in the run-up to Christmas, when Harvey and her staff embrace the rich northern European tradition of bringing cosy light and comfort to long, dark winter nights, with their twinkling decorations and friendly, personalised approach to helping customers pick just the right presents for family and friends.Home has been at the heart of 63-year-old Harvey’s entire working life, in different ways. For 30 years she lived in Suffolk, leading two charities that did revolutionary things in improving the lives, living circumstances and futures of vulnerable young people (she received an MBE for her services). A mixture of professional and personal circumstances led her back to her native Glasgow a few years ago, where she decided to take an entirely new career direction.“I’ve always had an interest in interiors and design, even though that’s not my background at all,” Harvey explains. “Scandinavian design has always been my sort of personal aesthetic, so when I was thinking: ‘OK, what brands do I want to do?’ they were the only ones for me.” She leased small premises on, at that time, a dilapidated stretch of Great Western Road, just off the west end of Glasgow’s central artery Byres Road, and with the support of her architect partner Bill, cleverly transformed the compact space into an immaculately laid out, bright and inviting oasis of select hard and soft furnishings, cool kitchen and tableware, lush green house plants, stylish rainwear, handmade fashion accessories and other assorted pretty things.Starting a new business in a new sector would be a daunting challenge for anyone, but Harvey took it in her stride. “I had to go to Copenhagen and be interviewed by some of the brands, because they’re very particular about what kind of shops they’re going in to,” Harvey reveals. She evidently impressed, because Hoos has become one of the few stockists in the UK for a host of hip makers such as Hay, Normann Copenhagen and Skagerak, to name just a few. “Most of my jewellery is by Glasgow School of Art graduates,” Harvey explains. “We also do textiles by Scottish makers. You’re not going to find these kinds of things in any other store either.”Business is going strong for Hoos, as it helps lead a local high street revival. Harvey is passionate about fostering a thriving community along Great Western Road, which has seen a host of great vintners, victuallers, boutiques, bookshops, bakers and cafes breathe new life into a historic strip of retail premises. She’s involved with Love Great Western Road, a Business Improvement District (BID) proposal encouraging local businesses to work collectively for a brighter, more prosperous commercial future. “It’s helped us to get to know one another,” Harvey says of BID. “We’ve become like a little family of shops – we look out for one another.”As well as local retailers pulling together to support each other, they all rely on their customers doing the same. By reminding people #WhereYouShopMatters, Visa is championing local, independent retailers to help restore richly deserved focus and footfall to our high streets. Not only because our high streets are at the heart of our communities, but also because great independent traders can offer unique and enriching retail experiences, where staff take a hands-on approach to helping you select special things for yourself and for the important people in your life. Shops like Hoos are working hard to not only redefine what it means to be a small, independent trader in the digital age, but also help revitalise our high streets for a new generation, and they deserve to be shouted about for it.“I’m really encouraged by Visa’s #WhereYouShopMatters initiative,” says Hoos’s Karen Harvey, “because it brings businesses like ours to people’s attention. Particularly among younger people, who I think are the ones who increasingly do most of their shopping online. If it brings Hoos to their attention for maybe the first time, obviously that’s fab. And then they’ll come to Great Western Road more often and see all the other fabulous shops too.”Here are some of Harvey’s top tips for great Christmas shopping experiences in her local area:Love and Squalor“A small shop just past Kelvinbridge. Rebecca is the owner and she sells clothes that she handmakes herself. So it’s like going back to how it used to be many years ago. She also buys in things such as wonderful socks and lovely Irish scarves, blankets and candles. It’s just a really nice experience going in there.”427 Great Western Road, Kelvinbridge, G4 9JACottonrake Bakery“A fabulous independent bakery, doing wonderful bread, cakes and bakes. In the run-up to Christmas they do all kinds of special things such as Christmas jams and other nice little presents. We feel extremely lucky to have them nearby.”497 Great Western Road, G12 8HLPaulin Watches“Everyone loves a watch – particularly a handmade one. Paulin’s designs are beautiful. They’re a young, independent company and they sell lots of other handmade things such as risograph prints by local artists.”407 Great Western Road, G4 9JAShow your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f2c9a26f832b9957df0f178b0e25d1a45f8cdd/418_2114_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09930e09e9b7d6674f8445610cfea1b4","title":"the more festive the better how the high street becomes a special place at christmas","story":"Shopping takes on a new life at Christmas as the high street is transformed – as shoppers profess to having a little more goodwill than on your average Saturday and independent stores become the top destinationsAt the risk of sounding incredibly basic, I’ll confess: after the Christmas music, the decor is my favourite part of the festive season. While I’m next to useless when it comes to putting up my own decorations, I’m drawn like a moth to the flame to any household, restaurant, market or shop that has put in the extra effort. The more fake snow, twinkling lights and jingling bells, the better.In the car-centric Toronto suburb where I grew up, most of my youthful Christmas shopping was confined to the local mega-malls, which were unfailingly packed with overheated shoppers from Black Friday through to Boxing Day, so moving to the UK has been something of a revelation. No mall Santa, however rosy-cheeked, can really compete with the quaint holiday market in my boyfriend’s Lancashire hometown, or Kew Gardens’ festive trail of lights.That’s why you’re likely to find me gawping at the garlands over Regent Street when they’re illuminated later this month. The first major high street in London to adopt the practice of street-long decoration, Regent Street has been doing its Christmas light display since 1954, after a reporter described London as “drab” during the holiday season. Oxford Street followed suit soon after, in 1959, and by the end of the 1960s, high streets across Britain were invested in the new tradition. In fact, many cities now make an event of the day the lights are switched on, complete with fair rides, pantos and celebrities of varying degrees of fame.These spectacles aren’t just about dazzling onlookers. In Christmas and the British: A Modern History, historian Martin Johnes explains that light displays “gave 20th-century Christmas shopping a sense of occasion that differentiated it from the wider shopping experience that had become so embedded in everyday life”. More than just setting a mood, high street Christmas decorations make shopping less of a chore. If we have to endure the hordes each season, why not do it somewhere we don’t only tolerate, but enjoy?It’s not only the busy high streets following this logic. The coloured lights strung by volunteers in the tiny Cornish fishing village of Mousehole, all funded by donations, attract some 30,000 tourists a year to the benefit of local businesses. And for the last three years, Broadway Road in the Cotswolds has hosted late-night shopping evenings in December, with local stores staying open until 8:30pm so shoppers can stock up on gifts and take in a mix of performances in a cheerful environment. A friend of mine who worked at a Broadway Road hair salon recalls the time her team dolled up Three Wise Women and had them ride down the street on camels.Partial to a late-night browse myself, I usually venture to Mount Street in Mayfair to watch the lights get switched on, and spend the rest of the night wandering through the boutiques, sipping complimentary champagne and stuffing my face with mince pies to a medley of choristers and fashionable DJs. You can get the same buzz on many high streets in December, when independent shops stay open late and a holly wreath (or cup of mulled wine) is always close by.For all my talk about the high street at Christmas, I’m not one of those people who sorts out their list early. I pick up inspiration over the course of the year, and then do most of my shopping in the two weeks before the big day. That period, when the excitement around Christmas is reaching its peak, is when I feel most energised and most excited to take part in any Christmas-related activity, whether it’s ice-skating, eating Serrano ham at a friend’s flat or having one final night out before everyone goes home for the holidays. And in those instances, as with the shops, the more festive the environment, the better.Show your high street some loveWhy not seek out the personal touch with your Christmas shopping this year and join Visa in supporting local independent businesses across the country because #WhereYouShopMatters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e525b0332feb76a5bf0c6cec4c2d4182c912f808/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46b245b4df27768c21d59e0336fc7b10","title":"2010s decade that left us reeling","story":"In 2009, at the end of the decade for which no better name than the “noughties” was devised, a flurry of books appeared that attempted to make sense of the preceding 10 years. Most were overwhelmingly upbeat. Some bore signs that their final, more sober chapters had been late additions tagged on at the end so as to acknowledge the elephant in the room – that the decade had ended in the most severe economic contraction since 1929.In a little over a week, a second nameless decade will come to an end and the 2020s will begin. The list of upcoming books about the past 10 years appears to be short. Journalists and cultural historians, the sort of people who tend to write such titles, are, it seems, as bewildered as everyone else concussed by the political and cultural blast waves that detonated throughout the decade. Few are confident enough to think that, in their final moments, the 2010s can be neatly summed up in book form.Ninety years ago in the US, Frederick Lewis Allen, the editor-in-chief of Harper’s Magazine, coined a term for histories of the recent past written in the immediate aftermath. He called the genre “retrospective journalism” and was himself the author of one of its classics. Only Yesterday, Allen’s history of the 1920s, was published in 1931, having been written during the early stages of the Great Depression. It took its readers on a tour of a nation that no longer existed, the raucous, booming America of the “roaring 20s”.The one million Americans who bought Allen’s extraordinarily successful book were able to time-travel back to those yearned-for days of wealth and hedonism, and in part the book was little more than nostalgic comfort food, eagerly consumed by people struggling through the depression years. But Allen also reflected on the inequality and the violence of a decade that ended with an even more emphatic economic shock than that of the 2000s.Today, Only Yesterday is a largely forgotten book but it could well stand as a template for the type of books we are going to need to help us make sense of the 2010s.Allen began the book by asking his readers to imagine that “time were suddenly to turn back”, and they were to find themselves in the first years of the 1920s. In such circumstances, “what would seem strange” he asked?It’s a question worth asking again, in the dying days of 2019, from which the first years of the 2010s seem as distant and as alien as the early 20s appeared to the readers of Only Yesterday.The inherent lament within Allen’s title also feels apt in the last days of 2019 as it must have done in the early 1930s. After all, it was only yesterday that the great indictment against British politics was that it was dull and uninspiring. What concerned politicians and thinktanks back then was how disengaged from politics the public were becoming.Only yesterday Donald Trump was a reality TV star, Boris Johnson was the Tory’s in-house joker, and Facebook was just a way of tracking down old friends, rather than an existential threat to western liberal democracy.Only yesterday the prospect of Scottish independence seemed unlikely and that of a united Ireland utterly implausible.Only yesterday the Conservative and Unionist party regarded the maintenance of the union as a sacred duty, rather than something that might be surrendered in a political transaction to deliver another objective. Only yesterday we would have dismissed the idea that any single issue, particularly one that was merely the obsession of a tiny minority, could tear British society apart, rupture party loyalties and even damage familial bonds – how many of us are about to sit down to a fourth (and hopefully final) Christmas dinner eaten under a strictly enforced, seasonal ceasefire, a ban on any discussion of Brexit, to prevent inter-generational conflict from breaking out over the sprouts and turkey?Looking back just 10 years to 2010, it is difficult to understand how we got from there to here but it is easy to see why we are punch-drunk. Since the start of the 2010s we have had four elections, (2010, 2015, 2017, 2019), four prime ministers, seven governments and three referendums (Alternative Vote in 2011, Scottish Independence in 2014 and Brexit in 2016). There have been five Conservative administrations just since the end of the coalition.Back in 2010, people were still debating if Barack Obama’s presidency meant America was on the road to becoming a “post-racial society”. Now, at the decade’s close, we have become virtually anaesthetised to the fact that the current occupant of the White House feels able to describe white supremacists as “very fine people”.In 2011, we were swept along by the optimism of the Arab spring. In 2019, we watched from the sidelines as President Bashar al-Assad and his backers set about crushing what little is left of the Syrian revolution. The first years of the 2010s seem like a foreign country, a calmer, safer, more stable place where they do things differently.Partitioning music, fashion and youth culture into decades just about works. Everyone knows what you mean if you talk about 60s music or 80s fashion.Politics and economics, however, refuse to arrange themselves neatly into decades for our convenience, and at times our determination to ide history up into 10-year blocks distorts our view.It is tempting, given the results of this month’s election, to see the Conservative victory as an emphatic full stop, one that in the UK definitively marks the end of the 2010s.Future events will almost certainly complicate that picture. And it is easy to subconsciously catalogue the crash of 2008, and recession it sparked, as the last big event of the 2000s rather than the fundamental economic and political fact of the 2010s.Recessions and depressions, unlike financial crashes, are not events but processes. They take years to resolve, so just as the reverberations of the Wall Street crash were playing out in the lives of the people who read Only Yesterday, the consequences of 2008 and governmental responses to it were the great seismic forces rumbling under the surface of the 2010s.Perhaps the ultimate inequality in a decade defined by growing ergence in incomes and experience was how the effects of the crash and the great recession were so unequally distributed.For millions of people who lived through the 2010s, there was effectively no recovery from the crash. Their incomes never returned to pre-2008 levels.The austerity policies of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, which came to power just five months after the start of the decade, made things worse. As did the increasing casualisation of the labour market.The zero-hours uberisation of employment seemed, in some parts of the country, to turn most jobs into McJobs, not just low paid but insecure in ways that a Victorian dockworker could relate to. In parts of the UK, the combination of recession, austerity and long-term under-investment resulted in these places being seen as “left behind”, one of the new terms of the late 2010s.Little surprise then that so many people were in the market for a new type of politics.Only yesterday, populism was a term mainly encountered by history students doing courses on the 20th century. Ten years on and Trump has tested most of America’s “checks and balances” to near destruction. And he is just one figure among a global axis of nationalist leaders who emerged in the 2010s. In 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan became president of Turkey, the same year Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party came to power in India. The 2010s ended with Jair Bolsonaro joining the club as president of Brazil.The politics of extremes tapped into deepening insecurity, and was enabled by disarray on the left, but it metastasised through technologies whose full potential we had not fully appreciated in 2010.Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, we were still being told in 2010 that the web and social media had brought us to the threshold of a new and almost utopian society.The analogue autocrats of the world would be toppled in “Twitter Revolutions” led by demonstrators who coordinated their marches and their protests using Facebook and Twitter.In 2011, this sort of delusional optimism inflected much of the reporting of the Arab spring. For a few months, North Africa and the Middle East were viewed by cyber-utopianists as vast field laboratories in which the democratising and revolutionary potential of social media was to be empirically demonstrated.The facts on the ground, however, always suggested otherwise. Any delusions that the web represents an irresistible force for democratisation, any suggestion that the new technology was by its very nature on the side of liberal democracy withered to dust over these past 10 years.Not only was the role of Twitter and Facebook in the Arab spring enormously exaggerated, it was demonstrated, later in the 2010s, that the new technology used by demonstrators worked just as well when placed in the hands of autocrats and state security forces.The hit movie of 2010 was Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher’s Oscar-winning biopic The Social Network, which dramatised the troubled relationships between the founders of Facebook. What in 2010 seemed like a strangely dark take on a then celebrated phenomenon feels in 2019 like a prescient foreshadowing of a decade that was to come – a decade that ended with Cambridge Analytica, Putin’s troll armies and Mark Zuckerberg called to appear before a congressional committee to defend his company.To round the 2010s off perfectly, Sorkin earlier this year wrote an open letter to Zuckerberg in which he condemned Facebook’s refusal to fact-check political advertisements, a policy that Sorkin said led to “crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together”.We enter the 2020s free from any delusions about social media as the ally of democracy. Instead, we are asking a question that would have been unimaginable in 2010 – is social media, in its current form, actually inimical to the workings of liberal democracy?When the 2010s are too distant for retrospective journalism and are handed over to the historians, there is one key statistic that could determine their analysis.The decade might well come to be seen as one of history’s pivotal periods, not because it was the most isive or unstable – the 20th century alone has several decades that would be stronger contenders for those titles.Instead, the past 10 years might be most definitively marked as the decade in which the climate crisis reached a point of extreme urgency.The year ends with swaths of the Australian bush in flames and the Amazon blackened from earlier conflagrations. Everywhere are signs of ecological collapse, habitat loss, adaptive behaviours and mass extinction.Only yesterday we had an opportunity – perhaps our last – to change course. In the flurry of events and in the face of constant distraction, we let our attention be drawn elsewhere.That failure is one that future generations will struggle to understand, or forgive.A decade ago, electric vehicles were poised to whisk us silently and smoothly around our cities, replacing dirty motors with a new generation of technologically sophisticated smart cars. In fact, the bottom fell out of the car market altogether. Sales dropped to pre-2008 levels as millennials turned their backs on cars, be they electric or petrol-powered. Instead, the electric bike came to represent a shift to healthier, more sustainable, low-tech, low-impact transport. Ebikes became a non-car solution to our car problems. The pundits were right: it’s an electric vehicle, just with two wheels instead of four. Martin LoveGame of ThronesHBO’s adaptation of George RR Martin’s bestselling fantasy series bestrode the global television landscape from 2011 to its end earlier this year. Along the way, it became the most illegally downloaded TV show of all time, a drama adored by presidents and rappers alike, which, in its first seasons at least, provided some of the biggest shocks ever seen on the small screen. It ended with more of a whimper than a bang thanks to a isive final season. Sarah Hughes At the beginning of the decade, the 2010 Nobel physics prize was awarded to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov ‘for ground-breaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene’. Suddenly, everyone was talking about a material made of a single lattice layer of carbon atoms that had remarkable abilities to transmit heat and electricity while also being extremely strong. Suggested applications include improved camera sensors, DNA sequencing, gas sensing, material strengthening, and water desalination. To date, none of these ideas has been turned into devices but it took two centuries of work with silicon before engineers got the full potential out of that material. Robin McKie This was the decade when we became obsessed with taking 10,000 steps a day. According to science, the health benefits are moot but that didn’t stop Silicon Valley firms like Fitbit and Garmin coaxing us into wearing fitness trackers packed with accelerometers and sensors. These data-harvesting devices track our locations, our heart rates, our sleeping patterns and our exercise habits. Who gets the most use from this torrent of data – iniduals or the ‘data industrial complex’- is debatable. Ian TuckerIt was the object that came to represent the culture wars in the restaurant world throughout the decade that drew the line between content and style. It didn’t matter that many chefs just thought it made a nice change from the plate. The roof slate as food serving item became a hate object. In 2010, during a review of a Sheffield restaurant, I merely referred to it as a “serving slate” as if that were a thing. By 2015, when the hugely successful Twitter account We Want Plates was launched specifically to mock dismal non-plate serving items, the slate had come to represent all that was wrong with over-wrought food presentation. It’s still out there. I was served a dessert on one only a few weeks ago. But now the digital eye-roll is guaranteed. Jay RaynerAfter Lena Dunham sent up the concept in Girls, you’d think we’d be wary of calling anyone ‘the voice of a generation’ – yet it happened with Sally Rooney. The Irish writer’s debut, Conversations with Friends, was published when she was 26, but it was the phenomenally successful Normal People in 2018, following the intense, shifting relationship of students Connell and Marianne, that confirmed her brilliance at capturing the experience of being young in the 2010s. Holly WilliamsSadly, it has to be the Amazon Echo ‘smart’ speaker. Sadly because it represented the moment when a tech giant finally broke through the last barrier protecting our privacy – our homes. Alexa exploited our fatal addiction to convenience. And the sales it produces for Amazon far outweigh its loss-making initial cost. John NaughtonTen years ago, coffee shop chains were springing up on high streets across the UK, but with the ‘grab it and go’ revolution came an explosion in the number of disposable coffee cups used – and just as quickly thrown away. It took campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to reveal in his War on Waste programme that some 2.5bn of them end up in landfill in the UK every year. Enter the refillable, reusable portable coffee cup which all retailers now sell and which every smart, eco-conscious consumer should carry in their bag. Designs are improving, and often get you a discount to boot. Rebecca SmithersRagnar Kjartansson’s legendary nine-screen installation of 2012 toured the world to universal acclaim, raising the entire level of film art. Shot in one take, in a crumbling US mansion, each screen shows a lone musician in a separate room – drummer in the kitchen, pianist in the salon, Kjartansson on guitar in the bath. Although they cannot see each other, all unwittingly contribute to an astonishingly beautiful lament for the Icelandic artist’s failed marriage. A visual and harmonic feat that mesmerised audiences with its Shakespearian beauty. Laura CummingLet’s look on the bright side: not on the investment of surplus value in hermetically sealed towers and iconic gee-gaws but in the rise of a technology that might just reduce the impact of construction on the atmosphere. This is cross-laminated timber, in essence a sort of super-plywood, which makes buildings out of the renewable resources that are trees. It wasn’t invented in the last decade, but the 2010s saw its application for the first time to buildings both large and high.

It is the murmurings of hundreds of young men as they read aloud from the Torah or explore the meaning of the religious texts.Not so long ago, the soundtrack of this city on the river Tyne was the noise of heavy industry: shipbuilding, engineering, coalmining. It was all gone by the 1980s and 90s and, like so many other places, Gateshead struggled with unemployment, deprivation and loss of identity. Now it is home to the fastest-growing strictly Orthodox Jewish community in the UK, fuelled by the reputation of its educational establishments and cheap housing.“Gateshead is the Oxbridge of the UK Jewish community,” said Rabbi Shraga Feivel Zimmerman, a New Yorker known to his congregants simply as “the rov”, meaning notable rabbi. Since he arrived from Brooklyn in 2008, the community has doubled in size. “I hope I’ve helped the community to adapt to make it fertile ground for growth.”Gateshead was “quite a distance in miles, culture and mentality” from Brooklyn, said Zimmerman, but he came for the “unique opportunity to lead a community”. “England is a very conservative place and resistant to change in many ways. If you come from the outside, you have a fresh perspective.”The rabbi is credited with turning the community to engage with wider society. Links between the community and Gateshead council, the local further education college and other mainstream institutions have been nurtured. But Zimmerman is conscious of the potential downside of rapid growth. “One seeks a positive dynamic while still retaining a sense of community. Everyone here still knows each other, shares in each other’s celebrations, grieves together. We don’t want to keep doubling every 10 years,” he said.At the yeshiva, as everyone calls the Talmudical College, young men between the ages of 16 and early 20s study and debate religious texts in pairs for about 12 hours a day. They live in dormitories, have no access to smartphones, television or mainstream newspapers, and limited internet access.Nineteen-year-old Dovid Belovski, a Londoner in his second year at the yeshiva, said: “It’s intense, I can’t deny that. But I came here to be challenged, I never expected it to be easy. It’s the foundation for my life.”Studying at the Gateshead yeshiva may also improve a young man’s marriage prospects. The college’s graduates are considered a high-status catch by ultra-Orthodox parents seeking a match for their daughters.But, said David Schleider, who runs a youth club for boys in the community, “not everyone is cut out to be a rabbi or a teacher. We want to encourage those who aren’t to be skilled up while maintaining a full religious lifestyle. We have a very good relationship with Gateshead College, which provides culturally sensitive and accessible training.”In Orthodox Judaism, women cannot become rabbis, but bright girls are encouraged to teach. About 450 girls aged 16-plus – more than a quarter from abroad – are enrolled at the Jewish Teachers’ Training College in Gateshead, which offers A-levels in maths, biology, biblical Hebrew, computer science and art, as well as teacher training. Another girls’ seminary in the community has a more vocational focus, offering courses in information technology, health and childcare.A 2015 study by the Institute for Jewish Policy Research said the average birth rate among ultra-Orthodox women was seven, compared to 1.98 for mainstream Jewish women. A group of women community leaders in Gateshead, who all work outside the home, acknowledged the challenges of large families but spoke assertively about being fulfilled professionally, religiously, and as mothers and home-makers.One consequence of the expanding community is the growing number of businesses owned and run by strictly Orthodox Jews. Kosher bakery goods, milk and meat are produced locally. Blooms, a food takeaway that opened a few years ago with the blessing of Rabbi Zimmerman, is Jewish-owned but is partly staffed by young Geordie women who blithely talk through the requirements of kosher food preparation in between gentle banter with their ultra-Orthodox customers.Low house prices have helped the community to grow. One man who moved to Gateshead from north London a few years ago bought a six-bedroom house for £150,000. “It needed a lot of work but in London it would have cost at least £1m,” he said. Four years ago, the community completed its first social housing project, consisting of 12 four- or five-bedroom houses for rent.“Housing here is significantly cheaper than in London or even Manchester. But lots of families are low-income households, in receipt of benefits, and we tend to have bigger than average families. So there is a big demand for large affordable homes,” said Shlomi Isaacson of the Jewish Community Council of Gateshead (JCCG).Antisemitism appears to be less prevalent than in other places with high ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations. Nevertheless, the yeshiva has 80 CCTV cameras plus security guards. Most incidents fall into the “low-level antisocial antisemitism” category, said Jonathan Klajn, also of the JCCG. “It’s par for the course for someone to drive down the road, roll down their window and shout expletives at us. We’re uncomfortable with the security presence, but it’s a deterrent.” He added: “We rub along fine with the local Muslims.”The JCCG and representatives of Gateshead council meet regularly to discuss the needs of the community. “We recognised the culture and lifestyle of our Orthodox community is quite different to other communities,” said Dave Andrew, who has liaised on behalf of the council for the past 10 years.“Communication is the key, given that many households don’t engage with mainstream or social media so we need to ensure they get to hear what’s happening. This is not an insular community, but the reason for that perception is that it’s a community that helps itself at every life stage from the cradle to the grave.”Rabbi Zimmerman – who answers about 500 emails a week seeking guidance on Jewish law and practice – also rejected the suggestion of insularity, saying the community was independent and self-sustaining. “In former times, children grew up and left, they moved on to a larger world,” he said. “Now it’s a realistic option to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aa27a2a6980706253837154bb186c66724e72cb/0_38_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f1b2219d0054456ef089ee89b81818a","title":"narendra modi defends contentious citizenship law as clashes continue india","story":"PM denies law is anti-Muslim as police clash with demonstrators across IndiaClashes have continued between Indian police and protesters angered by a new citizenship law that excludes Muslims, as the prime minister, Narendra Modi, used a rally for his Hindu nationalist party to defend the legislation, accusing the opposition of pushing the country into a “fear psychosis”.Twenty-three people have been killed nationwide since the law was passed in parliament earlier this month in protests that represent the first major roadblock for Modi’s Hindu nationalist agenda since his party’s landslide re-election last spring.Authorities across the country have scrambled to contain the situation, banning public gatherings and blocking internet access. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued an advisory on Friday night asking broadcasters across the country to refrain from using content that could inflame further violence.Modi took the stage at a rally in the capital, launching his Bharatiya Janata party’s campaign for New Delhi legislative assembly elections in February, and quickly turned to the contentious new law.“People who are trying to spread lies and fear, look at my work. If you see any trace of isiveness in my work, show it to the world,” he said.Modi accused the main opposition Congress party of conspiring “to push not only New Delhi but other parts of the country into a fear psychosis”.“They are trying every tactic to push me out of power,” he said, urging protesters to desist from attacks on police and other violence.The law allows Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally to become citizens if they can show they were persecuted because of their religion in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.Critics have slammed the legislation as a violation of India’s secular constitution and have called it the latest effort by Modi’s government to marginalise the country’s 200 million Muslims.Protests against the law come amid an ongoing crackdown in Muslim-majority Kashmir, the restive Himalayan region stripped of its semi-autonomous status and demoted from a state into a federal territory in August.The demonstrations also follow a contentious process in the north-eastern state of Assam designed to weed out foreigners living in the country illegally. Nearly 2 million people, about half-Hindu and half-Muslim, were excluded from an official list of citizens – called the National Register of Citizens, or NRC – and have been asked to prove their citizenship or else be considered foreign.India is building a detention centre for some of the tens of thousands of people who the courts are expected to ultimately determine have entered illegally. Modi’s home affairs minister, Amit Shah, has pledged to roll out the process nationwide.“First, we will bring the citizenship amendment bill and will give citizenship to the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain and Christian refugees, the religious minorities from the neighbouring nations. Then, we will implement NRC to flush out the infiltrators from our country,” Shah said in an election speech last April.On Sunday, Modi denied the existence of a detention centre, accusing the Congress party of spreading fear that Indian Muslims would be jailed there. He also said that his opponents resented him for his work strengthening India’s ties to Iran, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries.A small band of supporters of Modi’s party marched in New Delhi on Sunday. Activists from India’s north-east, a mainly tribal area where people fear an influx of migrants will dilute their culture and political sway, also held a rally in the capital.The protests against the law began in Assam, the centre of a decades-old movement against migrants, before spreading to predominantly Muslim universities and then nationwide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3966646ad25043e01e85c945d9e6e95baa487db9/0_96_4552_2732/master/4552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5ad8f437d2995f5a20fcc3ef5a7a7d0","title":"spanish lottery winners strike it lucky in worlds richest draw el gordo","story":" Holders of ticket number 26590 win top prize in country’s bumper Christmas lotteryThe holders of ticket number 26590 struck it lucky in Spain when they won the top prize in the country’s bumper Christmas lottery.The top-prize-winning number, worth €400,000 (£341,000) fell out of the enormous metallic shuffling bins in a live televised event on Sunday morning. The winners won €20,000 for each euro spent on a €20 ticket.The incredibly popular lottery, known as El Gordo (“the fat one”), handed out a total of €2.24bn in prizes this year. There are lots of smaller prizes in addition to the top prize.Other lotteries have bigger inidual top prizes but El Gordo, held each year on 22 December, is ranked as the world’s richest for the total prize money involved.Children from Madrid’s San Ildefonso school called out the prizes on a nationally televised draw at Madrid’s Teatro Real opera house.Families, friends and co-workers buy tickets together as part of a winter holiday tradition.

Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Tim Burton-directed superhero film has multiple mistakes, but a major one happens in the scene when Joker and his crew deface paintings at a museum. One of his gang members slaps a painting with his hands that are covered in red paint, but in the next shot, the handprints have disappeared from the artwork.Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, flies back to Hollywood on a Boeing 747. But it would have been a 707. The film was set in 1969 and the 747 went into service in January 1970.Dustin Hoffman’s character drives in the wrong direction across the Bay Bridge in San Francisco on his way to Berkeley, California. He is travelling on the top deck of the bridge for traffic going from  California to San Francisco.There is a continuity issue at breakfast when Julia Roberts’s character takes a bite out of a croissant. She’s in the hotel room with her co-star Richard Gere, but when the camera pans back to her, it transforms into a pancake. Then when she takes a second bite out of the pancake, there is only one bite mark in it.529 North by Northwest (1959)One of the children playing an extra in Alfred Hitchcock’s film covers his ears a few seconds before Eva Marie Saint’s character unexpectedly fires a gun at Cary Grant’s character in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria.Bullet holes can be seen in the walls of the apartment where John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson’s characters go to get a briefcase, but it’s before the shoot-out has happened.729 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)John Connors Cessna’s plane numbers keep changing in the film. When he is in the hanger on the runway it is N3035C, but once it’s flying, the numbers change to N3413F.829 The Wizard of Oz (1939)Judy Garland isn’t wearing her iconic ruby red slippers in the scene where the trees pelt Dorothy and the Scarecrow with apples. Instead, she can be seen wearing plain black shoes.The baby that Bradley Cooper holds while adapting to civilian life after the Iraqi War is plastic. In fact, it looked so fake, even he admitted it was “nuts”.When computer expert David Levinson, played by Jeff Goldblum, is throwing a tantrum in the hanger housing the captured alien craft, he knocks over a bin that is labelled “Art Dept”. Clearly, a set designer left it there by mistake.1129 The Fast and the Furious (2001)In a scene when Jesse and Tran race, Tran is wearing a shirt with sleeves, but in the next shot he’s in a tank top. Didn’t anybody notice when they edited it?1229  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)We were always told that Harry Potter had his mother’s blue eyes. But when we see Lily Potter as a child, she has brown eyes. As a group of stormtroopers enter a control room, one of them accidentally bangs his head on a door. The actor responsible, Laurie Good, couldn’t believe it made it into the final film.  1429 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)There is a crew member wearing a cowboy hat and looking out to sea behind Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow on the pirate ship. 1529 Quantum of Solace (2008)A street cleaner behind Daniel Craig’s James Bond is pretending to sweep the road but is holding his broom several inches off the ground.1629 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)When Bianca accidentally shoots a gym teacher with an arrow, an extra, who is playing a student, runs off to get urgent help – but once she thinks she is out of shot, she stops and looks back at the camera.There is a modern car in the background of a big battle scene. Considering the film is set in the 13th century, it’s hard to imagine how it stayed in the final cut. Leonardo DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand while filming a scene in which he slams his hand on the table and breaks a glass. But rather than shout “cut”, he carried on in character. Tarantino liked it so much that he kept it in the film.Many of the mistakes are related to the film’s 1990s time period. These include computers using a wrongly dated version of Windows and Carol Danvers’s memories being jogged by a Nirvana song that wasn’t out until after she left Earth. Toby McGuire’s Spider-Man saves Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane from a group of attackers. He throws them through a set of windows before he kisses her upside down in the rain. But during their romantic embrace, the windows behind her are perfectly intact. As Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) dies one rainy evening, he releases a dove into a clear, blue sky. It is a lovely symbolic act but slightly dampened by this continuity error. Ridley Scott finally fixed this and other mistakes with his 2007 Final Cut.John Carpenter’s slasher film starring Jamie Lee Curtis was set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois, but all the cars have Californian number plates and there are shots of palm trees, as the film was shot in Southern California.At the end of the cult film, Data tells news reporters that the octopus was really scary, but this actually refers to a deleted scene. It was only added back in for the Disney Channel version.Eagle-eyed fans have noted that Ant-Man can be seen in two places at once during the final battle scene – in the van, and in his giant form, fighting alongside the other Avengers. 2529 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)Merry and Pippin are captured by the Orcs at the start of the film, and Pippin is seen in handcuffs. But he doesn’t have them anymore in the fight scene. And then they reappear on his wrists a few moments later.Ridley Scott’s epic film took place many centuries before fuel-powered vehicles. But during the Battle of Carthage, a gas canister can be seen on the back of a chariot when it flips over.There is a mix up over whether it is day or night at the beginning of the stock market heist scene in Christopher Nolan’s film. It is clearly daylight, but suddenly, after the police chase, it’s pitch black.When Jack (Leonardi DiCaprio) is painting a naked Rose (Kate Winslet) and tells her to go over by the bed, and then says he means the couch, it was DiCaprio flubbing his lines. But James Cameron kept it in the film because it was funny. The blockbuster featured about 33 mistakes, including a scene in which lead actor Chris Pratt talks to co-star Bryce Dallas Howard without his mouth moving. In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.The Tim Burton-directed superhero film has multiple mistakes, but a major one happens in the scene when Joker and his crew deface paintings at a museum.

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner.

He was violently sick and brought up some of the ribbon.”During the operations which lasted three hours, the vets managed to remove 34 decorative ribbons which had been attached to the tree decorations and which were causing a potentially fatal blockage.They also found that Marley had swallowed a number of bones which had also become lodged in its stomach.PDSA senior vet Aoife Clancy said: “It was a lengthy, high-risk surgery. Marley\u0027s chances of surviving the night were looking poor, so he was transferred to the out-of-hours provider, Vets Now, so he could be cared for overnight.“Thankfully he pulled through but needed critical round-the-clock care for four days before he could go home.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He\u0027s getting better and that\u0027s the best Christmas present I could ever want.”The treatment has cost PDSA more than £2,000, paid for by public donations.Ms Clancy said: “It\u0027s important that owners make sure decorations and toxic Christmas foods are safe from curious paws, as they can be incredibly harmful to our pets.“Foods including mince pies, chocolate, onions, raisins, grapes, macadamia nuts, sage-and-onion stuffing and Christmas cake can all be fatal.“Keep an eye out for signs including vomiting, diarrhoea, drinking excessively, shaking and restlessness.

Safe Northumberland council seat lost 2017.

Despite his party losing 59 seats, he insisted that Labour had “won the argument”.However, the BMG poll suggests that his economic agenda and his stance on national security issues were both particularly unpopular.It found that 46 per cent of voters think Labour should ditch its current agenda on tax and change course, while just 27 per cent are in favour of\u0026nbsppolicy similar to Mr Corbyn’s.\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell vows to stay out of Labour leadership contestForty-five per cent of voters also want Labour’s current positions on public spending and nationalisation to be dumped, while in both cases 28 per cent do not.The gap is even wider on security issues, with 48 per cent saying that the new leader should break with Mr Corbyn’s approach to defence. Just 21 per cent support the current policy.Even among Labour voters, only around half say the next leader should definitely continue Mr Corbyn’s approach to tax and nationalisation.By contrast, Labour’s current health policies are much more popular, with a majority (42 per cent versus 33 per cent) wanting them to be maintained.

Corbyn’s constituency neighbour and friend, Emily Thornberry, has been critical of the party’s Brexit stance, but has remained loyal to the leadership and has represented the Labour Party on various overseas visits. Robert Struthers, research manager at BMG, said: “As the Labour Party enters a period of soul searching, this polling suggests that there is much that the public would like the next Labour leader to change with respect to the party’s\u0026nbsppolicy platform.“From the areas listed, the NHS and climate change are areas where more voters feel Jeremy Corbyn’s positions are in the right place. For instance, in the case of the NHS, close to half of the public think the next Labour leader should pursue a similar agenda, including three-quarters of those who backed Labour at the ballot box earlier this month.“More concerning are areas such as defence, taxation\u0026nbspand nationalisation, where many more think the next Labour leader should change direction. Indeed, in terms of defence and security – an area where Mr Corbyn often clashed with his critics on the right of the Labour party – it is particularly telling that more of even those who still backed Labour just two weeks ago think the next Labour leader should change course than believe they should stick with Corbyn’s platform.”The BMG poll revealed that voters are not yet impressed by any of the potential candidates.When the\u0026nbsppublic\u0026nbspis asked who should succeed Mr Corbyn, Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspis the most popular option, but he is backed by just 9 per cent of voters – narrowly ahead of Ms Phillips (8 per cent) and Ms Cooper (6\u0026nbspper cent).\u0026nbspIn a blow to Ms Long Bailey, who is seen as Sir\u0026nbspKeir’s main rival as frontrunner, only 2\u0026nbspper cent of people polled said they wanted her to replace Mr Corbyn, while 61 per cent said they had never heard of her. The Corbyn ally comes behind Mr\u0026nbspLammy, the Tottenham MP, and Ms\u0026nbspNandy, the Wigan MP, when voters are asked who should be the next Labour leader.Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspis also the most popular choice among Labour voters, with 16 per cent preferring. He is ahead of\u0026nbspMs Phillips (11 per cent) and Ms Cooper (7 per cent).Among Tory voters, many of whom Labour will need to win over if is to win the next election, Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspis marginally less popular than Ms Cooper.The poll found that many members of Labour’s top team have barely registered with voters. Ms Cooper was the best known, with 60 per cent of people saying they had heard of her, followed by 55 for Ms\u0026nbspThornberry, 50 per cent for Sir\u0026nbspKeir\u0026nbspand 48 per cent for Mr\u0026nbspLammy.The figure drops to 28 per cent for Ms\u0026nbspNandy\u0026nbspand 23 per cent for Mr Lewis.BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,506 GB adults online between 17 and 20 December.

By the same measure, negative coverage of the Conservatives halved.”The research also reveals a high presidentialised campaign, with Mr\u0026nbspJohnson and Jeremy Corbyn by far the most prominent figures in the media coverage. The researchers found that most contenders for the next Labour leadership contest featured little in coverage.\u0026nbspThe study found that Brexit was “by far the most dominant issue” at critical points in the campaign – its start and end – but in intervening periods its prominence was lower.“Research has shown that many voters only start paying attention in the last days of an election, so the final rush of Brexit coverage could have been consequential,” the researchers said.\u0026nbspWhile the Conservatives had the edge in press coverage in 2017, the researchers found that the media landscape was much closer at the previous election: the Conservatives had a balance of minus 0.09 to Labour’s minus 0.13 in the balance of positive and negative stories – meaning Labour was only somewhat more negatively portrayed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Because of accusations of widespread fraud, no results were announced, and the two leading contenders, Mr Ghani and Mr Abdullah, agreed to share power.Afghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruptionThe partnership has been fraught with bickering and rifts.If the preliminary results hold and Mr Ghani remains president it will give him the authority he has been seeking to demand a leading role in peace talks with the Taliban.Until now he and his government have been sidelined over the last year of direct talks between the US and the Taliban. Washington seeks to withdraw its troops and bring to an end its longest war, ending 18 years of fighting in Afghanistan.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The most recent poll showed 62 per cent of people support the strikes – up three points from a similar poll last week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The majority of French people support the action because they are not fooled,” Danielle Simonnet, an elected member of the Paris city council, told The Independent. “They know that with these reforms we will all lose.”Simonnet joined mass protests this week, which saw more than half a million people join street demonstrations throughout France calling on President Emmanuel Macron to drop plans to introduce a universal pension scheme. The reforms were one of Macron’s flagship election promises, which he claims are necessary to revitalise France’s economy.Protestors say the reforms are a betrayal of workers’ rights within one of the world’s most socially progressive systems. For most, they will mean working longer for less money, with a new “pivot age” of 64 forcing people to work an extra two years to receive a full pension.Attempts to frame the narrative against the industrial action backfired over the weekend, after one reporter’s attempts to sow discontent among commuters caused\u0026nbspthe hashtag “Proud of the strike” to trend across social media.\u0026nbspOne thousand tractors roll into Paris for farmer protestIt happened after a TV journalist from\u0026nbspBFM TV suggested that travellers were fed up with the strikes after national rail firm\u0026nbspSNCF\u0026nbspannounced train cancellations for 23 and 24 December. A passerby at the Gare de Lyon station in Paris interrupted the report to say they were “embarrassed by the tone”.The commuter continued: “This is a very difficult period… but the real problem is not the people on strike. We have to look elsewhere.”It is a sentiment shared by critics of Macron, who say his neoliberal agenda favours businesses, and those already well-off, over ordinary workers. Macron, a former investment banker, has faced similar accusations since long before these strikes began through the Yellow Vest protests, which have now entered their 58th consecutive weekend of unrest.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Protestors clashed with police on Tuesday,\u0026nbsptrading tear\u0026nbspgas for petrol bombs. Half of the 16 metro lines in the capital were not running at all for most of the week, with a further six experiencing severe disruption. The only two lines running normally were the line 1 and line 14 – both of which operate without human drivers.\u0026nbspAt over-crowded bus stops this weekend, people spilled off pavements and onto the street, with any buses that were running often too full to pick up more passengers.One way to get across the city was on the free-floating bicycles and e-scooters, but even these have proved problematic. Unions were angered by public transport operator RATP’s decision ahead of the strikes to team up with the e-scooter companies to offer discounts for commuters.\u0026nbspUnion leaders described the move as a “provocation” designed to undermine the action. Since the strikes began, thousands of electric scooters in Paris, Lyon and Bordeaux have been vandalised by protestors.Lime, the largest e-scooter operator in Paris, did not give exact figures for how many of its machines have been damaged in recent weeks. A spokesperson for the firm also did not comment on the strikes, simply telling The Independent: “Vandalising our electric scooters disrupts the thousands of Parisians who use them to travel around the city at this busy time of year.”Another day of mass protests are planned for 9 January – more than a month after the strikes began. Negotiations between the government and unions will also resume in January, with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe hoping to pass legislation by the summer.But his most recent plea for public transport companies to resume services over the holidays was ignored. Unions said there would be no “Christmas truce”, with CFDT union leader Laurent Berger responding: “The prime minister hasn’t heard what the street is saying.”The last time such drastic public sector reforms were proposed was in 1995, when three weeks of nationwide strikes resulted in the government eventually capitulating.\u0026nbspWhile they continue to have the public’s backing, it seems unlikely the latest strikes will end until workers’ demands are met.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care? Forced into a life of domestic servitude, Haiti’s child slavesThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolThe importance of a solid work ethic was engrained into me at a young age. However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Excellent.It’s asBritain has been engulfed by a sudden outbreak of common sense.EVEN in a crowded field of terrible options for new Labour leader, Keir Starmer stands out as a stone-cold loser.The man best known for his dismal failures as Director of Public Prosecutions and for talking Labour into its suicidal “people’s vote” strategy.Sir Keir, the multi-millionaire human rights QC now posing as a working-class boy.Only one alternative is LESS likely to win back working-class voters in the North: Emily Thornberry — Lady Nugee, to be formal — another sanctimonious Islington barrister who sneers at working people and marched to reverse their Brexit vote dressed as an EU flag.Labour would be insane to pick either. Especially now we know the election result flattered Corbyn.The boundaries are still skewed in Labour’s favour — and the Brexit Party seems to have gted Corbyn  northern seats by ­preventing certain Tory victories.Labour’s problems run far deeper than they have realised. That’s without picking smug, rich London Remainers as leader.A PLEA to our new Government: go with the evidence. There is no proof sugar taxes work. Don’t even think about more of them.Boris Johnson is clearly no fan of the fizzy drinks levy his predecessors were persuaded to impose. Health Secretary Matt Hancock must not buckle to the same nanny state health lobbyists.Such taxes can only be justiedthey cut obesity. There’s no evidence of that anywhere. Nor will there be, no matter how many milkshakes you add them to. They just make shopping pricier for all.The Tories should use their powerful new mandate to build more sports facilities or boost children’s education about the value of healthy eating and exercise.Not to ramp up taxes with no provable benefit to public health. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And then he also didn’t notice when the car span round and hit the front of his lorry again.And finally he didn’t notice when he was ­actually pushing the car SIDEWAYS along the busy dual carriageway.The man in the Golf was presumably leaning on his horn as hard as he was leaning on his brakes. Everyone in every other car on the road was also leaning on their horn and gesticulating.But still, chummy in the cab kept rolling along. I have spoken to lorry drivers about how this could be possible and they say that in the Daf truck that our friend was driving, it isn’t.They say that in a Volvo you sit so high up, your view of the road ahead is obscured by clouds and solar flares. But the seating ­position in a Daf is ­famously low down.So he MUST have noticed that instead of a teddy tied to his radiator grille, he had a full-sized Golf. Me though  I have another suggestion.Yes, the Golf’s tyres would have been making a right old din buthe’d had the radio on, maybe he didn’t hear them.And sure, it takes quite of lot of effort to push a Golf sideways along the road. But the engine in that Daf is designed to haul tonnes, and at the time of the incident no trailer was attached.Now that I’m a farmer, I understand the problem here. All my neighbouring farmers say that my new tractor is far too large.To which I say that tractors are like penises. And therefore cannot be too large. They also say the  horsepower it develops is too much.And on that, I sort of know what they mean. In a less powerful tractor you can sense when the ground is soft or the load is too heavy.But in mine, I just sit there listening to the radio, not noticing that my cultivator on the back has become entangled in a hedge and is ripping the whole thing out of the ground.Once, I turned round after I’d done a nice straight line across a field, to find I’d been pulling a whole postcode behind me.There were houses, schools and even a ­couple of churches in the mountain of mud I’d been dragging along.If I somehow hit a Volkswagen in my tractor, and I couldn’t see it out of the window, I definitely wouldn’t notice.Any more than I’d noticea baby wren landed on the roof. I’m sure that for the Golf driver on the A, it must have been a pretty scary moment. I sympathise with him.But I also sympathise with the lorry driver who set off to work as a man and arrived as an internet sensation with no one to sympathise with him except me and an eye-witness called Ellie Goulding.WE were told on Wednesday that Australia had endured its hottest day EVER.But that’s not strictly accurate. Yes, the average temperature across the whole of the country was .Cand that’s pretty toasty.But several million years ago, the world was around ten times hotter than that.And back in the days when rock was still liquid and the continents were sorting themselves out, temperatures hovered round the clock at around ,C.So when scientists say Australia has had its hottest day ever, what they mean is: “Australia has had its ­hottest day since records began.”Which in geological time is about . of a second.Big headlines in Buenos Aires, for sure. And maybe a fleet heading off to the Falklands again.WHEREVER my late mother is right now, she’ll be very happy, because Nicky Henson has died. She adored him.He was best known as the lothario from Fawlty Towers, but she loved him best for his stage performance in Noises Off.She loved him so much, in fact, thatmemory serves, she went to see him every night for about a year.Because it was so sweaty and horrid in there, I walked through the door, turned round and walked straight out again.IF you are wondering what to watch on TV over Christmas, may I suggest The Last Ship, on Amazon Prime.The executive producer is Michael Bay, which means everything blows up all the time.It features a really cool destroyer, some really bad baddies and some really cool goodies who say: “Secure the perimeter” every five minutes.Best of all, though, it stars the incomparable Rhona Mitra, whose work, and face, I’ve admired for years.THE Labourites squabbling over who will be their next party leader are all saying they’ll keep Jeremy Corbyn’s policies alive.This is excellent news because, in five years, we will get yet another chance to keep them out of Downing Street.SO, there’s a -year-old man in Norway who’s won  elite games of chess on the trot and is now the World Champion.That’s pretty impressive, but for Magnus Carlsen it’s just an aside, because in his local football league he’s a bit of a star as well.In fact, last time out, he scored  goals. At two, he could solve -piece jigsaw puzzles. By five he could recall the size, population and flag of every country on Earth.And by  he’d become a chess grandmaster. You’d imagine, then, that with such a mind he could do anything with his le. Unwrap the secrets of cold fusion.Conquer the problems of faster-than-light travel. Work out how you can open the wrapping of a Gillette razor using only your hands. But no.Instead, Magnus turned his attention to fantasy football, where, inevitably, he’s thrashed seven million other players to become the best in the world.As I write, he’s about to beat the all-time record of  undefeated games. And why did he do this, when he could have achieved so much more Well, it might have something to do with the fact he’s Norwegian. The Norse don’t like to make a fuss.They don’t like to stand out. Which is why, in the country’s entire history, all they’ve ever invented is the cheese kne.FINALLY, may I just take a moment to wish everyone in the whole world a very happy Christmas.Except Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn.

But not quite.Even we, though, didn’t dare to dream that a proper Brexit — no customs union, no single market, fully taking back control — would pass by a thumping margin under a Boris Johnson Government beginning five years in power.The Remainer wreckers are gone. Yet, incredibly, Brexit was STILL opposed by the twitching corpse of the Labour Party in a last, spiteful two-fingered gesture to its former voters.What don’t these MPs get  They bet the house on a “people’s vote” and lost. And yet they still witter on about second referendums, customs unions or otherwise tying ourselves to the EU.One voice seemed to speak sense. “We recognise the clear message from the public,” said Jeremy Corbyn. “We have to respect that and move on.”Then, ridiculously, he led his rabble through the lobby to vote against Brexit one last time.A historic day, with Labour yet again on the wrong side of it. And for Corbyn, a dismal end to his inglorious week of sullen silence and door-slamming petulance.WE’RE confused.One minute Corbyn takes responsibility for his defeat. The next he blames hostility from “billionaire Press barons”.He cannot grasp a simple reality about The Sun. If we fear a wannabe Government will wreck the economy and destroy our readers’ jobs, we oppose it.But the Left think anyone not devoted to socialist purity must have corrupt motives. And for these zealots the answer is an even more left-wing leader. Maybe contender Clive Lewis, who makes Corbyn look like Norman Tebbit.Unless they grow out of this, they will spend their lives in impotent opposition.IT is high time to end voter fraud, using compulsory photo ID. We are delighted the Tories aim to do it.The Left always protests it is so rare it is not worth the fuss. Whatever could they be worried about  Surely not that the poorest will be deprived of their vote, since photo IDs will be free. What other motive could they have There is a wealth of first-hand or anecdotal evidence of people voting multiple times in dferent constituencies, stealing someone ’s vote, voting by post AND in person and so on.Conviction rates are low only because the system is so wide open it is hard to spot and catch offenders. But this is a serious crime meriting jail every time.And when so many routine tasks now require ID, one as vital to our democracy as casting your ballot certainly should.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because who wants to sit there being sold to Those were simpler days.So much has changed, including a new profession coming into existence: The influencer.The problem with influencers is that it’s impossible to tell whether they are enthusiastically mentioning products because they love them or because they are being paid to.Eventhey really love a certain cream or tea, when money changes hands, the water is muddied.We like to believe people would only promote products that make their lives better.But the clue is in the name. Anyone whose job title is “influencer” is being paid to sway their followers into buying things they otherwise would not.As a result, we don’t know who to trust.This was illustrated this week by Lauren Goodger being caught on camera for a BBC show agreeing to promote a drink containing hydrogen cyanide.The reality TV star was secretly filmed during a meeting where she was asked to promote a fake diet drink named Cyanora — said to contain the deadly chemical hydrogen cyanide — on Instagram.It was part of an investigation by the documentary into whether celebrities consume the products which they are paid to promote.The alacrity with which Goodger agreed to promote this fake product was alarming.Similarly worrying, to demonstrate her willingness to promote a product she had never tried, she talked about how she promoted another product, Skinny Coffee, which in January she claimed helped her lose lb in three weeks.“I never tried Skinny Coffee,” she admitted.To drive the point home, she added: “I’ve even had my own friends message me, ‘Laur, can you get me some of that Skinny Coffee, does it work ’ . . . I’m like, ‘Do you not know this by now ’ And they’re actually going and buying it and I’m like, ‘You know how this works’.”At least she is honest. When she doesn’t realise she is being recorded.By way of explanation, a representative for Goodger said: “Lauren was asked to . . . appear in an advert for a new water.“There was no mention of what the water contained before the meeting. The money on the table was quite a large sum.”Goodger herself said: “As with any audition, you people-please and say what they want to hear.“They asked me, ‘Would I promote the drink without using it ’ In the heat of the moment, I said yes and also said I hadn’t tried Skinny Coffee — in the hope of getting the job.“I would never promote anything on my Instagram that I don’t feel is right for my followers and that I haven’t used. The sit-down meeting after the audition was filmed undercover without my knowledge.”So I guess we take this to mean that had she known she was being filmed, she wouldn’t have been so up-front about the real role of an influencer.It is easy to forget that influencers are paid to promote products.Even those who start off promising to recommend only things they like are probably susceptible,the price is right. Andthat is the case, how can we believe anything is a genuine endorsement So, who can we trust  Let’s start with ourselves. Instead of handing our likes and values over to be decided by so-called influencers, we should remember our own sense of self and what we like and dislike.And let’s go back to another thing from the good old days: Trusting real friends instead of Instagram ones.FALLON SHERROCK made history this week as the first woman to beat a man at the PDC World Darts Championships.She was so surprised to beat Ted Evetts - at Alexandra Palace on Tuesday she wept tears of joy, saying: “I have proved we can play the men and we can beat them!”Fallon, , who until four years ago was a professional hairdresser, first picked up darts at the age of .She later added: “I can’t believe what I achieved. I’m so happy.I always had the game but us women have never had the opportunity to prove it.”Very true. But isn’t it mad  There is no reason why a woman can’t play darts as well as a man.But it also needs people to stop treating it like a service for plasters, reassurance and insignicant ailments.Take the man on C’s  Hours In AE who turned up at hospital with a stf neck.Issuing fines to time-wasters is the only way people will start to realise how valuable our NHS is – and how we need to treat it with the respect it deserves or risk losing it.I AM pleased the judge’s decision to impose two le sentences on “Black Cab Rapist” John Worboys could see him die behind bars.Mrs Justice Gowan handed Worboys, , a minimum term of six years for attacking four women and he will have no chance of parole before .Worboys, one of Britain’s worst sexual predators, now goes by the name John Derek Radford and has been in jail since  for abusing  other victims.It is believed he plied more than  women with drink laced with sedatives from a “rape kit” kept in his cab.The judge told him he may never be released, branding him “still dangerous”.For once, in this case le really does mean le. It is likely he will die in prison.And just think: Last year, the idiots on the Parole Board were actually going to let him out.PHOTOS of Beyonce at rapper Diddy’s th birthday party are jaw-dropping.She looked a million dollars in that dress .But also, who knew Alexis Carrington’s  Dynasty fashion was back  I guess we do now.JUSTIN Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, has been on the receiving end of some unfair bashing of late.Firstly he was accused by some of being a “leftie Remainer”. Then others called him a Tory. Obviously he can’t be both.To be called a racist by voices on the Left for defending the Chief Rabbi was outrageous.The Archbishop was criticised when he effectively backed the Chief Rabbi’s comments about the Labour leadership’s record on anti-Semitism with a tweet highlighting the “deep sense of insecurity and fear felt by many British Jews”.Welby has done some great stuff lately, including going to ebola zones against all advice.Not only that, his voice is vital at this time of year as the country needs to come together post-election and at the start of a new decade.He was right to defend the Chief Rabbi and we should come together to support him as the leader of the Church of England.It is a tad violent, but it is great.Ben Hardy plays a guy who is an expert in extreme sport parkour .I met Ben when I was on ITV’s Lorraine this week.He is a lovely man and a great actor.I ADMIRE Sharon Osborne’s honesty about what she has done to look the way she does.Namely, she has spent £, on a facelt, tummy tuck, eye lt, abdominoplasty, liposuction and Botox, breast surgery, vaginal cosmetic surgery, and lost more than lb after gastric surgery.In the past, she has said: “There’s not much I haven’t had tweaked, stretched, peeled, lasered, veneered, enhanced or removed altogether.”Live and let live, I always say. Clearly Sharon is happy with the work she has had done and she looks great.Some people, we would say, grow old gracefully.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER! ORDER!” seems as quaintly ancient as Larry Grayson’s “Oooh, shut that door!” or Dick Emery’s “Oooh, you are awful – but I like you!”Bercow is reduced to bellowing “ORDER! ORDER!” to the baffled viewers of Italian TV.He has even been spied shouting his hackneyed catchphrase at his fellow travellers on a south London bus.It seems like only last week that Bercow took enormous preening delight in bellowing, “ORDER! ORDER!” at the mother of all Parliaments.Now yesterday’s Speaker is shouting it on the number  to Catford.He should have borrowed one of Ken Livingstone’s newts.IT has been a bad year for boxing when your favourite fistic moment is Kate Beckinsale demonstrating her stf right cross for Women’s Health magazine.At the start of , it seemed inevitable that Anthony Joshua, Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder would have a series of fights to match the glory days of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman.They somehow all avoided each other.With the Fury-Wilder rematch allegedly about to be announced for February, perhaps  will be better for boxing.Andit’s not – well, fight fans have always got Kate Beckinsale’s right hander.AFTER Mathew Horne’s late-night trolling of the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, I am giving the Gavin  Stacey Christmas special a miss.You can watch performers you don’t care for.For example, I can’t stand Benedict Cumberbatch – the eco-activist who advertises cars in China – but I will watch Cumberbatch in Sam Mendes’ World War One film  next year because it sounds unmissable.But Gavin, Stacey and Mathew  I can live without it.Horne tweeted: “I really wish I loved myself as much as you, Laura . . . your ‘journalism’ knows no bounds . . . Resign, you disingenuous plopcarpet.”And plenty more of the same spiteful, semi-literate garbage.It is mind-blowing how totally lost these right-on Rada revolutionaries are when someone doesn’t write them a script.And voters really, REALLY don’t like it.EVERY one of the candidates who Hugh Grant campaigned for at the General Election lost.

It will have done the main thing that it was put in power to do within two months of taking office.The danger for the Tories is that their new electoral ­coalition was held together by a desire to Get Brexit Done and fear of Jeremy Corbyn, and both of those issues will soon be resolved.As the party’s campaign director, Isaac Levido, pointed out to Tory MPs on Wednesday afternoon, Brexit and Corbyn won this election for the Tories and both of them will be gone by the time of the next ­election, so the Tories have to deliver for their new voters or risk defeat.No  is acutely ­conscious of this risk. They know they need a new glue for their coalition — and fast.At Political Cabinet on Tuesday morning, this point was rammed home to ministers by both the PM and Levido.Levido, a clear-sighted Australian, warned the assembled secretaries of state that the Tories have “not won the domestic policy fight” yet.He stressed that this election had been about Getting Brexit Done more than any other issue.Tory support among Leave voters went from  per cent in  to  per cent, and that was key to the victory.Ministers were told that the party’s polling showed the positive things voters associated with the Tories were about sorting Brexit, while the negative things about Labour were to do with Corbyn or Brexit.Levido was clear that voters were backing the Tories to finish Brexit — not because they had suddenly become Conservatives. Another danger for the Tories is that Labour’s fundamental brand is nowhere near as damaged as many at Westminster think.With Corbyn gone and Brexit removed as an issue, the party may well be able to bounce back much faster than expected.Levido pointed out that the Tories’ own polling of  marginal seats had seen the gap between the two parties narrow to just four points in the aftermath of the manestos, as Labour briefly succeeded in turning the conversation away from Brexit.Boris Johnson and the Tory campaign pushed Brexit back to the top of the agenda.Levido was clear that for this reason the election could not be seen as a categorical rejection of Labour’s policies. The challenge for the Tories is to move fast to deliver change, so that people do not feel tempted to go back to Labour again.Do this right and, over the next decade, Darlington, West Bromwich and Wrexham will become Tory heartlands. Get it wrong and these places will turn red once again.Boris told cabinet ministers that voters needed to see and feel change in their local AE and on their roads and high streets.He said there needed to be a clear reduction in homelessness and voters must know that they and their family have a better chance of owning a home. This election made the Tories a national party again.Now they must show these new voters that their cares are Conservative concerns — and that the party knows how to fix the problems. They must deliver for the whole nation.WHERE is the geographical centre of the new Tory party  Well, before the election it was Buckinghamshire.Now it is South Yorkshire, where the Tories hold three seats – Rother Valley, Don Valley and Penistone And Stocksbridge.James Cleverly, the ebullient Tory chairman, has relished telling colleagues this fact. I understand that to reflect this new reality, the Tories are planning to move a large chunk of their party headquarters up north.The thinking is that by getting a chunk of the party operation out of London and into the North, it will make the party less London-centric and more attuned to the concerns of the rest of the country.BORIS JOHNSON is determined that next year must not be as dominated by Brexit as this year has been. He told Cabinet this week that once the UK leaves the EU on January , they should stop talking about Brexit.The PM argued that while the EU would try to create new clf edges and fresh moments of drama, the Government should resist being drawn into this dynamic.He argued that ministers should instead approach it as a normal trade negotiation rather than as some epoch-defining event.I am told that as part of the Government’s effort to de-dramatise things, they intend to resist going to Brussels for every negotiation – something which only adds to the tension and drama.I understand they want negotiations on both sides of the Channel rather than the UK always looking like a supplicant in heading to Europe to be told what it can and cannot have.As part of the effort to lower the profile of these trade talks, I am informed that David Frost – Boris’s understated but effective EU sherpa – will carry on conducting the negotiations.Frost, who is trusted totally by the PM and his inner circle, secured the changes to the withdrawal agreement that made it acceptable to Tory MPs. Having Frost conduct the negotiations rather than a cabinet minister will make them less likely to dominate the news.But there is no getting away from the importance of these talks to the UK. The deal will be the first trade deal the nation has done in -odd years and will be hugely important in determining the future economic direction of this country.The Tories calculate that, for his part, Sir Keir Starmer, the strongest Shadow Cabinet advocate of a second referendum, would deepen Labour’s problem in Leave-voting seats.The only candidate currently causing some concern is Jess Phillips – regarded as the high-risk, high-reward option for Labour.But given her low standing with the Corbyn-backing membership, she is not currently looking like a top- tier candidate.WHEN two or three ministers are gathered together, they start to nervously whisper about the February reshuffle.It is expected that this reshuffle will be big and coincide with the changes to Whitehall that Boris Johnson is keen to introduce. He wants to create some new departments, merge others and even shutter some.Boris’s old allies, though, are warning against a shake-up that sees too many of them replaced.One confidant of this group tells me Boris’s new support base in the party is “a mile wide and an inch deep” and that he needs to keep close those who have been loyal to him through thick and thin.One person who is certain to be rewarded in the reshuffle is Brandon Lewis, the Security Minister.Johnson’s team were impressed by his work during the campaign and want to use him more in the media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The little cutie is one today – a miracle in itself after she arrived in the world tipping the scales at just g – lb oz. Parents Leah and Siegfried were braced for the worst when Bonnie was born at  weeks. Leah , says: “I honestly didn’t knowwe’d see this day. When I went into labour the doctors talked to me about my next pregnancy. It was clear they had no hope. “But here she is now, sitting up, babbling and laughing, with no idea how close we came to losing her.” Former social media manager Leah was determined to keep her baby inside for as long as possible after feeling her membranes bulging at home. Admitted to hospital, she dropped the head of her hospital bed down the moment medics were out of the room to use gravity to keep Bonnie in. She lay reclined in what is known as the Trendelenburg position. Leah, from Portslade, Brighton, says: “I wasn’t having contractions or pain, but I could feel pressure down there and sensed whatever had gone wrong with my pregnancy, it was purely mechanical.” Against doctor’s advice, and at the risk of developing blood clots, Leah spent a week on bed rest to give her little girl a fighting chance of survival at birth. In the UK, the age of viability is  weeks – the same as the abortion limit. Before then, doctors are not legally obliged to help premature babies as the damage to their little bodies is said to be too great, with chances of survival slim. The chance of a -week-old baby surviving outside the womb without brain damage, physical or developmental problems is just  per cent. But Leah was determined to protect her baby, who had been perfectly healthy at a scan two weeks earlier. And at pm each day, she and Siegfried high-fived to celebrate another  hours that she had staved off labour. Leah was given steroids to help the baby’s lungs and magnesium sulphate to protect her brain. Bonnie was delivered a week after Leah was admitted to hospital – just two days before viability.  Her eyes were still fused shut and her delicate, paper-thin skin was translucent. Leah recalls: “She breathed on her own for two minutes before stopping, so the team took her across the room to resuscitate her. But first they had to wait to seeshe’d survive a further minute on her own. “It was the longest, most agonising  seconds of my le. We’d agreed with doctors we wanted them to help herthey could, but acceptedshe was suffering we’d give comfort care and simply hold her until nature took its course.” Swaddled in a plastic bag and bubble wrap to keep her warm, tiny Bonnie fought through the next few days.  On Christmas Day, the NICU staff made ink footprints of her feet and presented Leah and Siegfried, , with a Reindeer Christmas card. It struck a chord with Leah, who adds: “We’d seen how tiny Bonnie was, like a tiny little bird in her incubator, but seeing that card really drove home what a miracle it was that she was still alive.” The couple spent Christmas watching over Bonnie in the NICU at the Royal Sussex Hospital, Brighton, while relatives looked after their son Teddy, then  months old. Bonnie was too fragile to hold but Leah found joy in giving her drops of water on the end of a cotton bud and applying gentle pressure on her head and tummy to simulate the feeling of being in the womb. It is known as “containment holding.”  But there were still concerns. Bonnie developed retinopathy and had surgery at eight weeks to save her sight. She also had chronic lung disease due to prolonged oxygen support and needed blood transfusions after developing an infection. Her oxygen also dipped to just six percent at times, leaving her floppy, blue and moments from death. Leah and Siegfried were told several times to prepare for the worst. But Leah says: “Every time things got hairy, Bonnie pulled through. From the start, she fought the nurses whenever they adjusted her oxygen mask, batting them away with her little arms, and many of them remarked what a little fighter she was.” It was a month before mum and baby had their first cuddle. Bonnie was finally discharged a week before her original due date of April . Fast forward eight months and she is now a happy and entirely healthy lb.  Leah says: “Last Christmas we were scouring the news for articles about ‘preemies’ who had made it against the odds and hoping against hope that we would be one of the lucky ones. “I hope mums and dads will find Bonnie inspiring and keep faith in the medical staff and their preemies’ will to fight, even on the toughest days.” Siegfried echoes Leah’s sentiments – while recalling the nightmare first days of Bonnie’s le. He says: “It was a dark time. We could only sit, watch and hope she would pull through. “I felt powerless but, above all, I wanted to be there for her so she could feel her daddy’s presence and know she was loved. “The worst part was the unknown. Would she live or die, what kind of quality of le would she have  Trying to maintain a normal le for our son and work was close to impossible, but you can’t just crack when you’re a dad. “When I first saw Bonnie, I could barely comprehend how small she was and wanted to give her everything in le.

The couple have always been very tactile but their touch and eye contact rituals show no sign of diminishing, meaning their body language rituals seem to place them in an on-going ‘Honeymoon phase’ of their relationship. This means they appear to want to illustrate and act out their love in public. This is the kind of exclusivity and intimacy rituals that can make other people feel excluded around them. It’s hard to see how a couple so openly in love could cause any offence but presumably the dinner party set expect open and active sociability rather than a couple appearing to send affectionate tie-signs to one another that suggest they are carrying on some secret and often flirty silent conversations in public. aposFlirty and playful Meghan’s few appearances since Archie was born seem to register an increase of these intimacy ‘in love’ signals that involve even more mutual eye-gazing and celebratory smiles to suggest their relationship has intensied with their new role as parents. In this photothese very flirty and playful signals show a mutually tactile couple keen to share jokes and silent communication. Harry looks very protective here and Meghan flatters him by looking down and laughing as they wind their arms round one another’s waists and lean in together. aposBonding and touch are important, especially to Meghanapos  This pose suggests a more open sociability, with both smiling outward and looking relaxed. These smiles look prompted by the cameras and audience rather than just one another, which would normally be a stage a couple deeply in love would go through as they move out of the obsessional, passionate stage and into something more relaxed, happy and confident. The entwined hands show how important bonding and touch are to the couple, especially to Meghan, who placed her right hand onto their clasped hands to make the loving connection gesture even more emphatic. aposThey are lost to the worldapos  In this image Harry and Meghan turned this simple, congratulatory kiss at polo into a romantic and intimate moment. Meghan threw her head back, baring her neck and the couple used mutual eye gaze to suggest they were lost to the world at that moment. This could have just been a smiling kiss on the cheek but the couple appeared to want to use the moment to reinforce their love for one another. aposTheir bonds are stronger than everaposIn both these photos there’s no change in their tie-signs now Archie has been born, with the linked hands and the excited-looking smiles suggesting their bonds might be stronger than ever. The romance comes from the way Harry gazes adoringly at Meghan and their pinging smiles seem to bounce off one another. aposMeghan gazing up adoringly at Harryapos "},{"url":null,"title":"health games casino offer promotion","story":"Advertorial£ bonus offer from Health Games casino - with £million jackpots to be wonHave fun and give back to charities across the UK playing more than  exciting gamesShareByDave Masters:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Advertorial\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor all the excitement and fun it brings, Christmas can be a bit of a nightmare - especiallyyouaposre the one hosting.A panic to get the house ready for family and friends to visit over the holidays followed by a mass clean down as you find corners to your house you didnapost realise existed.Fortunately Lynsey Crombie, Queen of Clean, has some advice to get you through the seasonal celebrations. Prepare your entrance Place a doormat outside, and an extra bit of carpeting on the inside, for visitors to wipe their feet. Place an additional shoe rack or a large plastic tub laundry basket in the entrance of your home, so people get the hint to take off their shoes, which can then be left neat and tidy. There is nothing worse than having a heap of shoes lying in your hallway, and the risk of falling over them.  Create a slipper basket It’s a nice idea. When guests have removed their shoes, leave a basket of slippers at the door for them to slip into when they come in. This way, everyone will feel at home quickly and can enjoy having warm feet for the rest of the evening. Declutter Clutter makes a house look messy, plus it is harder to clean a cluttered room. Grab a washing basketand clear out everything in the rooms you’ll be mostly using that doesn’t need to be there. Banish fridge smells Your fridge will be busier than usual, so place a small plastic tub with some bicarbonate of soda at the back of the middle shelf to keep it odour free. It works as an odour eliminator, all you need is a tiny spoonful of bicarb. Deal with bathroom smells With impending guests and family and friends staying over, bleach the toilet, and keep plenty of spare loo roll available. Leave a dfuser on a shelf to keep the bathroom smelling good throughout the hectic season, add a few drops of your favourite essential oils to the cardboard tube inside the toilet rolland leave an air freshener in there for guests to use. Guest towels Ensure your guests have soft fluffy towels when they arrive. Wash them with your usual detergent but add in a nice big capful of white wine vinegar to bring them back to le and to take away any of that hard crispness towels often have after washing. Get rid of carpet odour Use a mixture of bicarbonate of soda with a little essential oil to sprinkle over your rugs to keep them smelling fresh. Vacuum up.  Stock up on kitchen rollChristmas is a prime time for spillages, so strategically place kitchen rolls all around the dining area, so there’s no excuse! People can soak up any spilt bevvies, plus catch any crumbs from those late-night mince pies.Spillages Spilt candle wax can be easily removed. Cover the wax with a brown paper bag or parcel paper, then use heat applied from your hair dryer or iron to lt off the wax. Then simply wipe away with an old cloth. Wipe away gently so you don’t damage any surface. If you spill nail polish on to your carpet, blot as much as you can to remove excess nail polish. Then, using a microfibre cloth, apply a small amount of window cleaner to the stain and scrub in a circular motion. Rinse the affected area with water. Broken glass trick Smashed glasses  Don’t panic. Grab a slice of bread and soak up the glass pieces with it.  Cooking smells With all the extra baking you are doing, your kitchen may be hanging on to a few food smells. To help banish these, pop a saucepan of water on the hob, add in ml of white wine vinegar and leave to simmer for around  minutes. This will release odour‑fighting power into the air and will help to deodorise the whole house. Burnt food The last thing you want to do is stand and scrub dishes. Make le easier and sprinkle bicarbonate of soda onto your dishes, add boiled water and leave the bicarbonate of soda to do the scrubbing. The bicarbonate will soften the food and burn marks, leaving you with clean baking trays and dishes. Steam cleaning No one wants to be ill at Christmas and the last thing you want is a horrible bug in your home.Steam cleaning is perfect for the winter months: it has so many health benefits. It’s a completely natural, chemical-free and eco-friendly way to eliminate germs and viruses in your home.Not only that, steam cleaning has been proven to improve sleep and make breathing easier for people with respiratory conditions. Clean door handles and surfaces that are going to be used a lot in the kitchen or bathroom.

Neil Campbell and Jo Holbrook-Morris, and their two young kids have been left with just £ a week to live on with Universal Credit .And after mortgage payments, bills, food, clothes and other expenses, they are left with barely any money. Grimsby Live reports they also run a community farm with little support and also have to pay for feed for their animals, including donkeys, pigs and chickens.At the moment we are really struggling, we have put everything that we had into setting up the farm, but due to the delays that we have had with planning, we have been forced onto Universal Credit, Neil said today.Are you a struggling family facing severe poverty  Contact webnews@trinitymirrorThe thing is, the community have really rallied around the farm and embraced it as their own, so we feel that we have to keep things going for them, in the hope that some day we can turn things around. Because we were initially told that our planning application would take just eight weeks, we were given assurances that we could invest in the farm, and then once we did, the application was delayed indefinitely, putting us where we are at the moment. We have had senior officers from the council come to the farm, including the chief executive Rob Walsh, showing it to people as an example of positive work going on the community, because we are helping children from Phoenix House and guiding them in a positive direction to turn their lives around. We have one kid who volunteers there who has given up on earning £ a day drug dealing, because they would rather spend their time looking after and caring for our animals.  The Tory-controlled council insists it is trying to help the struggling family. A hold up in a planning application to expand Nunnyaposs Farm - which would allow it to run as a business and open to the public - means the couple have been unable to unlock grants which have already been approved. A year ago Neil and Jo say they were told the planning application would take just eight weeks by the previous council administration, only for it to now be delayed indefinitely. As a result the couple have had to use their own money to keep the farm running. The couple previously worked in the prison system together for  years, where they saved up money with the goal of setting up a community farm in Grimsby. They now have  animals including donkeys, sheep, pigs, goats and chickens. The Universal Credit is a monthly payment to help with your living costs. You may be able to get ityou’re on a low income or out of work. Universal Credit will encompass all of the following benefits:Child Tax Credit Housing Benefit Income Support income-based Jobseeker’s Allowanceincome-related Employment and Support AllowanceWorking Tax Credit  Jo said that while they have made sure that their kids have presents this Christmas, she and Neil will be going without anything, as they just do not have the money. They have been on Universal Credit since June. She said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without. We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just donapost know how long we can last like this. At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we canapost afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.  Neil said that Centre, who manage the site where the Nunnyaposs Farm is based, have been working hard to address the planning problem. He said: We canapost walk away from the farm now after everything that we have put into it, it just wouldnapost be fair on the community who have embraced us with open arms and ourselves. I just hope that we can get this sorted soon, so that we can get the Nunnyaposs Farm properly up and running. The problem with the application developed after Sport England objected to the expansion as the land where the farm is based was included in the councilaposs playing field strategy. A similar piece of land would have to be found to replace this in the future playing pitch strategy before the objection is lted. Because of this, Neil and Jo have not been able to use grant funding that they have ring fenced for projects, and cannot fully open up the farm to the public.

A cold northerly blast will roar in during the middle of next week with wintry showers possible on the big day. It will follow an unsettled weekend with bouts of strong winds and torrential forecast through until Christmas Eve.Heavy rain threatens flooding across swathes of Britain prompting a raft of Met Officeweather warnings and Environment Agency alerts.A severe weather warning for more heavy rain is in place across southern England from .am on Saturday until noon on Sunday. It warns of potential travel delays and flooding as up to mm of rain is forecast in parts during the warning period. It means those heading home for Christmas could face severe delays. Thermometers will plunge overnight into Christmas morning with a widespread frost expected and slim chance of snow. James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said: We could still see a true White Christmas particularly in northern parts of the country.  A blast of air from the south will push temperatures above-average for winter over the next few days. Low-pressure from the west will give the weather a shake up with heavy rain threatening floods in parts of the country. The weather will start to calm down towards the middle of next week when polar air will make it feel much colder. Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: We are going into quite an unsettled period of weather with low pressure in charge although it will feel milder in the run up to Christmas. After the weekend high pressure will build and although it will be more settled it will turn colder with the arrival of Arctic Maritime air. There will be some showers around on Christmas Eve although Christmas Day is looking drier. There will be some easterly winds along the east coast of the country, to the southwest there will be milder winds coming in from the west. Weather Company meteorologist Amy Hodgson added: Our current forecast favours slightly cooler conditions from Christmas Day, with temperatures dropping marginally below normal as a colder flow from the north-east develops across eastern areas.  On Friday, adverse weather led to the part-closure of the M motorway while several rail lines were blocked. Sussex Police described driving conditions in the region as miserable, and said there was a lot of standing water on the roads. Devon and Cornwall Police said flooding across the force area made a number of roads impassable and it urged motorists to take extra care and avoid driving into standing water. Highways England has urged motorists to adapt their driving for wet weather by slowing down, keeping well back from the vehicle in front and easing off the acceleratorsteering becomes unresponsive.

Florence Widdicombe from Tooting, south London, opened the box of Tesco charity Christmas cards and found a message inside one of the cards. Written in capital letters inside a card with a Santa hat on the front, the note read: “We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China. Forced to work against our will. Please help us and noty human rights organisation.” Tesco has now suspended links with the supplier, saying it abhors the use of prison labour. The boxes of charity Christmas cards will make more than £, for British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK, reports the Sunday Times. Florence said it was a bit funny and I felt a bit shocked when she discovered the message. She was writing cards to school friends last weekend when she read the note that said its author was part of a group of foreign prisoners in Shanghai who were forced to work against their will. She told reporters: We didnapost open them on the day that we got them, we opened them about a week ago. We were writing in them. About on my sixth or eighth card, somebody had already written in it. The final line pleaded with whoever found the note to get in touch with Mr Peter Humphrey, a former British journalist who spent two years behind bars in China, nine of them at the same Qingpu prison. Florenceaposs dad contacted Mr Humphrey who believes the prisoner who wrote the note must have known him before his release from the prison in June . Mr Humphrey contacted other former prisoners and some confirmed they were forced to do manual work. One ex-prisoner confirmed: “They have been packing Christmas cards for Tesco, and also Tesco gt tags, for at least two years. “The foreign prisoners just package the cards. They pick dferent designs, put them into boxes, seal them and pack them into shipping cartons.” A Tesco spokeswoman told PA that the company was shocked and had shut down operations at the facility. We abhor the use of prison labour and would never allow it in our supply chain, a Tesco spokesman said on Sunday. We were shocked by these allegations and immediately suspended the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation. This isnapost the first time notes such as these have been found in goods in the west. In , a letter from an inmate at the Masanjia labour camp in Shenyang, China was found in a box of Halloween decorations in America.

In Iceland, people exchange books on Christmas Eve and in Australia people hit the beaches. But in some countries Christmas is celebrated in a way that might seem strange to outsiders. Japan for instance, is one of them. According to the BBC, it’s estimated that . million Japanese families treat themselves to fried chicken from American fast-food chain KFC in a tradition that has been celebrated in the country for decades. But how did it all start  KFC Japan was initially opened as a joint venture between the fast food giant’s parent company and the Mitsubishi Corporation. After four years of negotiations Mitsubishi was awarded franchise rights to KFC in Japan and the first test store was opened at the Osaka World Expo in March . The fried chicken chain proved to be very successful and the first proper store was opened in Nagoya in November the same year. Despite this KFC was not an immediate hit in Japan. After just one year the relatively small chain found itself saddled with  million yen in debt . This shortcoming led the Mitsubishi Corporation to update its strategy.  KFC’s parent company wanted to locate its stores in suburban areas but Mitsubishi insisted that smaller stores should be opened in cities with larger populations. The plan worked and by  KFC Japan had opened its th store. It wasn’t until December  that KFC Japan started promoting the idea of fried chicken as a Christmas meal. According to Japan Today “The tradition of eating KFC at Christmas started when an expat customer at the chain’s Toyama store observed that, in a land bereft of Yuletide turkey, fried chicken was the next best thing.”  “The store’s canny manager was paying attention and passed word on to the higher-ups, leading the company to launch its ludicrously successful ‘Kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii!’campaign in .” Demand for fried chicken at Christmas soared and the strange tradition had begun. KFC Japan now sees a large portion of its revenue come from the festive season and staff work around the clock to take pre-orders for fried chicken, often weeks in advance. Even on Christmas Eve customers all over Japan can be seen queuing, sometimes for hours, for a “Party Barrel” .

That’s why he has played the majority of our games this season, it’s because he has been excellent.“He has made  appearances and most of them have been starts. For someone so young, I think he holds his own on the pitch and controls the game at times.“There is a lot to him that’s to like. He gives us a balance.

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

The Rural Growth Deal has the potential to take Argyll and Bute further along the road to economic growth and repopulation.#Reversing the population decline that threatens Argyll and Bute’s future has to continue to be the key priority.#There is a solid  for my successor to take up the reins and drive forward progress, putting into action Rural Growth Deal investment the maritime change programme at HM Naval Base Clyde delivering new housing across the area attracting new business investment further closing education attainment gaps developing new models of care improving public protection services – I could go on and on.

Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

I remain steadfast in the Union’s position that in our future EU and international trade agreements there must be no double standards of what is expected of Scottish and UK producers and what is tolerated from imports and their production methods and standards.‘It is not just the economics that is at stake here # there is the triple bottom line of sustainability, social economics and what Scottish farmers and crofters can deliver for the environment including climate change’."},{"url":null,"title":"post election action from nfu scotland","story":"Before the dust of the General Election had settled, NFUS kick-started an extensive programme of engagement with Scotland’s intake of MPs and the new UK government.NFU Scotland has written to every MP in Scotland, inviting them to early meetings to make progress on the  key priorities set out in its election manesto documentThis addresses the pressing Brexit issue, as well as climate change, animal welfare, opportunities for new entrants and food producers’ standing in the supply chain.NFU Scotland will also extend an invitation to the Secretary of State for Scotland, once appointed, to attend and address the upcoming NFU Scotland AGM in February next year.Clare Slipper, NFU Scotland’s political affairs manager, said: ‘With the dust from last week’s election settled, now begins the hard work with Scotland’s representatives in Westminster.‘Let us be clear: NFU Scotland will engage with all MPs, of all parties, to ensure the best outcomes for our membership.‘As well as organising meetings with Scottish MPs, we are also seeking early engagement with key appointments within the government.‘Having looked at the policies within the Conservative’s manesto line-by-line, there are areas of strength and opportunity and other areas that our members will find more challenging.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates.

Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs.

I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created. He highlighted some neighbouring streets had a number of parked cars on them and this could reduce that.He said: ldquoIf you go along Church Street in Dunbar, there is very little parking."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-rocket-engine-testing-site-turned","story":"Skyroras bid to set up a base on the former coal handling plant at Port Seton had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authoritys planning committee today , the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a \"bad neighbour\".Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rockets on the land, which is central to the councils future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: \"This is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.\"Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while they applied for temporary use of the site for five years, they told the planning committee they envisaged the possibility of not just expanding their presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea outlet, to Cockenzie.And while Prestonpans Community Council, which lies on the boundary of the site, supported their move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting this week, Bryan Hickman, from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, pointed to a public meeting which had seen between  and  people turn out.He said: \"Virtually everyone who was there was against it ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.

Accepting this grudgingly, the tanked-up twosome sashay and sway from the comfort of the bar, out into the night, where the winter wind slaps them hard across their faces, like a temperance campaigner confronting a pair of naughty bootleggers in prohibition Chicago.Our booze hounds are feeling the pain, alright. But, lo, whatrsquos this they spy  An open door. And a shimmering light emanates from that door. Crossing the threshold theyrsquore confronted by celestial music wafting down a steep staircase. The music draws the men forward. Upward. Climbing the staircase, they enter a room of chanting, dancing, frolicking and blissed-out fervour.Have they perhaps died of alcoholic poisoning on this dreich and rain-dappled Glasgow evening  Slipped the mortal coil and entered the heavenly realm Nope. The drunken duo have accidentally stumbled into OM Sweet OM, a Hare Krishna Centre in Glasgows Oswald Street, where a gathering of the faithful are in full chant mode. Irsquom one of the gang, as it happens, chanting along with about  other people. This being my first time, Irsquove not quite reached the state of transcendental ecstasy everyone  seems to have tuned into with ease.Which is probably why I immediately spot the drunks staggering into the room. And I must admit theyrsquore making me feel more than a wee bit uncomfortable. Whatthe booze bruvs start getting brash, boisterous, bolshiehellip or worse OK, wersquove got them outnumbered,  to two. Butit comes down to a fight, theyrsquove got inebriation on their side. All wersquove got is spiritual enlightenment. And, quite frankly, in a scrap booze beats beatic bliss. Every time.No Morris Dancers hereLuckily the night doesnrsquot turn violent. The drunks wobble amongst us for a while, their eyes wide like small children watching a particularly trippy episode of In The Night Garden. At one point they stagger over to one of the mantra chanters, who happens to be blind, and start to pet her guide dog.But thatrsquos as tactile as they get. Mostly they just stare. And therersquos plenty to stare at. Before arriving at OM Sweet OM, Irsquod assumed Hare Krishna chanting would be laidback and passive. Itrsquos not. For a start, therersquos musical accompaniment. And I donrsquot mean the wispy twang of a solitary sitar. Blokes are playing lead and bass electric guitars while drums provide a hypnotic dance beat.And, yes, plenty of people are getting into the groove. They arenrsquot performing some sort of heavily stylised dance ritual. No Morris dancers here. What Irsquom witnessing is essentially a bunch of rave-heads letting rip. The dancers gain energy and exuberance by grinning manically at each other. Coke-heads behave in a similar manner, though no illicit substances have passed anyonersquos lips this night.At times the dancing morphs into an Eastern version of a ceilidh. The movers and groovers weave in and out of each otherrsquos giddy embrace. All the while the chant continues: ldquoHare Krishnahellip Hare KrishnahellipAt the beginning of the evening I was told the chanting helps focus the mind on the immediacy of the moment. The person meditating is freed from the anguish of the past and concerns over the future. Although Irsquom enjoying the party atmosphere, Irsquom struggling to attain that desired state of being. I remain doggedly attached to my multitude of petty concerns. Even when the drunks leave, as eventually they do, I still find my mind chained to me. Therersquos just no escaping myself.Though to be honest, even without the distraction and enticement of a greasy lump of meat speared on a prong, Irsquod still be hard-pressed to keep my mind focused on spiritual matters. Therersquos no getting away from it, Irsquom a gutter-grubbing sorta guy.Otherwise there would be chaosUnlike Ramunas Bucimskas who is a bona fide Hare Krishna monk who also answers to the spiritual name Raghumath. Once the chant and stomprsquos over for the evening, I grab the opportunity to chat to Ramunas, whorsquos originally from Lithuania, though he left to study IT in Scotland. Irsquom curious to knowthere have been any prior drunken invasions into the Hare Krishnarsquos devotional space. Theyrsquore located in a rowdy part of town, after all, surrounded by pubs, clubs and fast food joints. ldquoOccasionally it happens, says Ramunas with a shrug and a relaxed smile. ldquoWe want to keep a safe environment, so we make sure thatpeople accidentally wander in here, they never cross a certain line. If theyrsquore in a friendly mood, wersquore friendly too. If theyrsquore a little more aggressive, then we have to be a little bit firm and ask them to leave.He adds: ldquoOf course wersquore a peaceable group, but we recognise that a certain level of violence is necessary in society. Thatrsquos why we have a police department, which we support. Otherwise there would be chaos.In other words,things had got really out of hand Ramunas would have called the cops rather than attempting to fend off the intruders by thrusting a locally-sourced radish in their faces. Irsquom glad to hear it.Beatic, Beatlish blissRamunas proceeds to tell me about the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the organisation behind the OM Sweet OM centre. Itrsquos the same group that George Harrison, that most contemplative of Beatles, supported and promoted throughout much of his le. They teach a brand of Hinduism focusing on yoga, meditation, mindfulness, mantra, music and a plant-based diet.In the early s, counterculture figures such as the beat poet Allen Ginsberg were attracted to their belief system. By that decadersquos end it wouldnrsquot have been entirely far-fetched to label Krishna Consciousness the official religion of the hippies. The musical Hair even had the cast belting out the Hare Krishna mantra.But Irsquom no hippy, and as I admit to Ramunas, I struggled to tap into the spiritual angle of the evening. Does this mean I wasted my time meditating ldquoNot at all, he says. ldquoOf course we offer spiritual guidance. But there are many people who donrsquot have any spiritual beliefs whatsoever. But they practice mediation with us anyway. It helps them on a physical level and makes them feel much healthier.So did I leave feeling healthier  Indeed I did. For all of two minutes. The precise amount of time it took me to stride down the stairs of OM Sweet OM, turn left on Oswald Street, and bound into the kebab shop that had been enticing me all evening. Ten minutes after that, I wasnrsquot feeling healthy at all.I guess itrsquos safe to say that I havenrsquot reached the George Harrison plane of beatic, Beatlish bliss quite yet."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-born-lose","story":"WATCHING Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson march side-by-side into Parliament this week ndash one grim, one grinning ndash was a stark reminder that the lottery of le is all about winners and losers.

This is the first step towards bringing agricultural beasts back and using them to improve the conditions of the productive land on the island.As well as paving the way towards the reintroduction of farming activities, the cows presence is hoped to help boost bioersity and help support corncrakes and rare species such as the Slender Scotch Burnett Moth.Subtle signs of activity on Ulva come  months after the island celebrated a controversial pound. million community ownership deal largely funded by public money.Some argued it was a harsh day for the islandrsquos owner, Jamie Howard. Recently widowed and whose family had owned Ulva for three generations, his hope to sell to his preferred bidder was removed from his hands by Scottish Government community land reform rules.Others, however, embraced the move as a new dawn for an island which had suffered at the hands of th and th-century owners.In , the population of Ulva and neighbouring Gometra ndash attached by a narrow bridge ndash stood at . Within seven years it would slump to a mere  and by the s, Ulva, a favourite spot for Beatrix Potter, Sir Walter Scott and visited by James Boswell and Dr. Samuel Johnson, would have just seven families left, with crofts abandoned and properties in ruins.Since the change of ownership, however, interest has soared among people keen to visit and, perhaps surprisingly for a remote spot with no car ferry, school, shop or roads, to set up home.Recently a survey by the North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which as a result of last yearrsquos community buyout owns Ulva, revealed its population could balloon by , per centall applications to become its newest residents were accepted.More than  people have lodged their interest in living on the island: a challenge, given there are currently just a handful of residential properties and no infrastructure other than a single restaurant ndash The Boathouse ndash to support them.There are, however, big plans. And the arrival of the Highland cattle, says Ms Reid, are just the start.By next summer, the six residential properties are expected to have been fully refurbished. The plan includes the restoration of a Thomas Telford-designed manse, built in the s and long abandoned, and there have been hints that its neighbouring church could one day become a music venue.Further ahead, there has been talk of a proper campsite, mini-hotel and hostel for tourists who want to extend their visit, an oyster farm and shops.

For a start, volunteers have tackled the overgrown walled garden at Ulva House which, until the buyout, was the fine B-listed mansion home to the Howard family.Plans for the house are said to include refurbishing half to become a high-quality self-catering property which would fund the running of an interpretation and educational centre in the other half.Further plans are understood to focus on the development of infrastructure to support house plots for sale and self-build and for the construction of rented accommodation.If the cattlersquos recent arrival signies a giant leap towards theof an agricultural sector on the island, there is another sign of a new era.Sheila MacFadyen was a dairy maid for the Clark family, Ulvarsquos owners until the mid-th century.

He finally made it through to the most exquisite box, designed by Timorous Beasties, the award-winning Glasgow-based textile design studio.His face lit up as he pulled back the ribbon to unveil a beautul bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label Timorous Beasties Edition, with a matching design to the box. The box illustrates flora and fauna found across the four corners of Scotland in a cool blue hue, which complements the golden shade of the whisky. Ramsay couldnrsquot quite believe it ndash even more so when he was informed that the bottle was worth a hefty pound.And that wasnrsquot all. We had another surprise up our sleeve ndash courtesy of Diageo, the maker of Johnnie Walker ndash in the form of a personalised bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label, inscribed with Ramsayrsquos name.At this point Marion pitched in. ldquoHis name is actually Andrew, which caused a slight panic .ldquoBut he prefers to go by Ramsay because his father had the same name.A sigh of relief briskly followed.Looking like a child in a sweetshop, Ramsay clasped his two bottles in awe for a good few minutes, before having a rather comical photoshoot in his own living room. With an arm around his we, he held the two bottles of fine Scotch with a cheeky grin.ldquoIrsquove never won anything in my le so Irsquom amazed, he said. ldquoBut I like a nice whisky, he laughed.The couple have been married for  years and have lived in the same house in Cumbernauld for  of those. And Ramsay didnrsquot take too lightly to a reminder that the pair married the same year as England won the World Cup. ldquoDonrsquot rub that in! he jested.In their spare time, they enjoy spending time with their three grandchildren, who often come round for dinner. ldquoWersquore down there a few days a week, Marion said, to see Hannah , Harriet,  and Evan, .Ramsay is a loyal Herald reader. ldquoI buy it every day, he said. ldquoIrsquove read the paper the same number of years wersquove been married, or a few more.That days edition was on the coffee table in the living room when we dropped in for a visit. The newsagent round the corner even keeps a copy for Ramsay every day.ldquoHersquos been reading the Herald since before you were even born, joked Marion with a cheeky nod to me.Marion said she hoped Ramsayrsquos th birthday ndash and his stroke of good luck ndash was a lovely end to what had been ldquoa tough year, with health issues meaning meant her husband was in and out of hospital.After our visit, the couple were heading out to lunch, and they plan to celebrate with a whole family dinner in January.As for having a dram of his rare luxury whisky, when would the time come  ldquoProbably tonight,\" Ramsay laughed.bull Ramsay wasnt the only winner in our fantastic competition.

No windows, no roof, no mirrors, not even a steering wheel and with brakes that were optional, signicantly raising the risk should the driver suddenly find themselves heading rapidly downhill.There was a high chance of breaking your wrist on the tiller and the wire wheels had a rather disturbing habit of buckling on corners, throwing the unfortunate occupants on to the road.Scotlandrsquos early motor cars may only have reached a less than hair-raising mph, but those who dared to climb into the rickety horseless carriage of an Argyll Voiturette were almost certainly in for the ride of their lives.It was early , and Scots were about to fall deeply in love with the thrills but hopefully not the spills of motoring, in vehicles carefully hand-built using the best of Scottish engineering skill and technology.Scottish car manufacturing ndash a stop-start affair at the best of times ndash ground to an emergency stop in  when the sprawling Linwood car plant, created in the sixties to churn out countless Hillman Imps, finally closed.Now, a group of Dundee-based motoring enthusiasts is set to relaunch Scottish car manufacturing, with the unveiling of a new sports car designed and built in the city.The lightweight fibreglass-bodied ADO Coupe takes its retro style from a  design for a sporty model intended to replace the iconic MG Midget but which never made it into production.Designed as a modern ldquogreen machine with plans for an electric engine and recycled structure ndash with options to upgrade the engine power for racing enthusiasts ndash the ADO Coupe is thought to be the first car to be made from scratch in Scotland since production halted at the Linwood site.The brainchild of car enthusiast Douglas Anderson, designer Richard Oakes and former Jaguar designer Clark Dawson, it will also become the first vehicle manufactured in Dundee.ldquoI think it is a work of art and pretty sensational, says Anderson, who dreamed of being a car designer since his youth but was thwarted by a lack of opportunities in the Scottish motor manufacturing sector.While the price hasnrsquot been revealed, each ADO Coupe will be built to order ndash not unlike the early Argyll, Albion and Arrol-Johnston horseless carriages which first introduced Scotland to the convenience, relative ldquocomfort and ease of motor car travel.It was, according to Bob James, a guide and research volunteer at Glasgowrsquos Riverside Museum, a fairly bumpy start and one which, unfortunately for those working in the sector, would struggle to really hit top gear.ldquoGlasgow was awash with great engineers, he says. ldquoBut Scotland was probably too far away from the main centres for car manufacturing to make much senseldquoEventually we were losing steel works, aluminium works and engineering skills.ldquoThere was the prospect of lorries having to drive  miles to deliver components to build a car here and the costs increased to a point where it didnrsquot make financial sense.And yet Scottish car manufacturing had set off at a roaring pace at the dawn of the th century when, inspired by the French motor vehicle market, the first all-Scottish cars slowly rolled off the production line.ldquoUntil then, government legislation had protected the toll road owners, the canals and railways which had lobbied strongly saying they couldnrsquot have cars on the road.ldquoThe French were well ahead of us, and there came a point when the British couldnrsquot ignore what was happening any longer, he adds.The change saw a mini-boom in Scottish car-making, led by the ldquoAs ndash Argyll, Arrol-Johnston and Albion, all Glasgow-based manufacturers which brought motorised vehicles to the nationrsquos streets.Leading the way was Springburn locomotive engineer George Johnston, and Forth Bridge engineer Sir William Arrol, who had the first British-built motor car ready to hit the road as the century drew to a close.The Arrol-Johnston six-seater ldquoDogcart, a wood-bodied vehicle started by the pull of a rope, rolled off the production line at a factory at Camlachie on a site close to Celtic Park in Glasgowrsquos east end.Arrol-Johnston vehicles were eventually found on roads around Britain. However, an unfortunate episode which saw its  Victory model sold to the Prince of Wales only to break down during a royal tour brought unwelcome publicity, and the firm folded in .Meanwhile, competition had come from rival Albion, formed in  by two former Arrol-Johnston engineers and with production beginning in a first-floor factory in Glasgowrsquos Finnieston Street. By , however, the business had shted to Scotstoun to cater for emerging demand for lorries and delivery vehicles.A more chequered future, meanwhile, awaited Argyll Motors.Launched in , its Argyll Voiturette was an almost identical copy of a Louis Renault motor car, painstakingly handmade at a former bicycle factory in Hozier Street, Bridgeton.ldquoIt was very basic and looked like a big pram on giant wheels with a very light metal chassis, adds Bob James.ldquoThe gear box, engine and wheels would be built and then it would be a case of finding a body to fit on it. That meant going to old carriage coachbuilders who would adapt horse-drawn coach and carriages to fit on top of the body.The result was a vehicle that occupants didnrsquot so much sit ldquoin but sit perched on top of, he adds.Not surprisingly, there were accidents. ldquoThe Western Infirmary archives have descriptions of ious injuries inflicted on people who had crashes in their cars, he continues.ldquoIt was very common for people to get badly hurt or killed when they were lsquoejectedrsquo from their car.ldquoThe wire wheels would bucklethe driver took a corner too hard and the passengers would be flipped out. Another common injury was caused by the tiller.Two upright rods which were used to steer, the tiller could easily sht suddenly and snap the unfortunate driverrsquos wrist.Argyll Motorsrsquo demise followed the decision to lavish money on the construction of a new factory in Alexandria. ldquoIt was a vast, palatial factory where they planned to build the best cars in the world, he adds.ldquoThey went all-out but while Argyll sold cars in Russia, Japan and Australia, they focused too much on the world market and didnrsquot look after their money.Eventually the expense of constructing the showpiece factory and a sht in demand saw the business stutter and close in .While other smaller manufacturers sprang up around the central belt, including the Madelvic Motor Carriage Company in Edinburgh ndash a specialist in electric vehicles, the derelict factory still stands today ndash none survived.And it would be decades before vehicle manufacturing on a signicant scale ed to Scotland.The pound million Rootes factory in Linwood began production of the Hillman Imp in  and employed over , people at the plant and surrounding suppliers.However, production of the rear-engine Imp ended in . The factoryrsquos new owners, Peugeot-Citroen, ordered its closure in .While a handful of kit car businesses exist, the ADO Coupe is thought to be the first Scottish-designed and manufactured vehicle for a generation.ldquoWe are starting small but we have already got a few customers and the first one should be on the road in early summer next year, adds Anderson. ldquoIt is a bit of a dream come true.The ADO Coupe is being developed at a workshop on the outskirts of Dundee with ious specialist elements of its manufacture to be sub-contracted to local and national suppliers.Its retro body is based on a  prototype sports car developed by BMC as a possible new style of MG Midget. However, the car, which featured a distinctive sloping back end, was never made.Prospective buyers of the Dundee-made ADO Coupe will be able to specy certain design elements, including interior, suspension and engine specications.The vehicle will be available as a road-going vehicle, or as a shell which can be adapted for the race-track. As well as being supplied ready-built, there are also plans to offer it in kit form for car-lovers to build themselves.The designers also have plans to explore using recycled materials to create the bodywork, and electric engines."},{"url":null,"title":"How Britain   39 woke  39  up in 2019     and what we saw wasn  39 t nice","story":"ldquoWoke only entered the Oxford English Dictionary last year as meaning ldquoalert to racial or social discrimination and injustice.

Thankfully, Emu wasnrsquot with me at the time. They are flightless birds and the fall would undoubtedly have killed us both.God, however, had a plan. Upon my rather abrupt arrival in Heaven, he honoured my sacrice ndash making me the UKrsquos patron saint of football. Yes, I may have missed the match that fateful night, but Irsquove seen every game thatrsquos taken place on British soil since. For my omnipresent transdimensional essence now hovers over every UK fixture ndash reporting any trouble back to God.The Scottish leagues may not always fall under my remit, however. According to God, independence is inevitable ndash and I admit I wouldnrsquot feel comfortable working in a country thatrsquos rejected the hierarchic dominance of your English superiors. And also ungratefully turned its back on Her Majestyrsquos matriarchal devotion to this great nationrsquos wellbeing ndash an unconditional love which exceeds that of our own mothers.God only knowsOF course, your nationrsquos lack of reverence for the authoritative tiers of privilege and inherited wealth isnrsquot the only reason I hope to be relived of my duties in Scotland.You Jocks have no idea how embarrassing it is for an English gentleman like myself to report back to God and have to repeat the colourful language favoured by your supporters ndash particularly at ldquoOld Firm matches. Itrsquos also exhausting having to google all the countless references to religious sects, ancient battles and subsequent grievances to understand what the hell is going on.For the record, I can confirm God is especially displeased at how His favourite song ndash Neil Diamondrsquos Sweet Caroline ndash has been reborn as a blasphemous hate anthem by aggrieved Presbyterians. Hersquos particularly infuriated at never being able to listen to the chorusrsquo sweet descending horn melody again without hearing a suggestion of illicit fornication with the spiritual leader of Catholicism.Yet, thatrsquos nothing compared to how infuriated He is over a rather unsavoury incident which took place last Sunday afternoon at Parkhead. As usual, I was idly floating over the stadium, keeping a particularly close eye on the famous North Curve section, when I spotted a large banner which boldly exclaimed ldquoF*** off Rod in a strange retro-futuristic font.Now, I was under the impression that I was carrying out these duties under the auspices of anonymity. Surely God would have told methe Pope had announced to the world that I had been canonised And evensupporters knew the Eurosceptic spirit of Rod Hull was watching over them, I was under the impression Celtic was a club which took pride in its historic ldquoopen for all stance. So I looked again. No, there it was ndash ldquoF*** off Rod. And to add insult to injury, a second banner pronounced, in the same queasily homespun Blakes  font: ldquoTories not welcome.Now, thatrsquos taking it too far. Sturgeon did well last week whipping up your ingrained inferiority complex but for the moment, Scotland is still just a whipping boy bleeding oil to grease the wheels of the English Treasury.It seems the SNPrsquos failed education policies have left you with a generation unfit to shove their hand up Emursquos a*** never mind run a country. I mean, these days the Clydersquos last remaining shipyard struggles to make rubber ducks float and you even had to get the Germans in to bring trams back to Edinburgh. Winston Churchill would bloody weep.Rod the prod NOW, I was a much-loved entertainer in le ndash so did not immediately assume it was me being told to ldquoF*** off when I saw the Celtic supportersrsquo banner. Yet, what other Rod could it possibly be The only other famous Rod ndash apart from Jane and Freddiersquos pal ndash is Rod Stewart. And it certainly couldnrsquot be him that the Green Brigade were telling to f*** off!I mean, theyrsquove known for decades that Rodrsquos a shameless unionist who almost broke his knees with the speed he got down on the palace floor to accept a knighthood. And letrsquos not forget Maggie May explicitly described a young Rodrsquos erotic liaison with The Iron Lady above her parentsrsquo shop.So, of course, it had to be me they were telling to f*** off ndash because the fans who held that disgusting banner aloft have historically had little issue with Rod Stewartrsquos multarious affiliations. And, I mean, they themselves have indirectly supported the Tory party through purchases of season tickets, strips, scarves and Bovril ndash with Celticrsquos majority shareholder billionaire Dermot Desmond being a generous Conservative donor. And then therersquos former director Lord Ian Livingston, who voted in favour of Tory tax credit cuts.The fans were certainly raging at Ian at the time, with a , strong petition urging him to f*** off, so surely any cancellation of Rod Stewart would have happened years ago too  The bagpipe solo in Rhythm Of My Heart alone justies lelong exile, but what about the time Rod shamelessly performed at Sun City in South Africa during apartheid  Or the countless times hersquos played Israel  Or persevering with hairspray and straighteners at  Blonde ambitionNO, I donrsquot believe Celtic fans were at all shocked that Rod would favourBoris Johnson over Jeremy Corbyn.Theyrsquove surely grown used to Rodrsquos non-partisan personality and wouldnrsquot be surprised when he congratulated Borison his electoral landslide. Yet, wecanrsquot judge a man by the company he keeps, can we We all have our flaws and Rod likely has a word when this fellow millionaire Londoner skewers the Scots, Irish, the working class, the Muslims, the disabled, the LGBT, the hairdressers and the people of Liverpool.And Celtic fans were certainly aware that Rod was also an acquaintance oftoxic insanity bucket Donald Trump. Of course, he says he doesnrsquot really see eye to eye with him on politics, but surely that just leaves two other sides of his personality ndash misogyny and madness. Still, Irsquom sure Rod is disgusted when his pal mocks, demonises and locks up societyrsquos most vulnerable in the relentless pursuit of the almighty dollar and elevated societal status among fellow demons.So it seems pretty clear to me that it couldnrsquot have been Rod Stewart who invoked the Green Brigadersquos wrath. It begs the question, however ndash of both Rods, why choose Rod Hull to f*** off  I mean, the only thing we have in common is that we both like having a bird on our arm.Hierarchy of hateAT LEAST the Tories arent as bad as Trump ndash I mean, they refused to let UKIPrsquos former token Jock MEP David Coburn join them last week - with their Scottishleader Jackson Carlaw essentially telling him to ldquof*** off Parkhead-style by revoking his shiny new membership card.Like Rod, David congratulated Boris and assumed his assimilation to the Tory hive mind was a mere formality. Carlaw, however, stressed that historical comments made by Coburn were \"incompatible with membership and red-carded him. Unlike career antagonist Tommy Robinson, who claims he was enthusiastically welcomed to the fold last week, along with thousands of Britain First members who were urged to join up ndash by their own party.Itrsquos fortunate for Carlaw that hersquos never put a foot wrong himself and can make such character judgements without hypocrisy. Unless yoursquore counting such trivial discrepancies such as his support for the \"rape clause\" policy on child tax credits, that time he made fun of Chinese accents, his singling out of Muslim MSPs to demand they condemn anti-Semitism and, famously, his loathing of Gaelic road signs.Of course, it could be said that he is a minor, inconsequential Tory henchman in comparison to his boss Boris, a congealed blockage in Billy Idolrsquos drain who himself has left no minority group unmocked.So,Coburn was deemed morally unfit to join Team Boris, surely that means he must be some kind of irredeemable puddle demon  Then again, perhaps not.

Ever since coming into power in , Modirsquos ruling Bharatiya Janata Partyhas persistently introduced measures to further marginalise the countryrsquos Muslim population.To an increasing number of Indians such moves, they warn, are part of an unspoken agenda to ide the country along communal lines.ldquoIt is not a fight only for Muslims, Mohammad Hamza, an -year-old university student was quoted by the Washington Post as saying. ldquoIt is a fight to save our country. Modi is trying to break us.At the heart of these potentially incendiary moves by the government lies a new citizenship law.It was on December  that Indiarsquos parliament passed an amendment to its Citizenship Actof , which sets out guidelines for becoming a citizen in the country.The CAA that was then signed into law by Indiarsquos president allows persecuted minorities a fast-track route to Indian citizenship. The law applies to immigrants from nearby Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who are Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Jain, Zoroastrian, or Buddhist.Muslims, however, are not included eventhey are Ahmadis, members of a sect of Islam that Pakistan considers heretical.The law also ignores what the UN has deemed the worldrsquos most persecuted minority, the Rohingya Muslims, who suffered ethnic and religious cleansing at the hands of the Burmese military in Myanmar. The authorities in India have reportedly pledged to deport the estimated , Rohingya refugees residing in the country, even though theyrsquore thought to face danger in their home state.Those opposed to the law say the exclusion of Muslims betrays a deep-seated bias against the community, which makes up % of the countryrsquos . billion people. They argue rightly that the new law would violate Article  of the Indian Constitution, which promises equality as a fundamental right. In prior cases, the Indian Supreme Court has ruled that such fundamental rights are not subject to parliamentary amendment.These opponents are now taking a stand and making their rejection of the law clear. On the streets of  cities across  states, students supported by ordinary citizens came out in huge numbers to protest. Most were undeterred by a brutal police response that took the lives of protesters in the state of Assam, and the cities of Lucknow and Mangalore. At least  people have been killed in violent clashes and the seriousness of the situation was underlined on Friday when six people died and dozens were injured in Uttar Pradesh.In recent days, Indiarsquos government has sought to clamp down on the protests. Yesterday, in response to the escalating crisis, Modi called a meeting with his council of ministers to discuss security measures. Previously, in an attempt to reassure citizens, Modi had taken to social media to deliver his message.ldquoI want to assure my brothers and sisters of Assam that they have nothing to worry after the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill. I want to assure them ndash no-one can take away your rights, unique identity and beautul culture. It will continue to flourish and grow, Modi tweeted on December  amid violent protests in the north-eastern state following the passing of the bill.The only problem in delivering such a message was that the internet was shut down in Assam that day, making it unclear just how many citizens would have had the opportunity to read Modirsquos rather duplicitous reassurance.Time and again as part of its security crackdown the government has arbitrarily turned off the internet across wide swathes of India.Muslim-majority Kashmir has been offline since August, when the Indian government universally revoked Article  of Indiarsquos constitution that guaranteed special rights to the Muslim-majority state, including the right to its own constitution and autonomy to make laws on all matters except defence, communications and foreign affairs.In all, the latest internet shutdown last week marked the th time the it had been shut down in India this year, a measure of Modirsquos increasingly authoritarian rule. In many states and cities, gatherings of four or more people have been prohibited ndash these include parts of Delhi, the software hub of Bengaluru, and the entire state of Uttar Pradesh, home to  million people.Hundreds have been arbitrarily detained, including some of Indiarsquos prominent public intellectuals.ldquoThis piece of legislation strikes at the heart of the Constitution, seeking to make India another country altogether, prominent historian Ramachandra Guha wrote in an Indian newspaper, The .ldquoIt is thus that so many people from so many dferent walks of le have raised their voices against it, he added. Guha made his comments just after his release from police custody after being detained for protesting against the law in the southern city of Bengaluru.Given the prevailing uneasiness that has existed over some of Modirsquos policies for some time, just why did he decide to introduce such controversial and provocative legislation right now According to Sumit Ganguly, professor of political science at Indiana University and a specialist on India, the answer is more complex than it might first appear.Superficially he says it can be argued that the BJP, as a right-wing Hindu nationalist party with a clear-cut parliamentary majority, is simply implementing its ideological agenda and enacting the very proposals it included in its campaign manesto.But this, Ganguly adds, fails to fully recognise the extent to which the party has evolved into ldquoa radical entity bent on transforming the ideological foundations of the Indian state.ldquoAfter five years in office as a majority party from  to , it has promoted the steady rise of a virulent, all-consuming iant of Hindu zealotry in its midst, Ganguly observed, writing recently for the US based magazine Foreign PolicyldquoThis has taken place under the tutelage of Modi and his ideological alter ego Amit Shah, the current minister of home affairs and the principal architect of the citizenship amendment bill, he added.Therersquos no doubt that time and again the top leaders of the BJP have made clear their determination to crack down on Muslim immigrants as part of their wider strategy of discrimination.ldquoA Bharatiya Janata Party government will pick up infiltrators one by one and throw them into the Bay of Bengal, Amit Shah is reported to have said in a speech in April, referring to Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh as ldquotermites.Speaking just this month he repeated such threats, saying: ldquoI assure you that before the national election in , I will throw them all out.One of many tools at the governmentrsquos disposal to act on such threats is the National Register of Citizens . In September, . million residents of north-eastern Assam state learned their names were excluded from the register, putting them at risk of becoming stateless.The NRC is meant to track Indian nationals living in Assam, which experienced waves of mass migration in  when India became independent and in  when East Pakistan became Bangladesh.Many of those excluded from Assamrsquos register were Hindus. But as journalist and writer Ravi Agrawal, author of India Connected recently pointed out, with the new citizenship act Hindus can potentially claim they are immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan and gain a route to citizenship.Muslims, on the other hand, could be at risk of being declared foreignersthey canrsquot produce documentation.Not surprisingly, such blatantly discriminatory moves have created the current backlash against Modirsquos government and BJP rule eventhe party continues to have substantial support across India.Faced with the escalating unrest, some politicians have begun distancing themselves from the next part of the governmentrsquos agenda.The governing parties in two Indian states which both voted in favour of the citizenship law have since indicated that they will not implement a national register of citizens in their states.The government should ldquopause, take corrective measures and retract in light of public anger, Pavan Varma, a spokesman for a regional party in the state of Bihar and an ally of Modirsquos ruling BJP told the Washington Post.While in the past right-wing ideologues have gleefully declared that Modirsquos party had ldquodemolished the theory of a Muslim veto on who ruled in India, backtracking like this suggests attitudes might just be changing.It was bestselling Indian author and columnist Chetan Bhagat, once a staunch supporter of Modirsquos government who perhaps best caught the current shting mood when he wrote on Twitter recently: ldquoThose who fantasise about India with a Hindu king and his subservient subjects, remember thisthinsp ... you canrsquot wish m Muslims away. Last week, following the escalating protests, Bhagat was even more succinct: ldquoLooks like Revolution  is coming after all.Both Modi and Shah, however, are unlikely to cower in the face of such dissent. But while the government for now shows few signs of compromising let alone giving way, analysts say the current protests remain unparalleled in recent Indian history and therefore continue to pose a real political challenge.ldquoThis is the first time we have such widespread, nationwide protests that are not against corruption, but essentially protests against discrimination, said Zoya Hasan, a retired political scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.For Muslims, the citizenship law is ldquothe thin edge of the wedge, Hasan told the Washington Post. ldquoThis is the first time that they think they are actually being subordinated.So what then is likely to happen next  No official public opinion polls have been carried out on the citizenship law, which makes it dficult to gauge just how much support there actually is for the measure.In addition Modirsquos support base should never be underestimated given that he was ed with a landslide majority for another five-year term just last May.That said, there is little doubt that the citizenship law has rankled many Indians even among his supporters.Recently, Neerja Chowdhury, a political commentator and regular columnist for The Times of India, perhaps spoke for many Indians when she observed that ldquoone gets the sense that Modi, in his second term, is overreaching in some way.While petitions challenging the new citizenship act have already been filed in Indiarsquos Supreme Court, it may take months before hearings begin, and itrsquos anyonersquos guess which way the court may rule.Meantime, Modirsquos hold on power remains firm, but the protests at home and abroad have demonstrated limits to how far Indians will allow him to go in pursuit of his Hindu-nationalist agenda.At the moment the most pressing question is the extent and for how long protesters will continues to risk their lives and livelihoods to demonstrate against the law.Many, however, remain convinced that what is happening on the streets from the city of Srinagar in the north to Thiruvananthapuram on Indiarsquos southern tip marks a political watershed.ldquoThese protests represent a turning point in the Indian publicrsquos relationship with the Modi regime, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a political scientist at Ashoka University, told the Financial Times on Friday as unrest flared.ldquoUp until now it oscillated between aggressive adulation or frankly fear. The protests have broken that fear.India, it seems, has at last woken up to the threat posed by the government of Narendra Modi.In the best tradition of its founders, Indians today, it seems, will not rest easy until they know that the democratic values held dear remain secure."},{"url":null,"title":"artists called on to light the north for clan","story":"CLAN Cancer Support is calling for artists from across the north-east to create designs for its Light the North trail lighthouses.Over  sculptures will be situated across Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray, Shetland and Orkney in autumn  to raise funds for CLAN.Each lighthouse will be inidually designed and painted by some of the region’s most talented artists, using a iety of materials and artistic techniques.Artists can submit any design, and artists of any age, no matter where they live, are invited to take part.A live event will be held in April where sponsors will choose their favourite design from the artist submissions and successful designers will then be commissioned to paint the sculpture.The three-metre tall lighthouses are being sponsored by iniduals and businesses across the north-east and will be placed on a trail covering the region including the northern isles from September – October .The lighthouses will be auctioned in December .Fiona Fernie, project director said: “We have been overwhelmed by the support of the north-east for Light the North, and already have over  lighthouse sponsors, spread across the whole region, including inidual sponsors, small businesses and large firms.“This next phase of inviting designs is very exciting, and we are looking forward to seeing the immense creativity that exists in the area.”To submit a design, artists should visit lightthenorth.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gillian Martin with Stella Angus\"  Pupil wins MSPs Christmas card competition viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"forever home for tia and sulley","story":"The Scottish SPCA is delighted to have found a loving, permanent home for a mare and her foal, Tia and Sulley.Tia was pregnant when she came into the care of the Aberdeenshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in December  after her owner could no longer care for her.Sulley was born in the centre in May and it was the only home he had ever known.Tia and Sulley found their forever home with mother and daughter, Ria and Alex.

Those talks are critical to the future of our industry.“It is these negotiations that will be the real bread and butter of Brexit for NFU Scotland members.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to the SNP version of events, nationalists and unionists alike entered into the constitutional debate with joy in their hearts. It didn’t matter what side of the debate we were on, we just glad to be involved.The truth is that the independence referendum campaign was an entirely miserable process for anyone who believes in the maintenance of the United Kingdom. For the majority of Scots, the prospect of victory for the nationalists was a source of anxiety, the prospect of Alex Salmond leading a newly independent Scotland a source of grave concern.Of course, the SNP had to spin a version of events which glossed over the uncomfortable truth that ’s vote on the constitution did nothing but create ision.I regret to report that the nationalists are at it again.Since the result of the general election, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has told a story of a Scotland united against a common enemy in the shape of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. So deep is our loathing for the Conservative PM that we demand another referendum on independence. This is a truth against which nobody can argue.Except, that is, for anybody who cares to look at the election result.It is undoubtedly the case that the majority of Scots did not vote for Johnson’s party. Only a quarter of us backed the Conservatives. But it is also the case that only a minority –  per cent of us – backed the SNP. Evenwe include the vote for the party’s fellow nationalists, the Scottish Greens, the vote for pro-independence parties on  December reaches only  per cent.Despite this, Sturgeon and her fellow SNP politicians have spent the past week arguing that she has a mandate to hold a second referendum.This is something of a leap. And it comes with the claim that the people of Scotland – whether they are in favour of independence or not – wish to have the right to decide on the matter again.Even though it is nothing of the sort, the election result is, says Sturgeon, evidence that Scots would like the Scottish Government to have the power to call a second independence referendum. Currently, it is the case that the right to permit a referendum on independence resides in Westminster. Sturgeon would like to see that power transferred to Holyroodand she now argues that the nation is firmly behind her.It may well be the case that there exists a substantial number of pro-UK Scots who hanker for the stressful experience of a second independence referendum, but I sincerely doubt this.Sturgeon – who succeeded Salmond promising to be a unying figure in  and has spent the past five years being every bit as monomaniacal as her mentor – will not, I think, win many converts to the cause using the sort of rhetoric she’s deployed in recent days.She has talked of Scotland being held in the Union against its will. You can’t, she says, “lock us in a cupboard and turn the keys and hope everything goes away”.This nonsense might play well with those fully converted to the nationalist cause, but it is, I think, a little shrill \u2028for those yet to be convinced that Scotland’s best future lies in breaking from the UK.If Scots felt, as Sturgeon claims we do, imprisoned in the Union against our will, surely the great majority of us would have backed nationalist parties last week  For the past five years, the First Minister has spun a yarn of unstoppable growing support for independence. Each and every political development has been hailed as proof that increasing numbers of Scots are leaping on the independence charabanc. But the truth is that the numbers remain broadly where they were five years ago. The SNP may have the majority of MPs and MSPs but they have only a minority of voters on their side.During election campaigns, Sturgeon and her team can usually be heard talking about the need to protect the NHS. This is always a policy priority. In the aftermath of votes, however, the only subject deemed worthy of discussion is the constitution.This is hardly surprising, because the fact is that, while the SNP obsesses over a referendum that the majority don’t want, the NHS in Scotland remains in a parlous state.And then there’s the education system which continues to fail large numbers of children who leave school without even the most basic skills in literacy and numeracy. And then there’s Police Scotland, an organisation that lurches from crisis to crisis.There is no shortage of issues which the SNP would rather not discuss while it continues to argue that independence is a panacea.It is, quite simply, the case that, for all her talk of wishing to hold a referendum in , the First Minister remains powerless to do so. She has neither the right to call a referendum nor the numbers required to win one.And so, I suspect, that her language in recent days has been less about bringing the country together behind her nationalist project and more about throwing raw meat to those who are already on board.These have been a frustrating few years for the ardent Scottish nationalists. Promises of a second referendum have come to naught. The momentum described by the First Minister has not materialised.Of course, committed Yes voters will argue that the mandate Sturgeon describes is real. But it is not and no amount of magical thinking can change that reality.Sure, Sturgeon may yet change the minds that must be changedindependence is to become the preference of a majority of Scots. And, yes, the presence of Johnson in Downing Street may assist in that process. But, right now, the independence project remains stuck in the mud and no amount of nonsense about a Scotland imprisoned is likely to change that.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gail hurley glasgow pivotal to building a finance system to slow climate change","story":"This year#s UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid has wrapped up, and all eyes will now focus on Scotland as next year#s host of what is arguably the world#s most important international conference.The COP climate change conference will mark five years since the historic Paris Climate Agreement, which committed countries to strengthening actions to combat climate change and limit the global temperature rise this century to below  degrees Celsius. We know, however, that the world is not on track to cut carbon emissions, which must be halved from today’s levels to restrain temperature increases to just . degrees Celsius, the upper limit advised by climate scientists. Progress will need to be ratcheted up by next year.The spotlight is expected to shine on the thorny issue of how to pay for climate damage, and how to mobilise the trillions needed for international climate financing programmes.Financing needed to tackle the climate crisis is estimated to add up to trillions worldwide, and is especially high in the poorest countries and those particularly vulnerable to climate change, such as small island states. The UN estimates a  trillion annual shortfall in investments needed to meet internationally agreed climate and sustainable development goals.A decade ago, industrialised countries pledged to jointly mobilise  billion annually in climate finance by  to address their needs. Yet only bn was raised in , mostly from public sector aid budgets . There is a consensus that more resources need to be mobilised from private markets for climate-friendly investments and to support a “just transition” to net-zero.This is where our work to promote Scotland as a leading international centre for ethical and responsible finance comes in. The climate emergency has underscored the urgency of building a financial system that has better outcomes for people and planet at its heart. The work at the Global Ethical Finance Initiative , headquartered in Edinburgh, builds on Scotland’s proud heritage in ethical finance and financial services, to convene the world’s foremost political, business and civic leaders to define and shape the transition to a sustainable financial system.Within the financial services sector, interest has increased signicantly over recent years in the ways it can look beyond short-term profit and shareholder value towards how it can drive positive social, economic and environmental impact. This has led to a plethora of new initiatives and financial products, such as ethical investment funds, sustainability bonds , and the development of UN-led Principles for Responsible Investment. Globally, the impact investment market is increasingly popular and is now estimated at over bn .At this year’s climate conference, the European Union unveiled its “Green New Deal” intended to transform Europe’s economy and eliminate its contributions to climate change by . Scotland is even more ambitious: this year it adopted landmark legislation to become a net zero society by , and to reduce emissions by  per cent by . Delivering a green transformation that will support employment creation, build skills, boost wages and trigger technological advances will require building a new generation of infrastructure and industries. In addition to well-planned public expenditure that can crowd-in private investment, banks will need to ensure they are able to provide the kinds of financing needed to support this transformation. Aligning their business strategies with society’s goals will in turn help them leverage new business opportunities and remain competitive with the emergence of the sustainable development economy.Finance can be a positive force for change. As we enter a “decade of action” on climate and sustainable development, COP in Glasgow in  provides an opportunity for Scotland to showcase its important work to accelerate the transformation towards a socially responsible and inclusive financial system – one that serves both people and planet.Gail Hurley is Senior Consultant, Global Ethical Finance Initiative, and former senior adviser to the UN©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

At the time his decision was said to have left moderate Labour colleagues “stunned and furious in equal measure”.Since the result of the election, Jeremy Corbyn has also said he will stand down as leader in the New Year and, as a result, the contest for both positions will run at the same time.While no candidates have yet officially declared, a number have been rumoured to want to stand, notably Angela Rayner, Dawn Butler and Richard Burgon – all shadow ministers on the Corbynite wing of the party. Conor McGinn, Khalid Mahmood and Barry Gardiner are also likely to stand.However, Scotland on Sunday has learned that party members are urging Murray, who retained his Edinburgh South seat and for the second time in four years is the sole Labour MP in Scotland, to also run for the role.McDougall said: “There’s a feeling after the Scottish party was thrown under a bus by the UK leadership, that someone needs to educate the UK party of the reality of Scottish politics.“The general election was extraordinary –we had spent the entire time talking about a hung parliament and what we would give the LibDems, people would have thought we were mad, but that’s what we’ve done with the SNP in the last two elections.“Ian would be brilliant. He knows how to win and is a great politician. It would also be good to have someone there reminding people we were the party that saved the Union.”A party source said it would make sense for Murray to stand. “Labour’s position in Scotland has never been worse, so to ensure that Scotland is at the forefront of Labour thinking as we face another battle over independence, this would be a sensible thing to do.“Ian represents Scots with Labour values who want to remain in the Union and are pro-European. There is no doubt about where he stands on these issues, so it would remove the idea that the party is too weak on the biggest matters facing Scotland. He’s also a proven winner.”Another party source added: “It’s essential that there is a Scottish voice in the leadership debate. The only way our party will ever be back in power iswe can win seats from the south of England to the north of Scotland.“Some of the biggest questions the Labour Party will face in the coming years will relate to Scotland, and having a Scot as part of the leadership team would show that we are serious when we talk about working for the whole of the UK.” It is understood Murray had no desire to be made the shadow Scottish Secretary by Corbyn– he had previously resigned from the role in  at the same time as a number of others quite Corbyn’s front bench in light of his stance after the EU referendum in . He was also a supporter of Owen Smith in the previous leadership election.For the second time Corbyn has an English MP serving as the party’s shadow Scottish secretary, with Tony Lloyd, MP for Rochdale, replacing Lesley Laird who lost her Kirkcaldy seat at the election.It is not knownCorbyn consulted Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard before appointing Lloyd, but Scotland on Sunday understands that Leonard has still not spoken directly with Murray in the two years since he became leader.A former Labour strategist said: “It is vitalwe are to become electable again that we have moderate people at the top of the party, certainly at least in one of the main leadership positions. Ian Murray is definitely that, and he has the skills required. “Of course he would need the backing of members and unions – and we saw Unite try and have him de-selected during the election, so he could forget any support from that direction, so it will be interesting to see who he does gain support from.”Murray was unavailable for comment.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers ponder law change to fix scotland s crumbling tenements","story":"Holyrood ministers are considering changes to the law which would ensure Scotland#s ageing tenement buildings can be repaired more urgently.Legislative changes being weighed up include the creation of compulsory owners’ associations, mandatory building inspections every five years and a national reserve fund for repairs.In the short term measures to support voluntary change will be taken forward, such as supporting the establishment of owners associations.Housing minister Kevin Stewart said the actions would help to safeguard Scotland’s tenements, ensuring they continue to provide good quality, safe, sustainable and affordable homes.The announcement follows the publication of a report in June by the Scottish Parliamentary Working Group on Tenement Maintenance.Group convener Graham Simpson MSP said in the report: “Nearly a fth of all our housing is pre- – that’s , homes.“Sixty eight per cent of those have disrepair to critical elements and % have critical and urgent repair needs.“Many of these are tenements and they are at a condition clf-edge.“A report to Glasgow councillors last year highlighted that repair bills to some blocks reached well into six figures – sums that are simply unaffordable to most people.”Glasgow alone has , tenements which were built prior to .Mr Stewart said: “These measures reinforce our commitment to support tenement owners and protect such an important part of our national heritage.“While tenements continue to provide good quality, safe, sustainable and affordable homes, this programme of support will help to ensure they are protected and preserved.“Homeowners and landlords in tenements need to fully accept their shared responsibilities for the upkeep of their property to ensure all those living in tenements have good quality homes.”Concerns about the rising cost of repairing Scotland’s tenements were flagged as far back as , when a survey of Edinburgh’s , tenement flats found many were built with lowgrade sandstone that was in danger of erosion.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked. And then have the gall to say that brexiteers didn#t know what they were voting for.Think about this George. If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down. The die is cast for Brexit, at last.Not that long ago the Tories and LibDems opposed the minimum wage, so it will be interesting to see which of Labour#s bold ideas become mainstream next..."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael holds onto his seat ","story":"Alistair Carmichael has been ed as the MP for Shetland and Orkney for a sixth time.The longstanding isles MP won with over , votes, as the SNP were pipped to second place.SNP candidate Robert Leslie garnered , votes compared to Mr Carmichael#s ,.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives came third, Labour fourth and Brexit Party fth, with independent candidate David Barnard coming last.Tory candidate Jenny Fairbairn polled , votes, Labour#s Coilla Drake ,, Robert Smith and anti-monarchy candidate David Barnard garnered  votes.There were  spoiled ballot papers, some of which may have been influenced by campaign by activist Stuart Hill, who called on voters to write #no thanx# across the paper.The result in this constituency is perhaps unsurprising.

They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives. Targeting leave-voting Labour areas seems to have paid off for the Prime Minister.Labour lost  seats on the night, prompting leader Jeremy Corbyn to announce that he intends to stand down.Their candidate Coilla Drake called it a #sad, sad day#.Mr Carmichael also used his acceptance speech to criticise Mr Johnson and his incoming government.#The next five years is going to be a dficult and dangerous for this, our United Kingdom,# he said.The newly re-elected MP, however, ended on an almost hopeful note, focusing on the need for #liberal voices#, unity and solidarity, which he said was #greater than ever before#.The turnout for the Orkney and Shetland election was just under  per cent, with , Northern Isles folk voting. raquoSo , how did the Remain parties# anti-Brexit policies work out for them  Ten years of Tory government, as a direct result.

The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#..."},{"url":null,"title":"challenging year with amazing achievements amenity trust report states ","story":"It has been a busy period for the organisation which has also had a number of well-publicised financial challenges in recent years and is now under new leadership with a focus on effective governance.The review provides a summary of some of the key activities the trust has undertaken over the past financial year.Highlights include the Hans Holbein exhibition which saw the trust exhibit one of the most important artworks ever to come to Shetland.Shetland Amenity Trust chairwoman Ruth Mackenzie.As a lead partner the trust also hosted the Follow The Vikings Roadshow which toured Europe with a professional cast engaging world-wide audiences in our Viking heritage.A range of environmental improvement, natural and cultural heritage projects and services were also delivered for the benefit of Shetland.The trust’s work ranges from Da Voar Redd-up to tree planting, from the Sumburgh Head lighthouse to the museum and archives, and from Shetland Wool Week to the regional archaeology service.The trust’s accounts for   were fully audited and demonstrated that the organisation had managed to reduce its debt by over  per cent from the previous financial year.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered..."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"2 rifles enjoy christmas celebration before","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This marks the st time an American-made, human-rated capsule has landed on land. Watch our live coverage: https:t.co MAYPLDFR pic owuQDsVB— NASADecember , A test dummy named Rosie the Rocketeer — after Rosie the Riveter from the Second World War – rode in the commander’s seat. Also ing were holiday presents, clothes and food that should have been delivered to the space station crew.After seeing this first test flight cut short and the space station docking cancelled because of an improperly set clock on the capsule, Boeing employees were relieved to get the Starliner back.It was the first US capsule designed for astronauts tofrom orbit and land on the ground.Nasa’s early crew capsules all had splashdowns. SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, which made its orbital debut last winter, also aims for the ocean at mission’s end.The astronauts assigned to the first Starliner crew – two from Nasa and one from Boeing – were part of the welcoming committee in the bitter cold.The capsule’s first trip to space began with a smooth rocket ride from Cape Canaveral on Friday. But barely half an hour into the flight, it failed to fire its thrusters to give chase to the space station and ended up in the wrong orbit.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The problem was with the Starliner’s internal clock – it did not sync up with the Atlas V rocket, throwing off the capsule’s timing.The capsule burned so much fuel trying to orient itself in orbit that there was not enough left for a space station rendezvous. Flight controllers tried to correct the problem, but between the spacecraft’s position and a gap in communications, their signals did not get through. They later managed to reset the clock.Boeing is still trying to figure out how the timing error occurred. The mission lasted nearly  hours and included  orbits around the Earth.Nasa is uncertain whether it will demand another test flight from Boeing – to include a space station visit – before putting its astronauts on board.Boeing had been shooting for its first astronaut mission in the first half of . This capsule is supposed to be recycled for the second flight with crew."},{"url":null,"title":"502427","story":"The Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Martin Kearney, would like to wish everyone across the district a very happy, safe and peaceful Christmas.He said: “While for most of us Christmas is a time of happiness, joy and celebration, it’s important we all spare a thought for those who are living in poverty or experiencing hardship at this time of year. Many children and young people in the district will unfortunately not wake up to lots of presents under the tree or enjoy a full tummy after the much anticipated Christmas dinner. While I wholly appreciate that Christmas can be a very financially challenging time for most, I would strongly encourage anyone who is in a position to do so, to make a donation, no matter how small, to a local food bank or toy appeal to help give these children and young people the Christmas they dream of, and deserve.”He continued: “Christmas can also be an extremely dficult and sad time of the year for many, including those who have lost loved ones, are in poor health, or are living alone. I would ask that we all give a little extra consideration to the plight of others this Christmas and carry out one small act of kindness, whether it’s just stopping in on an elderly neighbour, or inviting someone living alone to dinner. This small act will mean a great deal to them and could just make their Christmas.“I have really enjoyed my first six months as Chair of Mid Ulster District Council and I would like to sincerely thank everyone in the district for making me feel so welcome and for involving me in their community events and indeed in their communities. It was an absolute privilege to attend all of the Christmas Lights Switch On events, it was a total joy to see so many smiley, happy young faces absorbing it all and to me that’s what it’s all about. Thank you to all the community organisations in Mid Ulster who work so tirelessly and selflessly all year round for the betterment of the district. Your hard work and unwavering commitment is greatly appreciated and admired.”“I wish you all a very happy, safe and peaceful Christmas and look forward to seeing and working with you all again in the New Year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

LSC project is a Peace IV funded programme that The Verbal, in partnership with The Housing Executive, are currently delivering. It’s a four-year programme working across Northern Ireland delivering Reading Rooms to ious cross communities. As the event coincided with International Human Rights Day, guests were also treated to a fascinating workshop led by Roberta Bacic, curator of ‘Embracing Human Rights’ exhibition.  The exhibition uses textiles, namely ‘arpilleras’ to depict a iety of themes including local and international issues, human rights issues and the experience of new communities. As part of the event, which was held on Tuesday, volunteers also took part in a festive-themed Reading Rooms session before having lunch together. Speaking following the event, LSC Programme Director, Andrea Doran said: “Our LSC project is about maximising meaningful community integration by working with others, giving back to the community and developing awareness and understanding. We used Tuesday’s event to give something back to the people who make it possible for us to deliver our programme. We felt that International Human Rights Day was a fitting day to do this.” Concluding, Mrs Doran said: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our fantastic volunteers who have worked tirelessly throughout the year to bring communities together. What they have achieved in the short le-time of the project is remarkable. We’re really looking forward to continuing that great work with all our LSC volunteers and groups in the new year.”Gareth Doran, Housing Executive Listen Share Change Northern Sector Co-Ordinator, has also been working with the LSC Project to deliver the Reading Rooms model in the Northern sector. He said: “The first year of this project has been a massive success, and I would like to thank all the groups for their participation in Listen Share Change year one programme and hopefully continuing to engage with them into year two.“Special thanks must go to all the volunteers for the time they invested in the project, their contribution has been amazing,” he said.

From Princess Diana to Strabane-born astronomer Annie Maunder, the audience was treated to a erse and eclectic showcase of women’s histories.Dr Maeve O’Brien, programme co-ordinator of the Herstory Project, said: “This project, and the women whose lives we have profiled, shows that women’s histories – whether of ‘bad’ or ‘good’ women – are alive and well in the minds of women in our community.” Dr OBrien added the showcase showed that women in the North West had a “treasure trove”of stories to tell. She concluded: “It is essential that these stories be written down and recorded to ensure that the lives of all remarkable women – including our own - are never forgotten.”  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since I began practising it, I have never been in better shape physically and mentally.“I found the method two years ago after suffering from chronic adrenal fatigue and depression. I wasnt finding answers from the doctors or the medication and I was fearing that this was the way things were going to be from then on.“But, then I came across the Wim Hof method and after just one session I got the first indication that something had worked in my body. After a week, I felt completely dferent and after a month, I’d never felt as good in my le.”So convinced is he of the benefits of the Wim Hof method, Deane is determined to ensure it is available locally. “I travelled back and forth to the Netherlands learning directly from Wim Hof and now I am one of only a handful of qualied instructors in Ireland. “I believe this can be a game changer for athletes and anyone of any age who is looking to make a positive intervention in their own health and well-being. It will also be hugely beneficial to singers, public speakers and anyone in need of boosting their self-confidence.“The Wim Hof method has been subject to a number of major scientic studies and the conclusions are clear regarding the improvements on general well-being, mood, anxiety and panic disorders, depression, heart health, inflammation diseases, respiratory system and even athletic performance.” He concluded: “It’s a simple method but the results are truly amazing.”Deane, who is also a human blueprint coach yoga teacher and breathing coach, now runs a company called PrimalEire offering instruction in the Wim Hof method. Every Sunday morning he invites people to the beach to explore the cold water under professional supervision and to explain its many benefits. He will be running a day’s funda- mentals workshop at DQ Fitness in Newtown- cunningham on December th, further details of which can be found through Facebook at PrimalEire or Aaron Deane. He added: “I have had the benefit of learning from the Dutch master himself but anyone can grasp the fundamentals of the Wim Hof method so why not come along, embrace the cold and change your le for the better.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The competition aims to encourage interest in Mandarin Chinese language and Chinas culture, with Mandarin ranked as one of the most vital languages to the UK over the next twenty years.This is the third year the competition has taken place in the North and saw entrants from both groups and iniduals, with abilities ranging from beginner to advanced. Speaking at the competition was Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland.“Congratulations to all of the pupils from Lumen Christi College who took to the stage today speaking in Mandarin. “Like last year, the standards during today’s heat were very high and we hope again to see some of the students in London for the UK final. This competition allows pupils to demonstrate the hard work and effort they have put into learning Mandarin. It’s really important that more young people have the chance to learn languages such as Mandarin, which provides an important insight into dferent ways of thinking and living. Languages open up exciting study, travel and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Elaine said: “It’s great to see present and past residents from both communities of Rosemount reconnecting this is an amazing event as it brings our communities together to share stories and laughter, regardless of age, ability, religion and culture.“Having the event at this time of year is deliberate as the weather is getting colder and our older generation are less inclined to go out.“We really appreciate the Housing Executive funding this cross community celebration, without their contributions this could not happen. “Once again,  old and vulnerable people had dinner and enjoyed a great night’s craic.”Dalton said: “This event would not be possible without the support of our community. “ A big thanks must go to the many volunteers who helped make the evening one to remember. “They went above and beyond to give out personal, hand delivered invitations, ensuring everyone was made to feel welcome.”Housing Executive patch manager for the area, Donna Kelly, was also at the dinner. She said it was an “excellent opportunity” for the Rosemount community to reconnect.”Concluding, Ms Kelly said: “They continue to reach out and keep in touch to build new friendships, and that’s always a good thing for the city.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The origin tale of the lake, known as ‘The Death of Eochaidh son of Mairid” is over a thousand years old in oral tradition, but has now been brought up to date in a new telling by children’s author, Maacuteire Zepf.Liacute Ban’s story is tale bursting with colour, from giant horses and ancient gods to mermaids and monks. It tells of a young girl who is transformed into a mermaid when a magical curse floods their ringfort, creating Lough Neagh Six Irish-medium primary schools in the Mid-Ulster area have been working on the story with Maacuteire Zepf over the past months, writing their own creative responses and drawing original illustrations for the story.The young writers and illustrators from Dungannon, Coalisland, Magherafelt, Ballinascreen, Cookstown and Tirkane then came together at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy earlier this month for a collaborative showcase performance of their work, to celebrate the project and to hear the story told in its entirety. The story of Liacute Ban is deeply rooted in the locality of the area, mentioning local places by name. References to the legend can also be spotted in many local place names.The project has been funded by a partnership between the Irish Writers’ Centre in Dublin and Mid-Ulster District Council.Martin Kearney, chairperson of Mid-Ulster District Council, attended the event. He said: “The story of Eochaidh and Liacute Ban shows just how rich and deep our local culture really is.

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour.However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon.  Atari launched the first home video games console in . The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home.By , one of Atari’s founders, Nolan Bushell, employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System .Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge.There were, however, eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong - the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in .Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later.Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound.But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball.” googletag.cmd.push  The Nerf Ball sold in its millions after its launch in . The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in its first year in existence.  The Evel Knievel Stunt Bike was one of the most popular toys of the decade. Undoubtedly, another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle.Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year, including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions.One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. googletag.cmd.push  Stretch Armstrong was relaunched  years after his debut in .  Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in , the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around five foot before reverting back to its normal shape.If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas, of course, sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionery for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long-gone Woolworth’s chain.  Cadburys honed in on a novel way of selling more chocolate in the s. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the “saved” two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something .  Ideals Crossfire table top game was also extremely popular.  First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns.  Star Wars toys are still selling in their millions  years on.  The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film.As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since.  CHECK OUT THE TOYS WE ALL GOT FOR CHRISTMAS IN THE s All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in .  Girls World allowed aspiring hairdressers and make-up artists to practice their skills.  If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s, Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised.She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her “stylist” to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using “human products” without much damage to the hair itself.  Tiny Tears won a Toy of the Year Award in the s.  Tiny Tears was the must- have “hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls.In the s, The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and won equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores.  The Bionic Woman doll cashed in on the success of the hit American TV show of the era.  Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series featured Jaime Sommers, who took on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series.Like its parent programme, The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset.A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin.  The Space Hopper was invented in Italy in the s.  Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which special- ised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

A bike  Ah yeah, straight out in the Christmas Day mass clothes cycling up and down the road like a lunatic. The holy grail of Christmas presents, lets be honest. . Roller Blades  These often resulted in great craic, as well as serious injury. There was always one friend who had fancy ones they got on a trip to America. The cheap ones with the bockety wheels were good enough for us - jumping down steps and all! googletag.cmd.push . Polly Pockets  Every girl in the s had one of these.

E Football Lumen Christi -Inver College - Derrys Lumen Christi College were crowned Ulster Nannery Cup champions after a hard fought win over Carrickmacross side Inver College in terrible conditions on Wednesday afternoon in Garvaghey. It is only the second time in its history that Lumen have won the competition but went into the final as favourites, having performed strongly throughout the competition.They were - to - semi-final winners over over St Aidans Derrylin - A strong and freezing wind combined with constant rain to make it very dficult for any decent football to be played. googletag.cmd.push However, to their credit, both sets of players did their best to put on an entertaining contest for the large crowd of supporters from both schools. With the wind behind their backs, it was Inver College who started the game more positively.The Monaghan side scored two points in the opening ten minutes. Despite playing into the strong wind, Lumen refused to lie down and took the game to their opponents. Lumen captain Mark Chester hold the Nannary Cup However, clear cut chances were at a premium as the game often got bogged down around the midfield area as players were hesitant to kick it long because of the windy conditions. googletag.cmd.push As the half wore on, Lumen were definitely the stronger side but had yet to convert that supremacy into scores. However, shortly before the half-time break, they got the breakthrough that they deserved. After some neat passing in the half forward line, midfielder Flionn McLaughlin broke through the Inver full back line and smashed the ball into the net, leaving the half-time score at - to - in favour of the Derry team. As the second-half got underway, Lumen would have been hoping to take advantage of the wind and they quickly went about doing to. Two points from Cathal Deery opened up a three-point gap and it looked like Lumen were getting ready to finish off their opponents. However, the game then swung on a pivotal moment. Inver were awarded a penalty and a goal wouldve levelled the game but the Inver penalty taker crashed his shot off the post. It was the boost Lumen needed but the next score was crucial and it soon arrived in Lumen’s favour through another well-taken goal from Flionn McLaughlin. His fellow midfielder Eoin Canavan then got in on the act, scoring a goal and a point to open up a comfortable lead for Lumen.Inver, to their credit, never gave up and continued battling in the closing stages. However, they were unable to register any more scores and Lumen held on to take the title.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us.

On the doorstep, people said they wanted the Assembly up and running and I think that that is going to happen.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was delighted to increase the partyrsquos vote by over  per cent.In  the party polled , votes which Brown increase to , votes last week, placing Alliance fourth in the South Down pecking order, just  votes behind the DUP.The Alliance man believes that the only way to unite people in South Down is toa cross-community candidate to Westminster, suggesting that the surge in support for his party was because people are ldquofed up with the current situation at Stormont.Brown also believes that Alliance is potentially edging towards a South Down Assembly seat given the strong constituency base that it now has and that he would be up for contesting any future election.Ulster Unionist Jill Macauley mdash who was delighted to increase the party vote by just over three percent mdash rising from , votes two years ago to , this time out, was one of bright lights of her partyrsquos Westminster campaign.She was delighted to increase the vote at what she described as ldquoturbulent political times and said it was clear on the doorstep that voters are angry with the conduct of the DUP and Sinn Fein and their lack of delivery.ldquoThe clear message from the electorate was that they want local politicians to get back to work and restore the Assembly and the Executive. The current health crisis was also a major concern and the impending emergency that faces our strangled education system, she said.ldquoWith the UUP share of the vote increasing in such a toxic environment, it encourages me that we must be doing something right. I hope voters will continue to put their faith in the Ulster Unionist Party as a vehicle in which unionism can move forward as an inclusive and modern movement, instead of the politics of fear we have all come to know.Aontuacute, which was contesting its first Westminster election, polled , votes,  less than the collective performance of its three candidates at the recent Newry, Mourne and Down Council election..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Im.jpg","title":"I’m here to serve you%2C says Shannon  ","story":"STRANGFORD MP Jim Shannon secured another convincing victory mdash albeit with a reduced vote mdash for the third time in last weekrsquos general election.The overall Strangford turnout vote was also down, just .% of the eligible electorate compared to .% turnout in .While Mr Shannon topped the poll with , votes out of , valid votes, it was a %on his last thumping win when he was the DUP MP with the biggest majority.This year that honour went to Ian Paisley in North Antrim, who was nearly , votes clear of his nearest rival.A committed Christian and a pro-le advocate, Mr Shannon appealed to nearly half of the Strangford voters, earning a . % share of the vote in what was always a one-horse race.However, as he and his election team stood while Stephen Farryrsquos North Down win for Alliance was announced at Bangorrsquos Aurora Centre around am on Friday morning, there was an air of sombreness and distinct lack of celebration mdash perhaps due to news which had filtered through that party colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly were in danger of losing their seats.The ing officer seemed to be in a rush to make the Strangford announcement as Dr Farry was unable to make his acceptance speech until after Mr Shannonrsquos victory was announced.Mr Shannonrsquos  year-old mother, Mona, who lives near Kircubbin, was there to support him, as was his we, Sandra.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

David McConville‘‘I was born at home, my big brother was three and my sister was six,’’ said David.‘‘My mother came down the stairs and said ‘Look what Santa brought you’. My brother burst into tears and said ‘I wanted an Action Man!’.’’.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It may not have been David’s brother’s idea of a dream present, but for many parents a Christmas Day baby is the ultimate gt. According to an old superstition, ‘The child born on Christmas Day will have a special fortune’ .Christmas is all about one man’s birthday - and David, from Lurgan, is one of a very small number of people who share the auspicious date with Jesus Christ. So does it mean double the parties, double the celebrations and, most importantly, double the presents  It does for David. ‘‘I got my presents in the morning from Santa and I got my birthday present and a wee cake in the afternoon. I never felt like I was missing out.’’David, who works as a window cleaner, is one of six children, and every December  each of his siblings gives him a birthday card withmoney.‘‘They still buy me something for Christmas too,’’ he said. The largesse extends to his children, who make sure to spoil their dad. ‘‘My son Mark brought me to Sunderland for a Sunderland and Arsenal match for my th birthday. He paid for the flights, hotel and tickets. It was brilliant.Number of affordable homes at Corbys Priors Hall will reduceSam McBride: Stormont couldeven weaker and less accountable than before Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"‘‘My other son Luke makes me a CD for Father’s Day and a CD for my birthday. He’s been doing it for me since he was about seven. He’s now .’’David said he’s never thought about holding his birthday on a dferent day from Christmas. ‘‘It has never even come into my head because I’m happy enough.’’Being born on Christmas Day means there will doubtless be plenty of bad jokes like, ‘are you and Jesus twins are you actually Jesus Christ ’. It also means plenty of funny stories.David said: ‘‘Before the christening, when I was only three or four days old, my mum wanted to call me Gabriel, after the angel Gabriel. My dad and my godfather had been out for a drink to celebrate and they came back home and my dad said to me, ‘What about you wee Gabby’ and my ma said ‘That’s it, he’s being called after you’ - my da is called David.’’Many hold the view that Christmas could well be the most advantageous day on which to be born, asit comes with a guaranteed jollity, lots of feasting and a party atmosphere.But, of course, it could also be used by Scrooge-like loved ones as an excuse to halve your annual allowance of presents.Most of us enjoy being the centre of attention on our birthday, but those born on Christmas Day may struggle for the limelight.Instead of being the most wonderful, sparkly, tinsel-filled day ever, both celebrations may be diluted. It couldalso be a tad lonely - December  is the rarest birthday , despite being perhaps the world’s most famous day.Given its rarity, it is most unusual then to discover that the two most exciting days of the calendar year fall together for two brothers - who are not twins. David Murphy and his brother Noel were both born on Christmas Day, exactly six years apart. Noel, who was born in  and lives in Dungannon, said he felt a ‘wee bit annoyed’ that he wasn’t born on a dferent date. ‘‘Obviously you miss out on a birthday present and a birthday party because I got the both of them as Christmas. ‘‘Then as I got a bit older I realised that there was a fair good chance that I was going to be off school on my birthday and off work, so that evened it out a bit. Once I was old enough to realise birthdays and Christmases were just the same, I just accepted it and got on with it.’’ There mayhave been a lack of fanfare over his birthday, but Noel said his late grandfather never forgot to mark the occasion. ‘‘He lived with us for a long time and used to make a wee point and give me a few shillings or a p and he would say to me ‘that’s for your birthday’.’’ Noel added: ‘‘December was a busy month for us all. Obviously with my brother David being on Christmas Day as well, and our middle brother was born on December  which was also my mother and father’s wedding anniversary.’’Like many Christmas Day babies, Noel was bestowed witha Christmassy name. ‘‘My mother tells the story, I’m not sureit’s true or not, that whenever I was born and being carried out of the delivery room down to the ward, there were three of four nurses waiting there andthey all starting singing ‘Noelle, Noelle’, and that’s how I got named,’’ said Noel. ‘‘I was born in South Tyrone Hospital and in those days being born on Christmas Day was a big thing. The nurses had been waiting all day on somebody giving birth. I think I was born at .pm, but I was the first Christmas Day baby that particular year.’’Noel’sbirthdays past may have been without occasion, but these dayshis three grown-up children Laura, Jill and Richard, make sureto get him separate presents for Christmas and his birthday. ‘‘My son-in-law is a photographer and every year he makes us a calendar with photographs of our two grandchildren. ‘‘The oldest grandchild Chloe was at our house recentlyand was marking off dates on the calendar - she came to the th and she wrote ‘Granda’s birthday’,’’ he laughed. Brother David, an electrician who lives in Portadown, was born at home on Christmas Day , and he too has a Biblical name.‘‘When the midwe came out she said to my mother ‘Would you do me a favour and call him David’, he said. Reflecting on his younger days David said: ‘‘We never had birthday cakes...the first birthday cake I remember getting was for my th. It was a dferent era now it’s totally dferent - you can get cards with Christmas birthday.When we were young there was nothing like that - you got a birthday card at all it was a bonus.‘‘It wasn’t until late primary school, going into secondary school, I realised that people had a birthday and Christmas separate’’ And David has plenty of funny stories relating to his unusual birth date.‘‘Many of years ago when my son was at primary school the teacher asked ‘Who was born on Christmas Day ’. He shot up his hand and said ‘My daddy’. She took it with a pinch of salt and later on she asked the same question, ‘Who was born on Christmas Day ’ and this time he said ‘My uncle Noel!’.’’try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

Yet in Kafaesque style that element of the talks has been as secretive as the Stormont which existed until January .Arlene Foster, Michelle O’Neill and senior civil servants talk about mending their ways and acting to such basic standards of government as minute-taking and obeying the law.Yet it takes greatfaith to believe that largely the same people running largely the same system will produce a markedly dferent result.Ben Lowry: So much for Boris Johnson helping unionists out of a sense of guilt for his betrayal of them Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"We should be sceptical rather than cynical and it is possible that there has been a genuine damascene conversion. The greatest incentive towards improved behaviour is the glimpse of public fury which politicians and civil servants observed over the RHI scandal – followed by the recent electoral punishment for the DUP and Sinn Fein.Allied to that is the realisation that the practices of Stormont ultimately proved destructive. What might in a state of hubris have seemed than an untopplable institution in which the DUP and Sinn Féin would forever be joint masters now must look very dferent on the other side of the RHI Inquiry’s probing into dark corners and three years of powerlessness.However, there is at least one reason to believe thatStormont s in coming weeks it could be even less productive than that which spectacularly imploded three years ago.In , for the first time since , Stormont finally came to have an official opposition, ending a position in which all but a handful of MLAs were members of governing parties.The SDLP, UUP and Alliance joined smaller parties such as the TUV and People Before Profit in sitting outside the government. Thanks to the enterprising John McCallister, Stormont’s rules were changed to ensure speaking time for the opposition and the ability to ask questions of Stormont ministers.What in any other society would be considered the basic building blocks of a democratic system radically altered how Stormont ed, evenmost of us could not fully see that at the time.Recently the respected think tank the Institute for Government published a report on the Stormont vacuum. The authors spent time talking to senior Stormont civil servants and buried in their final report is this fascinating line: “The decision of the UUP and SDLP not to join the last administration created [an opposition] for the first time – exposing the executive to a degree of accountability that officials told us ministers found uncomfortable.”For the first time, the Assembly became a chamber which wielded real power of its own, showing that executive power is only one form of governmental influence. Rather than being subservient to the Executive, the Assembly asserted itself as a genuine forum for debate and for minsters being held to account.Although uncomfortable, that was ultimately in the Executive’s strategic interests it would only surviveseen to be part of a credible institution rather than one which articially shut down challenge. But such a change carried risk for parties unused to such scrutiny and their handling of the new reality exposed the Executive’s inadequacies.It is unlikely that Stormont would have fallen over the RHI scandal had it not been for an opposition harrying ministers, demanding answers, calling witnesses before hearings of Stormont committees and providing an alternative administration.Some people – including perhaps some people in the NIO – might say that the collapse of Stormont is a good argument against opposition.But that is a simplistic understanding of the scale of Stormont’s problems. The entire edice was built on sand andit had not fallen over RHI, it was probably inevitable that collapse would come over something  – and the longer spads, ministers and civil servants acted as they did unchecked, the more destructive they became.\u2028The opposition parties had less than a year and, with the exception of Alliance, fared poorly in the Assembly election following collapse.For that reason, they appear keen to go back in to a new Executive – and Sinn Féin in particular appears desperate to ensure that the SDLP commits to doing so, itself a hint of Sinn Féin concern at facing full-throated criticism rather than the necessarily muted iety possible from a government partner.If that happens, then ironically a Stormont which fell in large part because of secrecy and a lack of accountability could be more secretive and less accountable.And regardless of what happens with the smaller parties, a new Executive is likely to be weaker at the top. Arlene Foster is a greatly diminished figure from the politician who once presided over Stormont like a queen and who – it is now almost forgotten – was for almost a year an exceptionally popular leader of unionism.Wounded after last week’s latest electoral disaster and fighting internally for her career as ious DUP sharks circle, Mrs Foster is both weak within unionism and a leader who is now instinctively loathed by most nationalists.Similarly, Michelle O’Neill carries none of the gravitas of Martin McGuinness and is now in an unprecentedly weak position for a Sinn Fein leader, with a third of her party having recently voted against her and in favour of John O’Dowd while she has shown an inability to make the sort of grand reconciling gestures which became associated with Mr McGuinness in his latter years.This week the efforts at the talks, such as we can discern, appear to be around issues such as an Irish language act and reform of the petition of concern, something which is almost tangential to the scale of the problem.Much is at stake: If devolution is rushed back and fails again, the public may not give it a third chance.try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
